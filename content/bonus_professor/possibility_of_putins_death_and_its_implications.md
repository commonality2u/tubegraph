Professor Valery Solovey discusses [[rumors_of_vladimir_putins_death_and_its_implications | rumors of Vladimir Putin's death]] and their far-reaching [[potential_consequences_of_putins_death | implications]] for Russia's political future, asserting his certainty about Putin's demise and detailing potential scenarios for the transfer of power and the country's direction.

## Confirmation and Sources
Valery Solovey has consistently affirmed that [[rumors_of_vladimir_putins_death_and_its_implications | Vladimir Putin is no longer alive]], stating he knows this "absolutely for sure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. He views himself as a primary and reliable source of this information, alongside the anonymous Telegram channel General SVR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Solovey notes that while many independent and dependent American publications have responded to the topic with a "question mark" since October 26, they are not entirely silent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

He references a study published by the LANN Institute, which collected "indirect evidence" supporting [[rumors_of_vladimir_putins_death_and_its_implications | Putin's death]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. A translation of this study is available on Solovey's Telegram channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Cause of Death
While not explicitly detailed, Solovey confirms that Putin ultimately died of [[putins_health_and_its_influence_on_Russian_politics | cancer]], which had been widely discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

## Succession and Power Transfer
With Putin reportedly deceased, discussions about the transfer of power are underway, primarily spearheaded by [[potential_changes_in_russian_leadership_and_implications | Nikolai Patrushev]], whom Solovey identifies as the "supreme ruler of Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

### The Double: Vasilyevich
A key element of the current strategy involves utilizing "Vasilyevich," identified as Putin's double, who is currently acting president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. This double is intended to facilitate the transfer of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

### Dmitry Patrushev
Nikolai Patrushev is actively pushing for the transfer of power to his son, Dmitry Patrushev, which would be enacted through Vasilyevich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Solovey describes Dmitry as young and part of a new generation accustomed to luxury and operating under the shadow of influential parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. While Dmitry is considered not evil, a "very big advantage for modern Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>, Solovey expresses doubts about his ability to effectively manage Russia without dismantling the "Putin system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

## Future of Russia and Key Policy Implications
The "Putin era is over," and a new historical era is beginning in Russia, though it may not yet be widely apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

### Russian Political System
A parliamentary republic is unlikely to be established in Russia during the transitional period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Instead, transitional norms would be introduced into a new Constitution, with a referendum on the form of government possible in 10-12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

The ideal future Russian president, according to Solovey, should possess "love for the Motherland" and "common sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

### War in Ukraine
Russia is not formally at war but is engaged in a "special military operation" or "intense military action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Unilateral ceasefires are possible but unsustainable without mutual agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Solovey believes a truce, if not lasting peace, will be reached next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. He dismisses the "Arestovich plan" for Ukraine's NATO membership as actually the "Kissinger plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, and considers it unfeasible due to a lack of political will and societal support in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

Regarding potential military success against Ukraine, Solovey states Russia is not achieving these successes, and the risk for Moldova should not be exaggerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

### Nuclear War
The probability of nuclear war is decreasing. However, if Patrushev perceives a threat to his power from the West, he may consider using nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

### Civil Unrest and Political Crisis
While a civil war and the collapse of Russia due to a Kadyrov march on Moscow are possible, Solovey considers the probability "insignificant" but does not reject it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. He anticipates a political crisis engulfing Russia, beginning with a crisis of the Russian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>.

### Propaganda and Information Control
The Russian propaganda machine operates on simple principles: eliminating alternative points of view, suppressing influential opposition media, and constant repetition of government messages. This leads to "stupefaction and debilization" of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. Destroying this machine would allow the majority of the population to "come to their senses" within months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.

### Return of Prigozhin
Yevgeny Prigozhin is currently in Venezuela but plans to return when a "favorable situation" arises, specifically when the political crisis in Russia escalates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>. He could potentially receive a pardon if he plays a significant role in "liberating Russia" from the Putin system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

### Future Economic Changes
Significant changes in the financial and monetary spheres are expected as a side effect of the impending crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. A denomination of currency is planned, likely in the fall of next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>.

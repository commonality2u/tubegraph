The appointment of the Russian Prime Minister and the formation of a new government in Russia were not predetermined outcomes, but rather the result of an intense struggle within the Russian elite, significantly influenced by China. Predictions made over several months about the increased turbulence during government formation and the prominence of the Chemezov and Patrushev coalitions proved to be highly accurate, with an 85-90% success rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This demonstrates the skillful use of insider information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The ongoing conflict between these two powerful coalitions, alongside other elite groups, continues to shape [[russian_internal_politics_and_economy | Russian domestic politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## The Role of China in Prime Ministerial Appointment

Initially, an agreement was reached by the end of November for Dmitry Patrushev to become Prime Minister, with expectations of a radical 75-80% renewal of the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Dmitry Patrushev was also considered the heir to the individual acting as President Putin, who is, in fact, a double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. However, by mid-February, these plans faced "insurmountable resistance" from the Chemezov coalition, which categorically opposed Dmitry Patrushev's candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

This created a stalemate where Patrushev's coalition supported Dmitry Patrushev, and Chemezov's coalition backed Denis Manturov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Compromise options were explored, including Anton Vaino, head of the presidential administration, who declined the offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Another compromise candidate was a security official, and Alexei Dyumin also appeared as a late candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### Mishustin's Candidacy and Chinese Advocacy

From April onwards, a new figure emerged for whom [[legitimization_of_russian_leadership_in_china | China was advocating]]: Mikhail Mishustin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Chinese officials insisted that Mishustin become Prime Minister because he was personally favored by Xi Jinping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Mishustin had given a solemn promise to fulfill all obligations towards China that were assumed by the late President Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This led to speculation among "evil but informed tongues" that Mishustin resembled a "sad panda," the national symbol of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Conditions for a Presidential Visit

The Chinese comrades agreed to arrange a visit for the so-called president (the double of the late President Putin) to Beijing in mid-May, but *only* on the condition of Mishustin's appointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This condition highlights the direct influence China exerted on the appointment of the Russian Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

## [[russias_political_and_economic_relations_with_china | Russia's Dependence on China]]

The influence of [[chinese_influence_on_russianukraine_conflict | China]] caused significant irritation among the Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. They recognize Russia's critical dependence on China in both military and economic spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. Without important Chinese support, Russia would struggle to conduct military operations for an extended period or keep its economy afloat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.

### Military and Economic Reliance

The Russian elite understands their reliance, but the "humiliation of having someone from the outside dictate their will" and having to seek China's "label for reigning" creates "very strong internal tension" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. China served as the "straw of the last salt shaker" that tipped the balance in favor of Mishustin's appointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

### Elite Dissatisfaction

This external influence, coupled with the existing tension between the Chemezov and Patrushev coalitions, is expected to intensify sharply and "inevitably soon be discharged" in a direct form, potentially leading to bloodshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. The two opposing coalitions, Chemezov's and Patrushev's, remain in force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. The compromise reached regarding Mishustin's appointment and the vice-premierships is considered "rotten" and "unstable" by the parties involved, with no one viewing it as long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. The expectation is that within 6-8 months, there will be an "exit of mercenaries from power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

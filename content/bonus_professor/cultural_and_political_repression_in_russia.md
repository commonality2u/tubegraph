This article is based on the 19th episode of Valery Solovey's YouTube program, recorded on July 3, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Key topics include back to the future, defeat from victories, whether Putin's ambitions are decreasing, and the government's declaration to the Russian people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## The Broadening Scope of Control

The Russian government has explicitly declared that citizens will now "work around the clock and without days off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This is accompanied by the FSB's directive to "beat your own so that strangers are afraid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, suggesting a policy of internal control.

### Mobilization Economy and Its Impact on Labor

The government has proposed amendments to federal law to introduce "special measures in the sphere of the economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. These measures mean that firms, organizations, and enterprises, regardless of their form of ownership, will be prohibited from refusing government orders and contracts related to the armed actions of the Russian Federation outside Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. This is likened to the Soviet era when the economy was heavily connected to the military-industrial complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

Furthermore, these special measures allow authorities to change contract terms during implementation and interfere with labor relations within organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. This implies that employees can be forced to work at night, on weekends, and holidays, potentially without vacations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. This situation is compared to the lead-up to June 1941 in the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. The Kremlin is described as being drawn into a strategic trap, increasing its efforts and depleting resources—material, human, and moral—while the world moves forward, and Russia slides into social, technological, and economic degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. This inglorious path is attributed to the efforts of the Kremlin and the Russian President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

## Political Crackdown on Critics

The Kremlin's primary concern has shifted from liberal critics (mostly broadcasting from outside Russia) to "turbo-patriots" or "hurray patriots" within Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. These "super loyalists" criticize the Kremlin for perceived concessions or for not being harsh enough in the special military operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. The FSB has been instructed to "thin out the ranks of the zealous critics on the right," ensuring that only the Kremlin determines what is fair and needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. Regardless of one's stance on the special operation, citizens are expected to "keep your mouth shut and enthusiastically approve with stormy applause turning into an ovation all the actions of the authorities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. This highlights the severe [[repression_and_political_climate_in_russia | political climate]] and limitations on [[human_rights_and_freedom_of_speech_in_russia | freedom of speech in Russia]].

### Arrest of Vladimir Mau

A significant event in the realm of [[discussion_of_repressive_practices_and_internal_politics_in_russia | internal politics]] was the house arrest of Vladimir Mau, a highly influential rector and head of the Academy of National Economy and Public Administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. Despite being a co-author of significant books and a good manager, his arrest sends a clear signal to "systemic liberals" that their loyalty is "worth absolutely nothing" in the eyes of the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. This exemplifies the increasing [[repressive_laws_and_political_commentary_in_russia | repressive laws and political commentary in Russia]].

## Cultural Simplification

Beyond political figures, [[sociopolitical_changes_in_russia | repression]] has also extended to the cultural sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. The Gogol Center was closed and reverted to the Gogol Theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. This closure is seen as a consequence of the government introducing a mobilization regime, which leads to "simplification" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. Under this regime, "no cultural complexities" are acceptable, regardless of whether they are oppositional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. The expectation is that everything must be "uniform" to be considered "beautiful and loyal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. This illustrates the impact of [[media_censorship_and_freedom_of_information_in_russia | media censorship and freedom of information in Russia]] on cultural institutions.

## Economic Control and "Freeloaders"

For those who believed they could earn something or be an investor in Russia, the government's stance is clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>. Gazprom's refusal to pay dividends for the first time since 1998, on direct orders from the state, sent a message to private investors: they are considered "freeloaders," not investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. The state's message is that "nothing belongs to you and will never belong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>, especially as the regime enters a state of mobilization economy, which brings "restrictions of cruelty," "harshness," "simplification," and "pressure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.

## Outlook

The future for Russia is described as one of increased pressure and simplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. Citizens are urged to help each other, support those trying to preserve common sense and human dignity, and assist those who face [[sociocultural_and_political_changes_in_postputin_russia | sociopolitical changes]] in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>. Despite the current difficulties, there is a belief that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

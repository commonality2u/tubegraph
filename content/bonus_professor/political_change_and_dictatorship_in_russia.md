From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

Valery Solovey presents the third issue of his program "Answers to Hot Questions," addressing topical inquiries from the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This program, which includes questions he personally finds amusing, is intended to provide insights into current events and future prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Future Government Policies and Reforms
Should Solovey's "team" come to power, several significant reforms are anticipated:

### Civil Service and Epilepsy
Current legislation is considered imperfect, prohibiting individuals with epilepsy from civil service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The team plans to change this law to allow people with mild forms of epilepsy to work in the civil service, considering it a solvable problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. History shows many outstanding statesmen and political figures were epileptics, such as Gaius Julius Caesar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Church and State Separation
Under the new government, the church will be truly separated from the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. It will no longer interfere in public education affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The church itself will decide if it needs reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### International Relations and Integration
Russia's policy will *not* be aimed at joining NATO and the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The immediate task for new forces in power, after the cessation of hostilities, is to establish normal working relations with European institutions and NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Consultations on this matter are already underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. It is believed that most sanctions could be lifted within 2-3 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Lustration in the Judicial System
All judges, including those in the Supreme and Constitutional Courts, will be subject to lustration without exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. However, employees of the judicial apparatus, such as clerks and case manufacturers, will generally not be subject to lustration as they do not make decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. High-level officials like heads of departments in the Supreme Court might be an exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. The process of lustration for the judicial corps will take some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Property Rights and Legal Reform
Laws and by-laws that worsen living conditions or harm people will be repealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. Those who suffered under such laws, like the KRT (comprehensive development of the territory) law which allows taking private property, will receive compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. A special department or service, possibly called the "Department of Management" or "Service for the Restoration of Constitutional Legality," will be created for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

### Economic Program
The new government has a detailed and high-quality economic program that will be introduced by "General SVR" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>. This program aims to increase the cost of living, family benefits, and pensions, while regulating price rises to prevent a counter-response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>.

### Migrant Problem
The migrant problem will be solved comprehensively and systematically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>. This includes reducing the visa regime and, if necessary, conducting mass deportations of those who illegally obtained Russian citizenship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>.

### Relocation of Capital
The speaker, who was once a supporter of moving Russia's capital to Siberia (suggesting "Vladisibirsk") to reflect a shift in economic and demographic focus to the Asia-Pacific region, is now less enthusiastic about the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. He suggests distributing capital functions among several cities, similar to the Constitutional Court's move to St. Petersburg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>.

## Nature and Persistence of the Dictatorship
The dictatorship in Russia will end when people actively fight against it, rather than waiting for it to change on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. Many people in society are satisfied with the current regime or are afraid of any [[change_in_the_political_landscape_in_russia | change]], preferring the "most terrible status quo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. This is attributed to a pervasive cowardice, which is partly a result of state policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.

The speaker notes that the current [[political_crisis_and_instability_in_russia | political crisis]] and changes in the political elite, such as arrests of generals, are "incomparable with everything that has happened in the last 25 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>. He warns that the current [[political_situation_in_russia | political crisis]] is "more than relevant" and unfolding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>.

### The Role of Propaganda
To fix the situation with millions of Russians supporting the Putinist regime and revanchist ideas, one needs to "turn off the propaganda switch" and re-socialize the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>. It is necessary to explain that Russia's true interests lie within Russia itself, focusing on a peaceful, free, and prosperous life, without threatening other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.

### Putin's Double and International Recognition
The speaker reiterates that a double is ruling Russia, which is visible to the "naked eye" and is a "pathetic copy" of the deceased Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>. He questions why the Americans should solve Russia's problems or liberate them from dictatorship, emphasizing that Russians themselves must act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>. The official announcement of Putin's death is not seen as significant for the people, as the real change depends on public action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>.

## Current Events and Challenges

### Mobilization
The question of mobilization is continuously discussed, with the military insisting on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. However, a decision is not expected before August or closer to autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. A hybrid operation, which does not require a significant military contingent, can be carried out simultaneously with mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Recent cases of unfit young people being illegally sent to the army suggest a general instruction to recruit anyone who does not resist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>.

### Army Generals and FSB Influence
Army generals, despite commanding forces, immediately allow FSB officers to deprive them of everything, acting like Red Army commanders in the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Military counterintelligence within the FSB is "extremely effective" at preventing resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. The question is posed to the public: "Why did we allow to do to you what was done to us with our society and with our country?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

### Nuclear Weapons
The current Kremlin team responsible for Russia's military policy is described as more realistic and less "bloodthirsty" than the late Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. They understand the risks of using tactical nuclear weapons and are not likely to use them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. There is an oral agreement with the Americans that nuclear weapons will not be used, explaining the calm reaction from the US to rhetorical threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>.

### China's Influence
The speaker's team was the first to warn about secret agreements signed with China that diminish Russian sovereignty, potentially turning Russia into a "semi-colony" of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. China's condition for political and military support to Russia is that Russia remains silent about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:59">[00:32:59]</a>.

### Russian Agents in Poland
The speaker confirms that part of Russia's hybrid operation involves destabilizing European countries, particularly those supporting Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>. Russia possesses an extensive spy network, typically handled by military intelligence, which prefers to operate under a foreign flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

## Social and Economic Concerns

### Russian-Speaking Population in Kazakhstan
No significant issues are expected for the Russian-speaking population in Kazakhstan, unlike past tensions in the 1990s and early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. The new government in Russia plans to protect its compatriots using "civilized and peaceful" means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

### "Birch" Stores
The planned opening of "Birch" stores in Moscow and St. Petersburg for customers like Ministry of Foreign Affairs employees and foreign diplomatic missions, where purchases can be made with foreign currency, is not seen as detrimental to ordinary citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. These stores will offer duty-free trade, leading to lower prices (15-25% cheaper) and providing a source of foreign currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

### WHO Agreements
Russia has disregarded all agreements with the WHO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### COVID-19 Epidemic
There is a noticeable increase in COVID-19 incidence in Moscow, which is being hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. Symptoms like fever, cough, sore throat, weakness, headaches, muscle pain, and loss of taste or smell indicate infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

### Food Security
While a crop failure is possible in Kazakhstan and some Russian regions, the speaker does not believe in the prospect of famine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:28">[00:41:28]</a>. However, a shortage of certain products, particularly cereals and possibly vegetable products, is anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.

### Ruble Denomination
A denomination of the ruble will be preceded by a severe crisis and high inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>. The consensus forecast of Russian economists predicts the dollar exchange rate will be in the range of 100-120 rubles per dollar this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

## Personal Reflections and Advice

### Dealing with Stress
To distract from serious and tragic news, the speaker suggests drinking tea and reading "Gorod Foolov," a channel that continues the tradition of Russian satire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. This method, likened to Saltykov-Shchedrin, helps to cope with "terribly serious" Russian reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

### Civic Activism
The speaker encourages safe forms of civic participation, such as subscribing to Telegram channels and providing small financial assistance, emphasizing that these actions are safe and feasible for individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>. He states that such engagement is a way to participate in the "fight against the dictatorship" and the "fight for the liberation of Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>.

> [!tip] Solovey's Warning
> "If you do not see that what is happening now, in particular arrests, changes in the political elite, are incomparable with everything that has happened in the last 25 years, I can only shrug and sympathize with you." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>

> [!quote] On Public Perception
> "You look but not see, to see but not understand, to listen but not hear." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>

He concludes by asserting, "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>.

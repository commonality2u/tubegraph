This article outlines the key political figures and power dynamics within Russia as observed in early 2023, focusing on military leadership changes, internal elite struggles, and economic considerations impacting the nation's direction.

## Key Appointments and Military Leadership

In mid-January 2023, General Gerasimov was appointed Chief of the General Staff and commander of a group of Russian troops in the "special military operation zone" [00:01:42]. This appointment was influenced by the challenging military situation between Russia and Ukraine [00:01:12], with "things were getting worse and worse every day" despite claims of "spectacular victory" in places like Soledar [00:01:33], [00:02:08]. The assault on Soledar reportedly began in August, with Berlin taken much faster in comparison [00:01:57], [00:02:03].

Vladimir Putin, understanding the dire military situation, decided it was time to "somehow end it" and "emerge victorious" [00:02:22]. He appointed General Gerasimov, described as "the best Russian General," an "excellent planner," a "person with strategic thinking," and "the author of the concept of hybrid warfare" [00:02:40], [00:02:46]. Gerasimov was reportedly endowed with "special emergency powers" and in return, was demanded "to ensure victory" [00:02:58], [00:03:07]. The definition of victory, potentially "honorable conditions of peace personally of President Putin," remains an open question [00:03:13].

## Internal Power Struggles and Elite Coalitions

A significant factor in Gerasimov's appointment was the growing influence of [[power_struggles_and_elite_coalitions_in_russia | Yevgeny Prigozhin]], described as Putin's protégé, who had become "excessively strong" [00:04:17], [00:04:20]. Prigozhin generated a "galaxy of influential ill-wishers" who conveyed concerns to the president about his potential to become "excessively dangerous" [00:04:25], [00:04:29].

General Gerasimov is identified as one of Prigozhin's "opponents and even antagonists" [00:04:41], [00:04:46]. With Gerasimov's appointment, Prigozhin's forces are now, "actually in subordination" to General Gerasimov [00:04:47], [00:04:52]. It is noted that a "significant part" of Prigozhin's fighters may have died during the assault on Soledar [00:04:55].

Despite the internal challenges, President Putin is "not interested in Prigozhin being removed from circulation" [00:05:24]. Prigozhin is seen as a "reliable tool" and "effective tool in the hands of President Putin" [00:05:31], [00:05:34]. However, Prigozhin himself is "preparing for Putin's future" by forming a resource base, controlling finances and media, and enjoying political weight and influence [00:05:42], [00:05:45]. His attempts to form a military resource received an "unexpected refurbishment from the president and part of the elite who decided that such excessive strengthening is not the president lithium is useless" [00:06:03]. This highlights [[russian_political_dynamics_and_power_struggles | domestic_russian_political_dynamics]] within the elite.

## Military and Economic Outlook

### Mobilization Efforts
There are ongoing discussions about a "new stage of mobilization" [00:06:43]. While press secretary Peskov refuted rumors of mobilization as "sabotage and provocations" [00:06:53], these rumors are "spread by the current authorities themselves" [00:07:04]. Information has surfaced about the cancellation of deferment for fathers of many children [00:07:08], and a proposed increase in the upper conscription age limit to 30 for spring draft, which is described as a "hidden form of mobilization" [00:07:23], [00:07:36]. Additionally, the issue of increasing military service length to two years is being discussed and is likely to be resolved positively by the fall 2023 draft [00:07:44], [00:07:51].

The **Times** newspaper, referencing MI6, reported that Russia is preparing for a "second stage of mobilization," potentially mobilizing up to half a million people in the first wave, with a total target of up to 2 million [00:10:13], [00:10:20], [00:10:30]. This prepares Russia for a "long" confrontation with Ukraine or "with the whole world" [00:12:34], [00:12:37].

### Military-Political Dynamics and Upcoming Events
Major military events are expected in the spring [00:08:11]. Both Russia and Ukraine are reportedly preparing for offensives [00:08:14], [00:08:35]. The Russian approach might involve a combination of "strategic defense against the Ukrainian offensive and then a transition to a counteroffensive" [00:08:27]. Ukraine, upon receiving tanks, may wait for Russian troops to exhaust themselves before launching a counterattack [00:08:35], [00:08:53]. This period in the spring is anticipated to unfold as "the most significant military battle of the 21st century," determining the outcome of the armed and political confrontation [00:09:12], [00:09:21].

The fate of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) is also linked to the military dynamics [00:11:45]. Statements by Armenian leader Pashinyan questioning Russia's defense role and suggesting recourse to the UN indicate the CSTO is "breathing on lat" [00:11:17], [00:11:29]. If Russia suffers a defeat, even a moderate one, the CSTO "will lose all meaning of its existence" [00:12:01], [00:12:17].

### Economic Challenges
Russia's ability to sustain military operations relies heavily on oil and gas exports [00:12:46]. Last week, the price of Russian Urals oil fell below $40 per barrel to $38.7, a record low since summer 2020 [00:12:53], [00:13:15], leading to decreasing export revenues and serious budget problems [00:13:23], [00:13:27]. With a price ceiling introduced from February 5, Russia could lose $100-$180 billion in foreign exchange earnings [00:13:30], [00:13:36]. These losses are expected to be compensated "at our expense" (the public's expense) [00:13:53], meaning "social expenses [and] expenses for economic development will be cut" [00:14:15]. This shift is described as "guns instead of oil" [00:14:24]. To mitigate losses, Russia is attempting to increase oil exports, with January showing a "sharply increased" volume compared to December [00:14:41], [00:14:52].

## Other Observations

### Alleged Suspicious Deaths in Defense Industry
A series of deaths within the Russian defense industry has raised concerns [00:00:55], [00:15:04].
*   On January 9, Pavel Kamenev, scientific director of Almaz Antey and developer of "infamous missiles caliber," died at 85 [00:15:13], [00:15:22].
*   On December 28, Vladimir Nesterov, general director of the Khrunichev center and leader of heavy missile projects, died at 73 [00:15:43], [00:15:58].
*   On December 24, Alexander Buzakov, general director of the Admiralty shipyards and manufacturer of caliber missiles, died at 66 [00:16:08], [00:16:14].

These three deaths of individuals "involved in design work, and in the defense industry, do not look like a coincidence" [00:16:26], [00:16:33]. This echoes "suicides or strange deaths of SL employees last year" [00:16:40].

### Allegations of Putin's Doubles
Reports from "evil but very knowledgeable tongues" suggest that the Russian president's alleged trip to Ufa to say goodbye to Murtaza Rakhimov, the first Bashkir president, was actually made by "one of his doubles," specifically "the first main double of the president" [00:17:23], [00:17:34], [00:17:40]. This double reportedly "very successfully coped with it" [00:17:48]. The speaker references Akira Kurosawa's film *Kagemusha* (Shadow of the Warrior) where a double replaces a killed prince, eventually believing himself to be the prince [00:18:02], [00:18:17]. This story, which ends tragically for the double and the principality, is used as a parallel to the current [[russian_sociopolitical_dynamics | Russian_sociopolitical_dynamics]] [00:18:44]. The use of doubles is noted as a practice not only in modern Russia but also in other countries and medieval Japan [00:19:02]. This raises questions about [[potential_political_transition_and_power_dynamics_in_russia | political_changes_and_power_dynamics_in_postPutin_Russia]].

### Kremlin Humor
A popular joke in the Kremlin last week, according to sources, was: "who will die faster Nikita Mikhalkov or about the DKB?" [00:10:50], [00:10:56], [00:11:00]. "Realists were betting on Mikhalkov," though he is still alive [00:11:05], [00:11:08]. This highlights a sense of "black humor" in the Kremlin [00:10:50].

## Future Outlook
The year 2023 is seen as a potentially decisive year, offering a "chance... to decisively influence our destiny the destiny of our people and our country" [00:21:43]. Despite current difficulties, there is an assertion that "victory will be ours" [00:22:12].

[[xi_jinpings_visit_to_moscow_and_its_implications | Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow]] was anticipated as a significant event, contrasting with the "information noise" often produced by [[health_and_public_appearances_of_president_putin | President Putin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The [[international_relations_and_diplomatic_stances_of_kremlin | Kremlin]] reportedly awaited this visit, referring to China as its "older brother" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Timing and Impact
The visit was scheduled to commence at noon on Monday, March 20th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. It was considered a true "event" because of its potential to genuinely influence both [[russias_political_and_economic_relations_with_china | Russian domestic and foreign policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. The results of the visit were expected to be assessable by late Tuesday evening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

## Putin's State Ahead of the Visit
[[health_and_public_appearances_of_president_putin | President Putin]] was noted to be "not in very good physical shape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Efforts were reportedly made over the weekend to improve his condition to prevent him from appearing "weakling" or "barely dragging his legs" before Xi Jinping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## China's Objectives
China's primary objective in its [[russias_political_and_economic_relations_with_china | relations with Russia]] is to advance its own goals and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. China aims to transform the [[international_relations_and_diplomatic_stances_of_kremlin | Russian Federation]] and its spheres of influence to serve Chinese interests, ensuring Russia remains "weak and ends up tied to China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

China does not desire a strong Russia, but rather a weakened one that is dependent on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. However, China also wishes to avoid an "absolute, complete defeat of Russia on the Ukrainian fronts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. This is because a significant defeat for Russia would be seen as a negative sign for China itself, suggesting that autocracies might lose when confronting a consolidated West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

### Peace Initiative
Despite China's strategic aims, its peace initiative for Ukraine is unlikely to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. The Americans have already stated, multiple times, that China's peace proposals are unacceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, a position also held by the Ukrainian leadership and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

## Implications for Russian Leadership
The visit, combined with the International Criminal Court's warrant for [[health_and_public_appearances_of_president_putin | President Putin]], could serve as a "trigger for certain actions" within Russia's elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. There is a growing sense that the desire and capabilities of certain groups within the elite for decisive actions could "grow significantly" and "move into some practical plane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

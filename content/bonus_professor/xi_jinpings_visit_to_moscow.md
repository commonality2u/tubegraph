Valery Solovey refers to [[russia_and_chinas_economic_agreements | The Kremlin]] awaiting its "older brother" [00:00:44], indicating the significance of [[impact_of_xi_jinpings_visit_to_moscow | Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow]] [00:06:46].

## Timing and Significance
The visit was scheduled to commence at noon on Monday, March 20 [00:06:55]. This event is considered pivotal as it is expected to genuinely influence both Russian domestic and potentially foreign policy [00:07:09]. The results of the visit are anticipated to be clear by late Tuesday evening [00:07:41]. [[russiachina_relations_and_influence | The Kremlin]] is described as being in a state of anticipation regarding the outcomes [00:07:35].

## Putin's State Ahead of the Visit
Prior to [[impact_of_xi_jinpings_visit_to_moscow | Xi Jinping's visit]], Russian President [[russian_political_dynamics_and_putins_public_appearances | Vladimir Putin]] was reportedly "not in very good physical shape" [00:07:48]. Efforts were made over the weekend to "bring him to his senses or to a more or less decent state" [00:07:54] to avoid appearing as a "weakling" [00:08:03] in front of [[impact_of_xi_jinpings_visit_to_moscow | Xi Jinping]] [00:08:00].

## China's Objectives
[[chinas_influence_on_russian_politics | China]] consistently pursues its own goals, not those of its "strategic partners" [00:08:27]. In relation to [[russian_delegation_visit_to_china | Russia]], [[chinas_influence_on_russian_politics | China's]] objective is to transform the [[russian_delegation_visit_to_china | Russian Federation]] and its spheres of influence to a degree where [[russian_delegation_visit_to_china | Russia]] becomes weak and "tied to China" [00:09:01]. A strong [[russian_delegation_visit_to_china | Russia]] is not in [[chinas_influence_on_russian_politics | China's]] interest; rather, it seeks a "weakened Russia" [00:09:05].

However, [[chinas_influence_on_russian_politics | China]] would not prefer an "absolute, complete defeat of Russia on the Ukrainian fronts" [00:09:12] as it would serve as a "bad sign for China itself" [00:09:20], demonstrating that autocracies might lose when confronting a "consolidated West" [00:09:28].

## Peace Initiative
It is considered unlikely that [[chinas_influence_on_russian_politics | China's]] peace initiative will succeed, as the US has repeatedly stated that [[chinas_influence_on_russian_politics | China's]] peace proposals are "unacceptable" [00:10:05]. The Ukrainian leadership and society also share this position [00:10:12].

## Potential Domestic Impact
The visit itself could act as a "trigger for certain actions" [00:14:03] within [[russian_political_dynamics_and_putins_public_appearances | Russia's]] elite. There is a growing sentiment that the desire and capabilities of influential figures within the elite to undertake "extremely decisive actions" [00:13:26] could significantly increase and transition into practical application, potentially spurred by the visit [00:14:03].

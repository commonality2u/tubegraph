The current [[political_and_economic_conditions_in_russia | political and economic conditions in Russia]] are characterized by the gradual impact of sanctions, internal elite conflicts, and a deteriorating financial system, with forecasts of significant changes and a challenging recovery period ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Impact and Survivability of Sanctions

The [[economic_and_political_landscape_of_russia | Russian political-economic system]] has endured despite "destructive terminal sanctions" imposed nearly three years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This survivability is attributed to several factors:
*   **Gradual Sanction Implementation** Sanctions were not imposed immediately but gradually, allowing the [[economic_conditions_in_russia | Russian economy]] and politics to adapt, similar to a frog being cooked slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Initially, sanctions were "not very pleasant" but not fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. However, the speaker now believes the "frog begins to die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Economic Safety Margin** The inherent safety margin of the [[economic_conditions_in_russia | Russian economy]] proved to be "much higher than expected" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Societal Patience** The "notorious and long-suffering people" of the [[russian_sociopolitical_dynamics | Russian Federation]] have shown significant patience, which has "more than once helped the authorities to go around all the problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. However, this patience is now "on the verge of exhaustion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Experts involved in the political "transit plan" do not primarily rely on public awakening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Political Dynamics and Elite Discontent

The process of approving the "transit plan" with specific names, dates, and roles has not yet been completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. The "revolutionary potential of the masses" is considered a secondary, background factor, not primary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Elite discontent, however, is significant and is driven by fundamental differences concerning the "future paths of development of Russia" and the "ideology of the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Existing contradictions within the "Putin model" are irreconcilable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

### Politburo 2.0 and Internal Power Struggles
The "Politburo 2.0" makes consensus decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. While the Chemezov group is believed to be superior to the Patrushev group, the latter's ability to push through "stupid financial and economic decisions," like raising interest rates, can be misunderstood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. The Chemezov group, which controls the economy, has prevented broader issues like mobilization and the use of tactical nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. Raising the interest rate is a decision that "everyone agrees needs to be done" given the current framework, as some decisions are now "uncontested" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. The current lack of choice in the economic sphere is a direct result of "previous actions of President Putin and those people who obediently carried out his... suicide and destructive decisions for the country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. The speaker states that the dead "Putin" is "holding the [[economic_conditions_and_government_policies_in_russia_under_putin | Russian economy]]" and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.

Dmitry Kozak, despite being one of the few who objected to the start of military action, has "no influence on the decision of the Politburo 2.0" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:46:57]</a>.

## Economic and Financial Stability

The financial and banking system is in a "catastrophic state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

### Deposit Freezing and Financial Measures
Freezing deposits and accounts is considered "uncontested" and the "only alternative" to fill "economic vessels with money blood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. While the speaker's team aims to soften the conditions of a freeze, it will happen regardless of who is in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   Pensions and salaries will continue to come to cards, with withdrawal and usage limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.
*   Brokerage accounts are expected to be frozen temporarily to prevent money transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. Russian shares will likely experience a significant downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.
*   Denomination of currency is not expected to be simultaneous with deposit freezing, occurring months or even a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. There is no immediate reason to exchange large banknotes for smaller ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.
*   Freezing deposits does not mean relief from mortgage or loan payments; banks will likely demand payment with greater force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>.
*   A "very serious crisis" of the real estate market and banking system is anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. While authorities don't want to completely collapse the real estate market, stagnation is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>.
*   Restrictions on payments for foreign nationals are being discussed, with models ranging from "relatively soft and humane to very, very tough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>.
*   If the government changes before summer as planned, a "vegetarian option for freezing deposits" will be chosen, minimizing suffering for the majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:03">[00:45:03]</a>. A tough, cruel scenario implemented before summer would cause widespread suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>.
*   A cash shortage for pension payments at post offices is a "real possibility," potentially worse than the 1990s when pensions and salaries were overdue for months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:59">[00:45:59]</a>.
*   Dollars in bank deposits will not be exempt from freezing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:33">[00:44:33]</a>. Automatic conversion to rubles at the Central Bank rate is not excluded, depending on the chosen freezing option and the severity of the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>.

### Sanction Lifting and Economic Recovery
The lifting of sanctions, or even the expectation of it, will have a positive effect on the [[the_economic_situation_in_russia_and_its_future_prospects | economic situation in Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>. However, sanctions will not be lifted immediately after a truce, even if a truce is concluded by early next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>. The process of lifting sanctions will take months, and some aspects years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:28">[00:42:28]</a>. The speaker emphasizes that recovering from the current state is not "easy and simple" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:45">[00:42:45]</a>.

## Military Course and Peace Prospects

*   Hawks would like to extend their "Carte Blanche" beyond December 15, potentially until January 20, but have not received consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. They will attempt to extend it and are "capable of literally everything," including provocations reminiscent of Russia's history 30 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   There is "very serious hope" that after December 15, the military course of the Russian Federation will gradually shift towards finding a peaceful solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Cautious, tangible steps towards peace are already being taken, including at the fronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   Stopping hostilities by the end of this year is unlikely (1-25% probability) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:24">[00:47:24]</a>.
*   Stopping hostilities by the end of January 2025 has a higher, but still low, probability (25-45%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>.
*   The possibility of returning the land corridor to Crimea to Ukraine by the end of 2025 is "higher than low" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>.
*   The military-industrial complex stands to benefit regardless of a truce, as it will need to replenish lost reserves and forge new equipment, not only in Russia but in all countries involved in the confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.
*   Achieving peace, even a truce, is crucial as it stops the killing of citizens and allows people to return home and begin peaceful life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>. A truce is the "beginning" of a path, and the ultimate outcome may be different from the initial agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.
*   Russian assets in Europe are considered "irretrievably lost" because mutual decisions have been made during consultations to use these assets for compensation to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>.

## Societal Changes and Justice

### Judicial and Legal Reforms
The new government plans a "corresponding legal reform" and a "complete, total lustration of the judicial corps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:38">[00:39:38]</a>. One of the first steps will be the release of all political prisoners and innocently convicted individuals, including those not necessarily under political articles, who will receive full rehabilitation, including financial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. A special agency will be created to deal with the "restoration of violated constitutional rights of Russian citizens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

### Accountability for Propagandists and Informers
Propagandists will be held criminally responsible, as their actions are classified under [[russian_criminal_law | Russian criminal law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. While extradition to an international tribunal in The Hague is possible, the speaker believes it's better for them to face "Basmanny justice," which is considered "much more unpleasant" and "much more dangerous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

For informers, a simple algorithm for punishment is proposed:
*   Their surnames, names, and patronymics will be published on official websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>.
*   They will face "moral ostracism" (e.g., people will stop greeting them, children will be told not to communicate with their children) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:23">[00:33:23]</a>.
*   If individuals suffered due to false denunciations (e.g., job loss, court cases), they have the right to go to court and are expected to win, with informers required to compensate material losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>.
*   The principled position is that "all informers" will be named <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>.

### Control and "Putin's Double"
The 67-year-old pediatrician Nadezhda Buyanova's "monstrous cruelty" of punishment is an attempt to "cause fear in Russian society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. The speaker states that "everyone knows" about these cases, and the goal of a group within the authorities is to induce fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

Regarding "Putin's double," the speaker asserts that the "whole world knows about it," and it's like a child playing hide-and-seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. He highlights that saying Putin is replaced by a double is "in no way persecuted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>. This situation is compared to the Time of Troubles with "false Dmitrys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>.

### Return of Exiles
Those who left Russia due to military action and the Putin regime will be able to return if they did not commit "real criminal offenses" (not those under Putin's system) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. The speaker is "absolutely sure that the overwhelming majority will return to Russia" because the "New Russia" will be fundamentally different, offering opportunities not available before or in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>.

## Outlook and Future Prospects

While political changes (change of power) are anticipated, socio-economic improvement will have "colossal inertia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. The first signs of economic recovery and improvement are expected "at the turn of the next year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>. Overcoming the crisis will require "at least 2 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. Indicators of progress will include the release of political prisoners and the cessation of blocking social networks like YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:59">[00:28:59]</a>.

For the first time in [[russian_internal_political_dynamics | Russian history]], the intra-elite dynamics have a chance to steer the country in a "positive direction" and act in the "interests of society and the country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>. The mechanism of change is expected to be similar to 16th-century "palace coups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>.

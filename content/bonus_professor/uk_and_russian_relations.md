The relationship between the United Kingdom and Russia, particularly from the perspective of the Kremlin, is characterized by deep-seated animosity and a perception of the UK as a primary adversary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Perceived UK Hostility Towards Russia

The Kremlin is said to deeply dislike the "Englishwoman" and the British <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. This hostility stems from several factors:
*   **Personal Reasons** There is an undisclosed, deeply personal reason for Russian President Vladimir Putin's animosity towards the British <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **KGB Legacy** Putin's background as a Soviet KGB officer contributes to this stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. The KGB traditionally cultivated hostility towards the British, viewing them as the primary competitors to Soviet intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. This ingrained animosity from the Soviet era has been extrapolated to the British political class and British politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **"Spearmen" of Intrigues** Britain is regarded by Russia as one of the key instigators ("spearmen") of serious intrigues against the [[Russian domestic political situation | Russian Federation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

## Boris Johnson's Resignation

The resignation of Boris Johnson as Prime Minister of Great Britain has a direct bearing on [[RussianUkrainian relations and military tensions | Russian-Ukrainian relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Great Britain is considered the main protagonist of the anti-Kremlin coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. While the continuity of Britain's foreign policy course is expected to be maintained, the personality of the leader and the transition period are significant factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. This leadership change led to quiet gloating within the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

## Contrasting with Germany

In contrast to the UK, Germany is seen as less committed to aiding Ukraine, evidenced by its perceived slowness in providing assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Germany has reportedly blocked the allocation of a 9 billion euro aid package from the [[European politics and relations with Russia | European Union]] for Ukraine for months, acting in what they perceive as their national interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. This stance highlights a divergence in approach within Western nations regarding the [[Discussion on Russian Ukrainian relations and conflict resolution | conflict in Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

Valery Solovyov discusses the [[issues_related_to_military_mobilization_and_its_impact | psychological reaction]] of some viewers and listeners to the news of a potential second wave of [[partial_mobilization_and_its_implications | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Public Reaction to News

Some viewers expressed that the news was a "nightmare," "terrible news," making it difficult to listen or fall asleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Solovyov ironically questions this reaction, asking if people can "live in Russia" and "sleep" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. He notes that his audience primarily consists of men over 35, suggesting they should possess "life experience" and "social maturity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Social Maturity and Accepting Truth

Solovyov defines social maturity as the ability to view things and events "sensibly and impartially," accepting reality without wishful thinking, no matter how unpleasant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. He describes the behavior of those who shield themselves from unpleasant truths as "infantile" or akin to teenagers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. He suggests that such individuals might prefer the "warm, cozy, at the same time exalted world" presented by central Russian television channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

He emphasizes addressing those who are willing to look at the world "sensibly and impartially" and, most importantly, "take responsibility for their behavior and their actions," rather than shifting it onto the state or others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Mobilization as a National Test

Solovyov views the attitude towards [[issues_related_to_military_mobilization_and_its_impact | mobilization]] as a "general national test" of intelligence and the "will to live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. He clarifies the "will to live" as distinct from the will to fight or the will to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

He argues that if one believes the homeland is genuinely threatened by an enemy or NATO, their duty is to fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. However, he critiques those who believe they can solve personal [[financial_implications_of_mobilization | financial issues]] or improve their situation through someone else's military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. He warns that such individuals should not complain about the loss of a breadwinner, as official documents may state the person "gave his life defending the homeland," and banks may not waive loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

## Survival Instinct and Will to Live

Receiving a summons for [[issues_related_to_military_mobilization_and_its_impact | mobilization]] and passively asking "what should we do" indicates a "weakened survival instinct" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. He states that those who want to live seek opportunities to survive and win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. He contrasts this with mothers sending their children to a foreign country "for no clear reason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>, describing this as a "lack of will to live" and a "slave of power" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

The speaker reiterates that the attitude towards [[issues_related_to_military_mobilization_and_its_impact | mobilization]] serves as a test of the ability to connect cause-and-effect and possess the will to live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. He encourages people to use their intelligence and will to survive, fighting for their "only life," as there will be no second chance or compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.

## Conclusion

Solovyov hopes his audience consists of "socially mature people" who can utilize their intellect and have a "drop of will to live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>. He advises listening to his message again if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. He acknowledges that he may have intensified concerns but stresses that mature individuals prepare for life's challenges rather than hiding from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.

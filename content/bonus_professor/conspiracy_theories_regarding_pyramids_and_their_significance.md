The current political and societal climate in Russia is marked by a pervasive interest in occultism, leading to the construction of pyramids and engagement in various mystical practices by the elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This trend is closely linked to the perceived health and longevity of Vladimir Putin, who is approaching his 68th birthday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, and the elite's desire to "domesticate" or "overcome" the fear surrounding his potential death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Pyramids in Modern Russia

A notable example of this phenomenon is the construction of a pyramid near Tomsk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This project is reportedly led by a group of businessmen, possibly connected to Prigozhin, and involves a United Russia deputy and other prominent businessmen from Tomsk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. The architect, Valery Uvarov, also designed the "Crystals and Lounge" spa and salon in St. Petersburg, whose owner is reportedly Prigozhin's spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. While a conspiracy theory links this pyramid to the poisoning of Navalny in Tomsk, the proliferation of "Egyptian" structures and occult interests among the Russian elite is considered very symptomatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Pyramids are now "molded in different places all over the country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

The selection of the Tomsk area for this pyramid is notable because, in the late 1980s, an archaeological expedition discovered a Late Bronze Age complex there, including disturbed graves with Egyptian cultural artifacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. These artifacts are believed to have arrived via well-developed trade routes of the era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

Another anecdote tells of a farmer in southern Russia who built a large pyramid on his field, claiming it cured his diseases, increased his cattle, and boosted crop yields, though he subsequently went bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## Interpretations and Beliefs

The purpose and significance of these modern pyramids are interpreted in two main ways:
*   **Tombs:** If viewed through the lens of the Egyptian pharaohs' era, pyramids are tombs, suggesting someone's desired resting place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Mystical Power:** According to "Russian black ideas about the pyramids," they are endowed with mystical power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. In this interpretation, the top of the pyramid would host the political subject, the middle level would be occupied by "shamans" (former Soviet-era party workers), and the bottom tier would feature figures like "Russian folk doctor Malakhov", associated with prolonging life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## Historical Context of Pyramids

### Egyptian Pyramids
There are two versions regarding Egyptian pyramids:
*   **Archaic Version:** The pharaohs of the Fourth Dynasty of the Ancient Kingdom built all pyramids, including the three great pyramids on the Giza plateau and the Sphinx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Modern Version:** Ancient Egyptian civilization built upon the ruins of an older civilization, to which the three great pyramids and the Sphinx are attributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Other pyramids are attributed to the pharaohs and were mostly built as tombs, though remarkably, the remains of pharaohs were never found in the three great pyramids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Step pyramids, built during the Third Dynasty, were never used for mystical rites in ancient Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

### Mesoamerican Pyramids
In Mesoamerica, step pyramids were indeed used for mystical rites, such as in the temple complexes of Palenque and Chichen Itza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## [[influence_of_occultism_on_political_figures | Occultism and Russian Political Figures]]

The increase in the occult component within the Russian government is linked to the desire to prolong life and gain "bonuses of the afterlife" directly for Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This trend is believed to be influenced by the leader's own choices and anxieties, inspiring imitation among the elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>.

### Putin's Alleged Occult Practices
Vladimir Putin is said to have engaged in non-Christian rites for his health and to "induct damage and evil oil" on his enemies with a certain elder Nikifor, a pseudonym for a "Valdai elder" living near Novospassky monastery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. These rituals are explicitly stated to have "nothing to do with Christianity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

Early in his management, Putin reportedly consulted three fortune-tellers, two of whom were outside Russia and unaware of the client's identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. All three gave "almost identical predictions," stating he would rule for 20 years, but his reign's end would be "terrible if he cannot change the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. These predictions, though allegorical, were seen as easily readable, with references to Georgia, Ukraine, and other real-world changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. The predictions were delivered without the final paragraph, which reportedly warned, "all twelve turn away from you and then I will choose the king be afraid of part of the southern ruler of poisons husband of the state southern ruler head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>, interpreted as referring to figures like Milosevic, Mubarak, and Gaddafi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. This belief in prophecies and fate is seen as a "driver of real Russian politics and foreign policy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

### The Elite's Behavior and Fears
The Russian elite perceives these events through the "Thomas theorem" â€“ "it's important how it is perceived by those people who turned to predictions and who became guided by these predictions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. They feel an "esoteric fear" combined with the leader's "fading age" and "exhaustion of his luck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. Since August 2020, following events in Belarus, communication with Putin has become extremely limited, causing "extreme nervousness and very anxious... panic or semi-panic" among those formerly close to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. The elite, who once had an "almost mystical belief in Putin's luck," now say that "luck is lost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

This situation has led to a widespread "demand for a miracle" within the Russian establishment, as they feel conventional political and economic instruments are failing to change reality, except for repression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>. They are turning to "magical instruments" hoping to "conjure this reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>.

### [[role_of_mysticism_and_esotericism_in_the_kremlin | Mysticism and Esotericism in the Kremlin]]
The prevalence of mystical, quasi-esoteric, and pseudo-occult moods in Russia is significantly worse than during the end of the Russian Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a>. Nearly all groups within the establishment are affected, with each having its own "fashion or ... passion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>. Trends have shifted from seeking Shambhala to consulting Orthodox elders, then shamans from different regions, and now even "fashionable fortune tellers on tarot cards" and astrologers in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>. This "sharp demand for esotericism [and] occultism has been growing precisely since two thousand and fourteen [or] fifteen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.

The elite's pursuit of occult solutions is characterized by:
*   **Imitation:** Many strive to imitate the "first overlord," Putin, who sets the fashion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.
*   **Commercialization:** This creates a booming market for "quasi-occult and pseudo-esoteric services," attracting both charlatans and their suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>. Supplying "magicians from the Amazon delta with supposedly ayahuasca" is a business where intermediaries earn hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>. These intermediaries prepare magicians to tell clients what they want to hear, leading to "biased confirmation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.
*   **Belief in Secret Forces:** Almost half of the Russian population, including nearly all FSB officers and a significant portion of the financial elite, believe in a "world government" or secret "chanceries" that rule the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>. They seek a "pass to this government" or an "omnipotence ring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>. This reflects a worldview similar to Pelevin's novels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>.
*   **Group Identity:** Engagement in these practices serves as a form of "team building" and "group identity" within the elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>. Skepticism or atheism is seen as "unfashionable" and "a loss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>.

### [[interplay_of_religion_and_occult_practices | Interplay of Religion and Occult Practices]]
While Putin attends Russian Orthodox Church events, these are primarily seen as "protocol events" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>. The elite generally perceives Christianity not as a "religion of the spirit" but as a "religion of the flesh," treating its mystical elements as separate, independent miracles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. They do not reject the power of human remains, which have been exploited by religious cults since ancient times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. This leads to practices like the acquisition of relics, such as a supposed skeleton of a "Byzantine king," intended for an altar of Santa Muerte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.

Santa Muerte is a syncretic Mexican cult combining elements of Christianity and traditional Mexican beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>. Its altars require a skeleton or skull, ideally from a "powerful person," as a fool's remains would yield foolish results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. This cult has varieties for career growth ("black death"), wealth ("golden death"), and worldly goods like love ("white death") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>. The elite pays "a lot of money" for such relics, with amounts like $250,000-$300,000 considered "ridiculous" for the "most important attribute [of a] miracle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>.

### Occult Orders and Their Influence
Contact with "13 great world occult orders" has not existed for a long time in Russia due to "insurmountable contradictions" stemming from a perceived "unsuccessful joke" by Russian leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>. These orders, structured with political, economic, scientific, and metaphysical components, value freedom, enlightenment, and uncensored knowledge, which are rejected by the Russian establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>.

Despite the lack of direct contact, these non-public organizations (which include "adherents supporters" in the Russian government and Western governments) exert significant [[sociopolitical_implications_of_occult_beliefs | political influence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>. They are credited with sensitive "slaps on the nose" received by the Russian government, influencing Western media campaigns and leaders' tough stances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>. Unlike public organizations, these non-public bodies operate in informal settings, such as "closed clubs" in Moscow where oligarchs and ministers meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>. They believe in free will and do not manipulate, but rather influence by informing choices within the framework of awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.

The widespread belief in a "world government" among the elite means they "cannot believe in the chaos of the disorder of the world," instead believing there is a secret "chancery" that rules it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>.

## Current State and Outlook
The current "turbulence" in Russia has led to a great demand for miracles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>. The Russian establishment "is thirsty for a miracle" for Putin to leave while everything remains the same, and for Putin himself to "outwit history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>. However, there's a growing sense that this is impossible, and a "fatal line" is being approached where everything "will collapse very quickly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>. This creates a "feeling of fear" among the establishment, a "deep nothing" where they don't understand where threats will come from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>. The situation is likened to a "new Middle Ages," where people poison each other, and the government engages in "dense [[historical_and_contemporary_perspectives_on_black_magic | black magic]] rituals" and "worships the remains of the dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. This "new Middle Ages" is predicted to be a "very short period" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>.

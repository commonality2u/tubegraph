Russia's economy is [[economic_challenges_in_russia | critically dependent on oil prices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:35">[03:12:35]</a>. This reliance means that the state budget and its ability to fund social and economic measures are directly tied to the fluctuating cost of oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:52">[03:14:52]</a>.

## Budget and Reserves
While official figures suggest Russia possesses sufficient gold and foreign exchange reserves, as well as a National Welfare Fund, to support society and small to medium-sized businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:54">[02:53:54]</a>, these are estimates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:47">[03:09:47]</a>. According to some government assessments, if the status quo is maintained, these funds would only last until October or November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

## Impact of Low Oil Prices
The sharp drop in oil prices directly affects Russia's budget revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. This has led to discussions about limiting expenses and even intentionally lowering the ruble exchange rate to 100 per dollar to compensate for lost income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. While Vladimir Putin has reportedly held back this measure, it has been persistently offered to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

Even at prices of $25 per barrel, Russia could "make ends meet" if it changed its management, stopped large-scale corruption, and refused a number of non-core expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:43:00">[18:43:00]</a>.

## The OPEC+ Deal
The decision by Russia to withdraw from the OPEC+ deal was made by President Putin himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>. The manner of refusal was described as "completely offensive" to Saudi Arabia and other OPEC participants, leading to a strong personal conflict between Putin and the Saudi Crown Prince <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>. The Crown Prince reportedly refused to speak with Putin on the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>.

It is also alleged that the Saudis received information that the Kremlin was involved in the scandal surrounding Jamal Khashoggi, influencing the distribution and replication of information through agents and media in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>. The perceived logic behind this was to provoke sanctions against Saudi Arabia, forcing them into Russia's arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>. This action allegedly led to an oath of revenge at a Saudi family meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:07]</a>.

Ultimately, Russia found itself in a difficult position, forcing it to seek U.S. intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:00">[15:39:00]</a>. The US, led by President Trump, leveraged this situation, demanding concessions in exchange for helping influence the Saudi Crown Prince to agree to a new oil deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a>. One such demand was Russia's withdrawal from Venezuela <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[16:32:00]</a>. This suggests that while Trump gained leverage, both Saudi Arabia and Russia lost in this scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a>. Russia is currently in a state where the Kremlin is "ready to agree to everything" regarding oil production reductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:39:00">[18:39:00]</a>.

## Long-term Outlook
For high oil prices, global economic growth is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:19:00">[19:19:00]</a>. However, it is predicted that there will likely be economic falls, making it improbable for oil prices to rise to Russia's desired level of $40 per barrel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:31:00">[19:31:00]</a>. Experts predict that oil prices will remain in a low range not only for the current year but for a significant portion of the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a>.

This economic situation, coupled with other factors, is contributing to a rapid collapse of Russia's political and state structure, which has been in place for the last 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:49:00">[33:49:00]</a>. The authorities may soon be more concerned with their own survival and confronting internal [[russian_political_and_economic_stability | political challenges]] than with the [[impact_of_economic_sanctions_on_russia | lifting of sanctions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:03:00">[34:03:00]</a>.

The program "What is Happening" discussed [[Putins strategy and plans regarding Ukraine | Putin's plans for military victory and his notions of victory]] in the ongoing conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Putin's Strategy and Response to Ukraine
According to the speaker, [[russian_political_and_military_strategies | Russia's military strategy]] involves concentrating forces for a decisive battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Russia's response to Ukraine's strategic offensive preparations includes:
*   Striking Ukraine's energy system to cause disorganization, demoralization, and a new wave of emigration towards European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   Expecting new weapons systems from Iran, specifically ballistic missiles, with a first batch possibly transferred before the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Russia and Iran are expected to deny this to worldwide publicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   Intensive use of [[political_address_and_military_mobilization_measures_in_russia | mobilization]] and concentration of manpower, a strategy reminiscent of the mid-20th century, despite Russia's current lower demographic potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. The Kremlin believes that a quantitative advantage is necessary to achieve victory or honorable peace terms with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

### Planned Mobilization Measures
A new stage of [[political_address_and_military_mobilization_measures_in_russia | mobilization]] is anticipated shortly after the New Year holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This will likely involve:
*   A partial or complete closure of borders for those in the mobilization base, which is presumed to include around 7 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
*   A target of 2 million mobilized individuals, including 300,000 women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   Limited movement between subjects of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   Intensive use of the Guard, police, and DZOV workers to detect, identify, and escort mobilized personnel to collection points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   Mobilized individuals will be sent almost immediately to the front line or line of contact without preliminary training due to a lack of organizational and technical capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   Sociological data suggests that while people dislike [[political_address_and_military_mobilization_measures_in_russia | mobilization]], they are resigned to it and will comply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   Yevgeny Prigozhin proposed using prisoners from both men's and women's colonies for military conditions, including assault squads, to "wash away their guilt with blood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   Rumors suggest attempts to attract patients from neuropsychiatric dispensaries to participate in the construction of the "Surovikin line," a defensive line intended to halt a Ukrainian strategic offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

## Putin's Vision of Victory
[[Putins strategy and plans regarding Ukraine | Putin]] plans for a victorious completion of the "special military operation" no later than mid-summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
*   This plan was reportedly provided to the Chinese side as a condition for a visit to Moscow or telephone conversations with [[Putins leadership and political influence | Putin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
*   [[Putins leadership and political influence | Putin]] maintains confidence and has no doubts about the final victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
*   "Victory" implies the acquisition or control of new territories and an exit to peace negotiations, potentially a truce, ceasefire, or even a peace treaty by mid-summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. The speaker views this as "extremely dubious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

### Evolving Goals of the "Special Military Operation"
Initially, [[Putins strategy and plans regarding Ukraine | Putin]] stated the goals of "demilitarization" and "denazification" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.
*   [[Putins leadership and political influence | Putin]] has partially claimed that demilitarization has been achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.
*   A new, more globalist goal has emerged: "the unification of the Russian people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. This goal sounds "fantastic" and "counterproductive" to the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.
*   The speaker refutes the idea of a triune people (Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians), stating they are distinct peoples despite close ethnic, cultural, linguistic, and historical ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.
*   It is argued that [[Putins leadership and political influence | Putin's]] actions have pushed away ethnic groups who once viewed Russia favorably, causing them to flee from Russia "like from a leper country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.
*   The notion of "unification in love" brought by missiles and artillery shells is presented sarcastically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>.

The speaker concludes that [[Putins leadership and political influence | Putin]] has pulled Russia into a "strategic trap" called Ukraine, and everyone will have to pay the consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

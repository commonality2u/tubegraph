The [[current_political_climate_and_leadership_in_russia | current political climate in Russia]] and its leadership's actions are characterized by an increasing detachment from public sentiment, preparation for further military escalation, and a perceived disregard for the well-being of the populace.

## Putin's Disconnect and Theatricality
A significant reputational event was President Putin's meeting with mothers, widows, and wives of Russian servicemen participating in the special military operation in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This meeting was widely criticized for its "deliberately theatrical nature" and "lowest quality theatricality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Despite "colossal resources" from the presidential administration, the event was poorly organized, making its staged nature evident even to an "undemanding viewer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

A particularly concerning statement from Putin was his casual remark, "And what would have been better if they had died from vodka or died in an accident?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This phrase, according to the speaker, reveals a "complete lack of empathy" in the [[russian_political_dynamics_and_leadership_issues | Russian president]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, despite "hundreds of thousands of millions of people" suffering and making sacrifices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This perspective is interpreted as an embodiment of Freud's concept of Thanatos, the desire for death and destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. The speaker asserts that when Putin speaks of dying "for the Motherland," he actually means dying "for me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. This worldview suggests the primary objective for those involved in the conflict is "to die for Putin, not to live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Inevitable Mobilization and Official Denials
The military conflict is expected to intensify, with Ukrainian armed forces holding the strategic initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. A new Ukrainian offensive is deemed "inevitable" as Ukraine continues to receive necessary weapons and prepares new units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Recognizing this, the [[russian_political_dynamics_and_leadership_issues | Russian leadership]] requires a new stage of mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

Signs of this impending mobilization include a presidential decree on the creation of an integrated database of military personnel, set to be fully ready by April 2024, with digitization of military registration data to be completed by December 25 of the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This timeline aligns with previous predictions of a second stage of mobilization and martial law after the winter holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

Another indicator is the "speech in Russia" phenomenon, where official denials signify preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. When Kremlin spokesman Peskov or President Putin himself deny discussions of a second mobilization wave, it implies the decision has already been made and is awaiting execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The speaker highlights Putin's past denials regarding retirement age, constitutional changes, and the possibility of armed confrontation with Ukraine as precedents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. These denials are considered "one of the best indirect evidence of existing plans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## Deteriorating International Image and Belarusian Relations
The [[russian_political_landscape_and_potential_changes | image of Russia]] on the international stage continues to suffer. The DKB summit, attended by Putin, was marked by Armenian Prime Minister Pashinyan's refusal to sign the final declaration, signaling Armenia's potential withdrawal from the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

Photographs from the summit notably show a greater distance between Putin and other leaders compared to the distance among other participants, suggesting they are "avoiding the president" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. This physical distancing followed the European Parliament's resolution designating Russia as a "terrorist state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Although this resolution lacks immediate practical consequences, it significantly impacts Russia's reputation, as other leaders fear reputational and economic repercussions (e.g., sanctions) from being associated with the leader of a "declared terrorist state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This "instinctive reaction" demonstrates a noticeable shift even among countries previously considered "loyal vassals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

The sudden death of Vladimir Makei, Belarus's Minister of Foreign Affairs, allegedly from a heart attack, is regarded as a "tragic event" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Reliable sources indicate it was a "murder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Makei was reportedly killed for being a "too successful negotiator" in establishing communication and potentially restoring relations between Belarus and Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. During these negotiations, Belarus hinted at future political concessions and changes in Russia that would allow Belarus to move towards democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Makei's murder served to "block" this diplomatic track and send a "black mark" or "hint" to Belarusian President Lukashenko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. This event suggests a warning to those considering "refusing close brotherly embraces" with [[russian_political_dynamics_and_leadership_issues | Russian leadership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

## Public Mood and Economic Reality
Sociological surveys present a contradictory picture of the [[russian_domestic_political_situation | Russian public mood]]. While some polls show a high and growing level of optimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, others indicate a rise in anxious moods, with the level of anxiety growing from 49% to 56% in a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. This "schizophrenia of consciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a> can be explained by different information sources and socially approved answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

For optimists, television remains the key source of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, presenting a "rich, prosperous Russia" that overcomes difficulties and moves towards "complete final Victory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. However, this narrative also "pumps up psychosis" by emphasizing pervasive enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

Recent surveys show a shift in trust away from television. An October survey in cities with populations over 100,000 found that 48% trust Internet media, 45% trust social networks/Telegram channels, and only 36% trust television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. This contrasts with an August Levada Center poll, which placed television at 51% trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. This discrepancy is attributed to the urban focus of the recent poll and the impact of the Ukrainian counteroffensive and partial mobilization, which increased "fear and anxiety" in Russian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. While behavioral changes are not yet evident, there is a growing "disgust" for propaganda, potentially leading to "hatred" and "complete denial" of official sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

Economically, the average Russian household's expenses on food and everyday goods reached nearly 48% of their budget in October, a 6.5% increase from the previous year and a record high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. This means almost half of a family's income is spent on "existing" or "surviving," leaving much less for entertainment, medical treatment, or self-investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. The speaker describes this as a "slave state," where people "work only to eat" and "pay off a mortgage," essentially to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. The choice offered to a Russian person is "Live as a slave and die for the [[russian_political_dynamics_and_leadership_issues | Russian president]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>, a "monstrous" reality that many fear to acknowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.

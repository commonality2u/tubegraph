Valery Solovyov, a doctor of historical sciences, political analyst, and public figure, discussed the [[ukraine_russia_conflict | armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine]] on his YouTube channel on April 18, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. He noted that despite his background in politics, ideology, and culture, the conflict had become the main focus of Russian politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Approaching the Culmination

The speaker stated that the armed confrontation appeared to be approaching its culmination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Reasons for Culmination

*   **Russian Perspective:**
    *   The Kremlin had not achieved any of its combat missions or political goals set at the beginning of its campaign against Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
    *   The death of the cruiser Varyag was not publicly explained, with only "vague hints" given, and no mourning declared, which left a "painful impression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
    *   The effectiveness of the "limited special military operation" was called into question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
    *   The Russian leadership needed a [[strategic_turning_point_in_russia_ukraine_conflict | strategic turning point]] on the fronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Ukrainian Perspective:**
    *   Ukraine, supported by the West, did not intend to meet Russia's "ultimatum demands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
    *   The West publicly stated that the fate of peace talks would be decided on the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
    *   Ukraine believed it was capable of inflicting "significant damage" on Russia on the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Symptoms of Culmination

*   Russian troops were concentrating in Donbass with the aim of creating a "cauldron" for Ukraine's armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   The West was rapidly supplying Ukraine with complex and strike weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   The upcoming "Battle of Donbass" was considered by all parties, including those not formally involved, to be the "key event of the confrontation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## Escalation Risks

The confrontation was expected to be "extremely fierce," with "all the symptoms of bitterness" evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Information from senior Russian military sources indicated a lack of confidence in victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The risk of [[potential_escalation_of_military_conflict_between_russia_and_ukraine | escalation]] was very high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

### Potential Escalation Mechanisms

1.  **Use of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD):**
    *   If the Kremlin's combat and political goals (forcing Ukraine to sign a favorable peace treaty) were not achieved, or if the Russian army failed to achieve a [[strategic_turning_point_in_russia_ukraine_conflict | strategic turning point]], the risks of using WMD, including low-yield tactical nuclear weapons, would increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
    *   The possibility of using tactical nuclear weapons was constantly discussed regarding the situation in Donbass and Ukraine, confirmed by Western sources including American military and intelligence (e.g., the head of the CIA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
    *   WMD also includes chemical and bacteriological weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. Russian and self-proclaimed republics' defense ministries hinted that Ukrainians might commit provocations or possess chemical weapons, interpreted as "transparent hints" of a potential escalation mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
    *   There was a temptation to interrupt Western arms supply chains to Ukraine, possibly through strikes with tactical nuclear weapons on Ukrainian territory or neighboring countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
2.  **Strikes on Russian Territory:**
    *   The opposing side might strike military and civilian targets in Russian regions adjacent to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
    *   Ukraine was expected to receive missiles capable of reaching Russian military airfields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
3.  **Terrorist Attacks in Russia:**
    *   Terrorist attacks in Moscow and other large Russian cities could be another trigger for escalation, with "vague hints" seen in official Russian media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

The world was described as being in a situation "very close, very reminiscent of the Cuban Missile Crisis," possibly "even more acute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## Possible Outcomes

Assuming the most dangerous escalation is avoided, three possibilities for further developments were outlined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>:

1.  **Peace Treaty:** This was seen as "not a very big possibility now" due to the irreconcilable demands of both the Ukrainian and Russian sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
2.  **Truce:** A cessation of hostilities, either partial or full <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
3.  **Continuation of Positional Battles:** This could happen under the guise of a truce or without an announcement, taking the form of ongoing "sluggish military actions" after the expected military culmination in April <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. This state could last until at least the fall of 2022, or possibly longer, according to American sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

## Internal Russian Dynamics

The failure to implement the "initial concept of a limited military operation" was blamed on subordinates, not the "boss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

*   **Accountability:**
    *   People close to the president, who provided information or instilled confidence that Ukraine would collapse, were blamed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
    *   Minister of Defense Shuryga had "fallen into disgrace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
    *   The former head of the 5th Service of the FSB, responsible for operational information on Ukraine and behind-the-scenes preparation, was in a pre-trial detention center and reportedly subjected to "physical abuse." A group of officers from his department were also giving confessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
    *   Problems also existed within the Main Directorate of the General Staff (military intelligence) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
*   **No Conspiracy, but Disorganization:**
    *   The speaker refuted constant reports of a conspiracy against Putin or a split in the elite, stating "there is nothing like that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.
    *   Instead, there was "tension and disorganization" among the security forces, which was expected to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
    *   A "purge" was anticipated once the special military operation concluded, with "culprits" named and punished in the "Russian manner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
*   **Impact on Bureaucracy and Big Business:**
    *   Tension and disorganization would also increase among the top bureaucracy and big business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.
    *   Reasons included the impending purge, strengthening Western sanctions that would be "more and more sensitive" and difficult for the Russian economy, leading to "technological degradation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.
    *   Conversations had revived among the security environment about the nationalization of large private assets, as assets of Russian oligarchs in the West were being seized and not expected to be returned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.
*   **"Dukhatization" and the End of an Era:**
    *   Barely noticeable signs of "dukhatization" (a term implying decline or demoralization) were observed among the security forces, with fears and confusion among the highest elites who did not know how to exit the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.
    *   The situation was compared to the Russian Empire leading up to the First World War, where "dukhatization" took three years; now, this path might be covered "much faster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.
    *   While the structure of the Russian government was not yet crumbling, there was a mass feeling of "exhaustion of that historical time" called the "Putin era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. This era was coming to an end, likely not triumphantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.

On April 18, 2022, the [[ongoing_armed_confrontation_between_russia_and_ukraine | armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine]] was identified as the main nerve of Russian politics, requiring political analysis to focus on it as the dominant factor in what is happening and will happen in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Approaching the Culmination of Confrontation

The speaker suggests that the [[ongoing_armed_confrontation_between_russia_and_ukraine | armed confrontation]] is approaching its culmination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Reasons for Approaching Culmination

From the Russian side, the Kremlin has not achieved its initial combat missions or political goals set at the beginning of the campaign against Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The death of the cruiser Varyag has not been publicly explained, no number of dead has been named, and mourning has not been declared, which creates a painful impression and calls into question the effectiveness of the "limited special military operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The Russian leadership is perceived to need a strategic turning point on the fronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

On the Ukrainian side, Ukraine, supported by the West, does not intend to meet Russia's ultimatum demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The West has publicly stated that the fate of peace talks will be decided on the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, and Ukraine believes it is capable of inflicting significant damage on Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Symptoms of Culmination

*   Russian troops are concentrating in Donbass with the aim of creating a "cauldron" for the armed forces of Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   The West is rapidly sending complex and strike weapons to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   The Battle of Donbass is considered the key event of the [[ongoing_armed_confrontation_between_russia_and_ukraine | armed confrontation between Russia and Ukraine]] by all parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   Information from senior Russian military indicates a lack of confidence in victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

## Escalation Risks

The confrontation is expected to be extremely fierce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, and the risk of [[escalation_of_military_action_between_russia_and_ukraine | escalation]] is very high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

### Potential for Weapons of Mass Destruction

If the Kremlin cannot achieve its combat missions or political goals—specifically, forcing Ukraine to sign peace on favorable terms—the risks of using weapons of mass destruction, including low-yield tactical nuclear weapons, increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. The possibility of using tactical nuclear weapons is constantly discussed regarding the situation in Donbass and Ukraine in general, confirmed by Western sources, including the American military and intelligence (e.g., the head of the CIA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

Weapons of mass destruction also imply chemical and bacteriological weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Representatives of the Russian Ministry of Defense and self-proclaimed republics hint that Ukrainians will commit provocations against civilians or possess chemical weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. These "transparent hints" suggest a potential [[escalation_of_military_action_between_russia_and_ukraine | escalation]] mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

### Interrupting Supply Chains

The Russian leadership understands that Ukraine's effective resistance is largely due to advanced weapons supplies from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. There is a temptation to interrupt these logistical chains of arms supplies, potentially with tactical nuclear weapons, targeting either Ukrainian territory or a neighboring country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Discussion on this is ongoing in the West, though no decision has been made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

### Other Escalation Triggers

*   The Ukrainian side potentially striking military and civilian targets on the territory of the Russian Federation or adjacent Russian regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Ukraine is expected to receive missiles capable of reaching Russian military airfields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   Terrorist attacks in Moscow and other large Russian cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, hinted at in Russian official and social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

The world is in a situation reminiscent of the Cuban Missile Crisis, perhaps even more acute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## Possible Outcomes

If the most dangerous option of large-scale self-destruction is avoided, three possibilities for further developments exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>:

1.  **Peace Treaty**: Based on the positions of both sides, particularly Russia's "unrealizable" demands, a peace treaty is considered a remote possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
2.  **Truce**: A cessation of hostilities, either partial or full <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
3.  **Continuation under Truce**: A truce combined with sluggish positional battles, potentially lasting until the fall of 2022 or even until the end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

## Internal Russian Dynamics

### Blame and Purges

The failure of the initial concept of a "limited military operation" is blamed on individuals close to the president who provided information or instilled confidence that Ukraine would collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Those reportedly facing consequences include:

*   Minister of Defense Shuryga, who fell into disgrace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
*   The former head of the 5th Service of the FSB (responsible for operational information on Ukraine and behind-the-scenes preparation), who is in a pre-trial detention center and allegedly subjected to physical abuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. A group of officers from his department are also giving confessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
*   Problems also exist in the Main Directorate of the General Staff (former GRU), which is military intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

There is no conspiracy against Putin or split in the elite, but rather tension and disorganization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. This tension and disorganization among security forces will increase, as a "purge" is expected once the special military operation ends, with culprits to be named and punished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

### Impact on Bureaucracy and Business

Tension and disorganization will also increase among top bureaucracy and big business due to:

*   The impending purge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
*   Strengthening sanctions from the West, which will become more sensitive and difficult for the Russian economy, leading to technological degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
*   The confiscation of Russian oligarchs' assets abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.
*   Revived discussions within the Russian security environment about nationalizing large assets of private corporations and firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

## Signs of De-Cossackization

The situation shows barely noticeable signs of "de-Cossackization" (fear, confusion) within the security forces and among the highest elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. The elites do not know how to exit the situation and anticipate it worsening, likely leading to a "very sad outcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

This process is compared to the Russian Empire's experience in World War I, where "de-Cossackization" took three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. The current path is expected to be much faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. While authorities are attempting to prevent this by "tightening the screws," the speaker suggests that a rusty structure will crumble if screws are tightened too much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

There is a mass feeling that the "Putin era" is nearing its end, and this end is unlikely to be triumphant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

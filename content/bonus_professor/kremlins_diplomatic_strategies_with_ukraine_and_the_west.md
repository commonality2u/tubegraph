As of May 15, the Kremlin has not been able to achieve a military turning point in its favor in the special military operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Chances of achieving this strategic turning point without using "extremely potent means" are decreasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This situation presents the Kremlin with a dilemma: continue actions without significant success or try to negotiate with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Diplomatic Overtures to the West

To influence Ukraine into negotiations, the Kremlin believes it must go through the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The Kremlin is sending both overt and covert signals to the West regarding its desired negotiation conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. From the Kremlin's perspective, these initial goals for a peace treaty look almost minimal, though not from the perspective of Ukraine or the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

The [[peace_negotiations_and_kremlins_perspective | Kremlin's conditions for a peace treaty]] are formulated as follows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>:
*   Complete control of Donbas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   Ukraine's recognition of Crimea as Russian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   Donbas to be independent or part of Russia in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   A land corridor to Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### Western Reactions to Kremlin's Proposals

An overt attempt at communication was a conversation between Russian Defense Minister Shoigu and US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, the first since February 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This conversation was initiated by Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The West's overall response to these requests has been more negative than positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

There is a noticeable difference in positions within the West:
*   **France and Germany**: These nations would not mind if Russia and Ukraine agreed on such conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. French President Macron, for example, offered Ukrainian President Zelensky to make territorial concessions to Russia to achieve a peace treaty, which Zelensky refused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Germany also demonstrates a similar stance by delaying weapon supplies to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Anglo-Saxon bloc**: This group, including Great Britain, the United States, Poland, and the Baltic countries, advocates for the war to continue "to a victorious end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Ukraine shares this position, aiming to achieve decisive success and completely regain all its territory, not just restore the status quo antebellum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

The collective West would ideally like a peace treaty concluded as soon as possible to avoid a continuation of the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. However, the Kremlin and Putin cannot leave empty-handed, as this would mean admitting defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. The Russian ambassador to Washington stated there would be "no Moscow's capitulation in Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. The West has made it clear to Putin that it is not interested in expanding the conflict territorially or escalating it to a qualitatively new level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## Russia's Internal Context and "Diplomacy"

With Ukraine reportedly ready to mobilize up to a million people and preparing a counteroffensive to fully return its territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, Russia is left with two main instruments: mobilization and the use of qualitatively new, non-conventional weapons (weapons of mass destruction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Hidden mobilization is already underway in Russia, drawing from the reserve created in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

In the absence of military successes, the Russian Ministry of Defense disseminates sensational news to occupy the information space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Examples include:
*   An announcement of an attempt to infect LPR residents with tuberculosis via fake bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. This is likened to Soviet-era rumors about Americans poisoning chewing gum and cigarettes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   A report on the Pentagon's experiments in a psychiatric hospital in the Kharkiv region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   Previous news about Ukrainian secret laboratories developing dangerous disease strains and studying migratory bird routes to spread them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

These types of news are launched loudly but then die out, serving to fill the information void in the absence of genuine positive developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

Economically, the Russian president recently claimed that Russia is successfully overcoming sanctions, that sanctions are to their advantage, and that the ruble is demonstrating the best dynamics globally, while the West faces problems of unemployment, inflation, and falling GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. This is presented as an injection of optimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

However, behind this optimism, Bloomberg reports that Russia's Ministry of Finance forecasts a GDP fall of 12%, and under a pessimistic scenario over two years, the decline could reach 25% if Russia's isolation from world oil markets is successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. This would be the most significant decline in 94 years, wiping out all economic achievements of the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. Car sales in Russia collapsed by almost 80% in April <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>, and there's a threat of unemployment with many companies beginning mass layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

To compensate for the deteriorating social situation and declining incomes, the government promotes patriotism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. This includes introducing history lessons from the first grade and restoring the All-Union Pioneer Organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. The more talk about patriotism and calls for patience, the worse the real state of affairs in the country is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. This "state-owned" patriotism often causes rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

The Kremlin's strategy appears to be one of attempting to control the narrative internally while sending signals for negotiation externally, all while facing significant internal and external pressures. This aligns with broader [[Kremlin's foreign policy and decisionmaking | Kremlin's foreign policy and decision-making]].

According to Valery Solovyov, a second wave of [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization]] in Russia is highly probable and will constitute an escalation of military action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This [[resumption_of_mobilization_in_russia | resumption of mobilization]] is anticipated after Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly abandoned the idea of peace negotiations with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Expected Timeline and Scope

The [[second_stage_of_mobilization_in_russia | second stage of mobilization]] is expected to be announced with very high probability after the New Year holidays, likely in mid-January <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. While some suggest it could begin as early as December, simultaneous with the draft, January is considered more likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This phase is projected to be more comprehensive than the first stage, possibly under the concept of a "people's war" proposed by Kiriyenko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. It will include categories of individuals not subject to the initial [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. From the authorities' perspective, the first stage was successful, as people "meekly" reported to [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization]] points and then to the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Associated Measures

In conjunction with the [[second_stage_of_mobilization_in_russia | second stage of mobilization]], other significant measures are expected:
*   **Introduction and Expansion of Martial Law** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>: Currently applied only to the so-called "new territories," martial law is anticipated to be expanded to other areas of the Russian Federation, including the capital and major cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. The exact timing for this expansion remains open and will depend on the evolving situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Restrictions on Civil Liberties and Rights** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>:
    *   **Travel Restrictions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>: Travel outside the Russian Federation will likely be limited for those included in the "mobilized base," which could number around seven million people, including women with specific military registration specialties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. In some cases, restrictions on movement between regions might also be imposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
    *   **Detention without Charge** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>: Under martial law, individuals can be detained, or interned, without charges for 30 days, with potential for indefinite extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
    *   **Requisitioning of Property** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>: Military-civilian authorities may gain the right to requisition premises, transport, and other necessities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
    *   **Curfew and Establishment Restrictions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>: Authorities could impose curfews and restrictions on the operation of cultural, educational, and entertainment establishments, similar to pandemic measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

## Advice for Citizens

Given these prospects, individuals are advised to formulate a survival strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. For those of draft or potentially [[mobilization_and_military_policies_in_russia | mobilization]] age, or their family members, the key question is whether they wish to end up in the trenches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.

Key recommendations include:
*   **Leaving Russia** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>: If resources allow, leaving the country is recommended. It is advised to leave before the [[second_stage_of_mobilization_in_russia | second stage of mobilization]] begins, as departure may become impossible afterwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>.
*   **Internal Relocation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>: If leaving Russia is not an option, consider moving within Russia to a safer location, despite potential inconveniences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.
*   **Acquiring Weapons (Legally)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>: If possible, legally acquire weapons.
*   **Community Interaction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>: Coordinate with neighbors (in the entrance, stairwell, house, or yard) for forms of mutual interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.
*   **For Minors/Students** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>:
    *   Enroll in higher education institutions that provide state accreditation and deferment from conscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.
    *   If unable to study, find a place to "sit out" the difficult months, starting the search now, or after the New Year for minors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>.
    *   If there's an opportunity to go abroad and sustain oneself, leave now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.

Ultimately, individuals should act in accordance with their values, prioritizing their own life and the lives of their family and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>. Young families are especially encouraged to make this existential choice for life and freedom, rather than risking death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>.

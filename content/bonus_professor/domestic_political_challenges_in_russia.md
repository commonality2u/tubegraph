The [[internal_political_situation_in_russia | internal political situation in Russia]] is currently characterized by significant challenges and shifts, particularly concerning public perception of leadership and the handling of the ongoing crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Leadership and Responsibility
Despite speculation of his removal from power, Russian President Vladimir Putin maintains control over the levers of governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. However, he has shown an unwillingness to appear publicly with bad news and bear responsibility for difficult decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Instead, he has shifted responsibility to Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin and regional governors, demanding action without providing necessary resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

This approach has led to an undefined legal status for the situation in Russia, which is not formally a state of emergency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The Kremlin appears unwilling to accept financial and legal responsibility to society, unlike Western governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Putin, once considered a factor of stability, has become a factor of destabilization due to his apparent lack of confidence and inability to make tough decisions as an authoritarian leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## Economic and Social Impact
Russia's budget is critically dependent on oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Despite official figures suggesting sufficient gold and foreign exchange reserves and a national welfare fund, internal government estimates indicate that current resources may only last until October or November if the status quo continues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This has led to measures like limiting expenses and persistent proposals to devalue the ruble to 100 per dollar to offset lost budget revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

The population is experiencing massive disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Putin's traditional electorate, who previously showed unwavering support, has shifted from sympathy to strong hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Public outrage intensified after a speech that failed to announce a broad program of assistance and support, leaving citizens in despair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. While a mass uprising is not expected immediately, a qualitative change in political behavior is anticipated by autumn, once the epidemic threat subsides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

### True Scale of the Epidemic
The true scale of the epidemic in Russia is being concealed, with official figures not corresponding to reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. The lack of sufficient testing means many cases go undetected or are misdiagnosed as ARVI, flu, or "hospital pneumonia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This concealment, a "Chernobyl habit," contributes to the public's lack of understanding about the situation's depth and consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

## Systemic Ineffectiveness and Political Collapse
The Russian system is proving to be "completely ineffective" in responding to the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. Despite a long period under sanctions and efforts at import substitution, Russia remains critically dependent on imports and cannot even produce enough masks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>. Strict administrative and police measures, such as potential curfews and the use of armed forces, are being considered to enforce quarantine, but Putin hesitates to take direct responsibility for these harsh actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

The long-standing political structure, known for the past 20 years, is starting to collapse rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49">[00:33:49]</a>. This process could take on an avalanche-like character, with authorities becoming more concerned with their own survival and confrontation with [[russian_domestic_political_situation | domestic political issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>. Putin's attempts to change the constitution, particularly regarding presidential terms, have caused significant irritation and are seen as undermining the regime's legal and legitimate foundations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>. His "luck has turned its back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>, and nothing seems to work as planned, with every day playing against Putin and the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a>.

### Regional Governance and Resignations
Appointed governors, who lack a political mandate, are struggling to manage the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>. They look to Moscow for guidance but receive little certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:23">[00:41:23]</a>. Unlike Moscow, regions lack the resources to support their populations through the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. This has led to the system "getting out of hand," with mass resignations among mid-level bureaucrats in several regions, particularly in the south of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>. These officials are afraid of bearing responsibility or being unfairly punished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>.

## Future Outlook
The future of [[internal_political_developments_in_russia | Russia's internal political developments]] is highly unpredictable due to numerous unseen variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>. Significant changes are expected to begin in autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>. There is a strong feeling that current top officials will not be part of the final political configuration at the end of the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>. Some members of the ruling elite are already discussing how to preserve their assets and are discreetly seeking consultations with opposition figures like Navalny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:36">[00:46:36]</a>. It is anticipated that new people will emerge in the political landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:59">[00:47:59]</a>.

### Sanctions and International Relations
While Russia attempts to use the global crisis to push for the lifting of sanctions, success is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. The European Union, needing consensus to lift sanctions, is currently too preoccupied with its own issues to discuss such matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. Long-term, a future of global mutual assistance might lead to a discussion of lifting sanctions, especially if a peaceful resolution is achieved in the relationship between Russia and Ukraine regarding Donbas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>.

### Donbas and Ukraine
The severity of the crisis in Russia is expected to decrease interest in Donbas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. Russia's active pursuit of its goals in Ukraine might cease, especially if all resources are needed internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>. However, there remains a very high level of epidemic spread in the rebellious Donbas, largely due to a non-existent sanitary system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>. The crisis could also lead to Russia using force in Donbas to pressure Ukraine or distract its own society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:13">[00:52:13]</a>. Russia also aims to increase the number of Russian passport holders in Donbas to one million, to be used as a controllable electoral resource for future plebiscites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a>.

### US Elections
The results of the US elections are important to Putin, who desires a Trump victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:42">[00:52:42]</a>. Russia plans to help Trump by using "Ukrainian friends" to provide information on the Biden family's interests in Ukraine, aiming to expose perceived corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:52">[00:52:52]</a>.

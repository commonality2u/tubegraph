Valery Solovey hosted a broadcast featuring Andrey Kosmach, identified as the main specialist in [[occult_practices_in_russian_politics | occultism]] and magical practices in Russia, whose expertise is recognized in Europe and North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The discussion covered various aspects of [[influence_of_occultism_in_russian_politics | occultism]] and magic, including the Bon religion, shamanism, black magic, and ayahuasca rituals, particularly their purported [[mystical_beliefs_among_russian_elite | influence among the Russian elite]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Andrey Kosmach: Specialist in Russian Occultism

Andrey Kosmach is introduced as the leading expert in [[occult_practices_in_russian_politics | occultism]] and magical practices in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. His reputation extends globally, with acceptance in Europe and North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## The Bon Religion and the Ritual Against Putin

The discussion highlights a specific Bon ritual performed in June 2020 and directed against [[putins_occult_interests_and_practices | Putin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

### Historical Characteristics of Bon

The Bon religion is considered one of the world's most complex and mysterious religions, with origins in a prehistoric period not marked by written monuments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. There are two main versions of Bon:
*   **Historical (Eternal) Bon**: An indivisible and eternal practice in Nepal, Tan, and Western Mongolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   **New Bon**: Adapted to Buddhism and having nothing in common with Eternal Bon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

Some researchers describe Bon as shamanism with animistic elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, others as a current within the cult of Kali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, and some even label it as Tibetan Satanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### Persecution and Misinterpretation of Bon

For centuries, Bon was aggressively persecuted by "peace-loving" Buddhists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. In the 20th century, pseudo-studies emerged, aiming to portray Bon as bloody and cruel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. These studies lacked direct contact with Bon priests or authentic texts, often relying on Buddhist sources or author's imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Nikolai Roerich, for instance, in his book *Altai Himalaya*, compared Bon to Christianity and concluded it was an evil phenomenon to be eradicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Such conclusions were often based on a single description by Buddhist monks of a ritual conducted by the "wandering monk" Ja Lama, spiritual mentor to Baron Ungern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Consequences of Pseudo-Bon Practices
> Pseudo-Bon practices, like those associated with Baron Ungern, yield a positive initial result but lead to gloomy and terrible final consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

The true nature of Bon is veiled in secrets, beyond rational understanding, with temple complexes located in hard-to-reach, natural labyrinthine caves in the Nepalese Himalayas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### Authentic Bon Rituals and Consequences

Andrey Kosmach is one of the few Russians who has witnessed authentic Bon rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. He emphasizes that genuine Bon practices are able to change the "algorithm of fate" and teach an individual to control events in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. The fundamental practice in Bon is the achievement of a state of non-duality, which allows a person to comprehend secrets of being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This knowledge is guarded because it can be misused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. Warrior cults within Bon are described as very difficult and bloody, but necessary for significant results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

### The Egregor Ritual of June 2020 and its Effects

On June 21, 2020, during a solar eclipse, a ritual to create an "egregor" was performed in Corregidor Tlaxco, not Nepal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. An egregor is described as a non-material, complex energy substance that can change the trajectory of an individual's fate, specifically targeting the Russian President, whose fate is connected to the entire post-Soviet space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

The egregor's idea is embedded within it, and its formation involves two crucial periods:
1.  **Central part formation**: Coincided with events in Khabarovsk, where peace processes did not subside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.
2.  **Maximum strength culmination (50th day)**: Coincided with the Belarusian elections on August 9, 2020, which led to large-scale protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. This protest "canceled" the Kremlin's desired project of unifying Russia and Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.

From August 9, 2020, it can be stated that the leader's luck factor was "pulled," and fortune turned its back on him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. Metaphysical practices can create serious fluctuations in the vector of movement, leading to the awakening of the masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. However, changing the real situation requires the free will of people and real actions, not just mystical intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.

> [!INFO] Confirmation by Security Services
> The Federal Security Service (FSB) was instructed to verify the information about this ritual and reportedly received full confirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. Specialists sent by the Kremlin visited China and Balkhash, where lamas confirmed the ritual was indeed carried out against [[putins_occult_interests_and_practices | Putin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>. However, the lamas stated they were unable to change its effect, as key details of the authentic Bon practice are carefully guarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

## Shamanism in Russia

[[shamanic_rituals_related_to_the_kremlin | Putin]] is known to communicate with shamans during his visits to Shoigu in Siberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

### Historical Context and Loss of Tradition

Shamanism is based on a dualistic worldview that divides the world into everyday and sacred realms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. While shamans across continents share common features, their distinctive features, especially regarding ritual activity and initiation rites, significantly dominate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. In Russia, the algorithm of the initiation rite was largely lost due to relentless persecution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>. Most ritual algorithms have been preserved only through the enthusiasm of scientist-historians who collected ethnographic materials from the late 1920s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>. However, much scientific research from the Soviet period was lost, as such material was not deemed important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Case of Alexander Gabyshev
> The discussion on shamanism connects to the fate of Alexander Gabyshev, a shaman who was deemed insane and subjected to [[occult_rituals_and_psychiatry_in_Russia | punitive psychiatry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.

### The Shamanic Initiation Rite

Key aspects of shamanic initiation include:
*   **Shamanic gift**: Passed on by inheritance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.
*   **Chosenness by spirits**: Spirits mentally encourage the individual to embark on the path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>.
*   **"Shamanic disease"**: A special condition manifesting in childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>.

The formation of a future shaman occurs over seven to twelve years under the guidance of an experienced shaman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>. Closer to the initiation, a clan council recognizes the individual's right to be a shaman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>. The initiation ritual itself typically lasts several days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.

The process includes:
1.  The shaman mentor leading a specific spirit into their body to determine the rite's correctness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>.
2.  The initiate approaching the mentor to request the rite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.
3.  Ablution and preparation of an elixir from hallucinogenic mushrooms or plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>.
4.  Purification by smoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>.
5.  Slaughter of a sacrificial animal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>.
6.  Presentation of shamanic attributes: crown with horns (symbol of power), staff, whip, tambourine, beater, and ritual costume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>.
7.  The young shaman independently calls on spirits and deities for strength and blessing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.
8.  Culmination: Vision of ancestral spirits entering the shaman's body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>.
9.  Initiation continues until the shaman introduces a determined number of spirits into their body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>.
10. Completion is determined by the vision of the original spirit that opened the ceremony, indicating the ritual's quality and revealing hidden knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.
11. A final ablution ceremony and blessings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>.

While the ritual varies by region in Russia, the described example is a common one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>.

### Modern Vulgarization and Impostors

The modern vulgarization of shamanism has led to significant simplification of its theory and practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>. Practices previously considered impossible are now used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>. Knowledge about shamanism in Russia is fragmented, leading to more versions and hypotheses than answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>.

A theory suggests that the harsh repressive measures against shaman communities in early Soviet Russia stemmed from an incident in 1914 in the Turukhansk region, where Joseph Stalin (Vissarion Dzhugashvili) sided with an Evenki prince against a shaman during a clan council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>.

The widespread belief that shamans are saviors is a modern phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>. Many self-proclaimed shamans in Russia have not undergone authentic initiation, and the tradition has largely been lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>. This means a majority are impostors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>.

### Government's Engagement with Shamans

The Russian government, with "dubious legitimacy," turns to these dubious shamans for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>. They are satisfied with the communication process, which provides a "placebo effect" that calms them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a>. This can be seen as a form of self-deception and group psychotherapy, where they seek to convince themselves of their power and legitimacy by aligning with "higher powers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>.

The government itself creates a trend, leading other segments of society to actively integrate shamanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>. An example given is a shaman being called to the announcement of the verdict for actor Efremov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. Even the government reportedly consults shamans on various issues, including pension reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. They hope shamans will protect their regime from external influences and the "ungrateful taxable population" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>.

## Black Magic and Grimoires

There is a growing interest in "black magic" in modern Russia, often associated with grimoires and collections of ceremonial magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>.

### Inquisition's Role in "Black Magic"

The concept of "black magic" and "black magicians" is described as a "creative creation of the hands of the Holy Roman Inquisition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>. Known works belonging to the segment of black magic have no connection to metaphysics and are not rational; they are figments of the imagination of inquisitor monks from the late Middle Ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>. Authentic historical manuscripts were destroyed or distorted (palimpsest-style) to create new texts aligned with Christian mythological tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>. The purpose of this distortion was to remove descriptions of genuine practices that could allow one to enter the realm of the irrational and change consciousness, space-time, and reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>.

### Authentic vs. Pseudo-Grimoires

Grimoires currently in use, even those purchased at auctions by Russian buyers for "gigantic ideas," are skillfully concocted fakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>. Authentic grimoires are inaccessible to most and are used only by 13 great occult orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>. These genuine grimoires are compiled based on a few ancient ritual texts, such as the Minoan treatise and Medici family manuscripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>. The Minoan treatise, dating back to late antiquity, describes a basic model of ritual construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>.

> [!WARNING] "Grimoire" as a Complex Structure
> What is called a "grimoire" today is a complex ritual structure that cannot be classified as an independent unit; it's a "book in a book." To perform one ritual, two seemingly different grimoires are often required, with parts of the sequence indicated across them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>.

Genuine grimoires do not mention the devil or demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>. Pseudo-grimoires, created by the Catholic Church, are replete with such figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:13">[00:44:13]</a>. The Russian "pseudo-establishment" favors rituals oversaturated with "dream fate" and ceremonial theatricality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>. These "pseudo-rituals" gain popularity in glamorous hotels, including quasi-rituals of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>. These are based on a supposedly authentic treatise of Hermes Trismegistus, which was actually written by a monk named Leonardo under the leadership of Cardinal Giovanni and is classified as a fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>.

> [!INFO] Occultism vs. Faith
> In genuine [[occult_practices_in_russian_politics | occultism]], nothing is taken on faith; any ritual action must be confirmed experimentally and be repeatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:38">[00:46:38]</a>. A study in the 1970s of all known rituals revealed that 97% are "empty and useless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>.

The "pseudo-elite" in Russia resorts to "atavistic overboard" help, using completely inauthentic and contradictory versions of rituals, mixing various pseudo-grimoires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>. A high-ranking Russian official's motive for visiting such places and conducting rituals is described as "Satanism for me as a tool justification of the present and the prospect of the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16">[00:50:16]</a>. This official also attends church out of necessity, comparing it to attending a CPSU party meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a>. This trend of engaging in occult practices has been prevalent in Europe for centuries and in Russia for two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>.

An example of a European cult is found in the Parisian catacombs, specifically a guarded hall called the "crystal sarcophagus." Its walls and ceiling are made of human skulls, and an altar is at its center. This hall hosts masses dedicated to the demon Bael. The supreme minister of this cult is a hermaphrodite, and its adepts include representatives of Europe's most titled aristocratic families, politicians, bankers, and industrialists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>. They believe visiting these places grants them special power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>. However, even these practices offer only a placebo effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.

### "The Cup of the Blind King" Ritual

"The Cup of the Blind King" is described as a completely authentic and effective ritual from the collection of Giovanni di Bicci de Medici <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:36">[01:08:36]</a>. Its key attribute is a golden cup, and it involves 33 textual spells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:14">[01:09:14]</a>.

The ritual sequence:
1.  A pure gold cup is filled with anthropomorphic (human) blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:24">[01:09:24]</a>.
2.  The cup is placed on a hot surface over an open fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:57">[01:09:57]</a>.
3.  The cup is cut in half, spilling its contents onto the hot surface, causing a "violent reaction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>.
4.  From the two halves of the cup, the "golden seal of death" is cast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:26">[01:10:26]</a>.
5.  Each of the 33 spells is written on leather scrolls, which are then burned on the same surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:38">[01:10:38]</a>.
6.  The resulting ash is preserved to make the seal of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>.

The implementation of this ritual is associated with the undermining of mental health, leading to "mental epidemics," induced disorder, and the destruction of identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:20">[01:11:20]</a>. This basic ritual was performed on December 14, 2020, during a solar eclipse in Rio Negro, Argentina, with two related variation rituals performed in Nepal and the Altai Mountains of Mongolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">[01:11:52]</a>. Counter-rites are difficult and dangerous, as they require precise knowledge of all innovations introduced into the ritual, and improper attempts will only strengthen the original effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50">[01:12:50]</a>.

## Ayahuasca and the Russian Elite

A widespread fashion among the Russian establishment, including the president, is traveling to the Amazon in search of shamans and "out-of-body journeys" through ayahuasca <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>.

### Authentic Ayahuasca Rituals

Ayahuasca is considered a "gift from the gods to people" according to mythological concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:17">[00:55:17]</a>. Only those for whom the gift is intended can use it; revealing the secret to a stranger can incur divine wrath and tribal punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>.

Authentic ayahuasca consists of only two components: a liana containing garmin and *Psychotria viridis* which contains dimethyltryptamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>. Its preparation takes many hours, exclusively during daylight, and is consumed after sunset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>. The authentic method is used only in special, infrequent ceremonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>. Other times, a "variation method" with over 30 different components is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>.

The sequence of the ritual is crucial, not just the recipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:49">[00:57:49]</a>. It has three main stages:
1.  **Before the ceremony**: Dedicated participants are given entheogens (plant-based products) to reset consciousness and prepare for a "fully-fledged trance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:19">[00:58:19]</a>. This includes excluding psychodynamic and abstract pipe-like experiences (mixing new experiences with memories), a practice called "walking through the evening fog" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:57">[00:58:57]</a>.
2.  **During the ceremony**: After exiting the "fog," ayahuasca is used, initiating a "full-fledged transpersonal trip" where boundaries of space and time disappear, and a journey within oneself and the universe begins, lasting 4-6 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>.
3.  **After the ceremony**: Another entheogen is given to allow the spirit to return to the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:53">[00:59:53]</a>.

### Commercialized Ayahuasca Tourism

Many Amazonian tribes monetize these rituals due to the temptation of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:03">[00:56:03]</a>. They offer "pilgrims" a complex decoction that gives a hallucinogenic effect akin to ayahuasca but is not authentic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>. For wealthy Russian compatriots, these trips involve private helicopters to "extreme platforms" and comfortable boat rides to "ethnographic villages" specially built for such cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>. These villages are imitations, coming alive only for these events with staged inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:01:50]</a>. Pilgrims are greeted with ritual drums, inspect attractions, and drink the pseudo-ayahuasca in the evening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:20">[01:02:20]</a>. They experience high-quality "hallucinosis" created by their own brains, receiving answers to their questions and returning satisfied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.

These touring shamans are described as "charlatans" running a commercial project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:12">[01:05:12]</a>. They can be sent anywhere and will tell clients what they want to hear, often gleaned through simple physiognomy or collected information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:39">[01:05:39]</a>. This is essentially expensive "psychotherapy" (costing from half a million dollars for "respectable shamans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:19">[01:07:19]</a>), leading to no actual change beyond a temporary calming effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.

### "Advanced" Trance Practices

Another segment of the Russian "pseudo-elite" considers Amazonian shamanism "atavism" and engages in more "advanced" trance practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:35">[01:03:35]</a>. They use a wide range of colloids for trance, including:
*   Exotic Colorado River toad (Bufo alvarius) venom (bufotenin mixed with dimethyltryptamine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:16">[01:04:16]</a>.
*   Simple native paper clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>.
*   Almond compounds (lysergic acid or ergot) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:38">[01:04:38]</a>.

## Introduction to Andrey Kosmach, Occultism Expert
Valery Solovey introduces Andrey Kosmach, a philosopher by education and considered the "main specialist in occultism in Russia" and "the best expert" in magical practices [00:00:29]. Kosmach's expertise is recognized internationally, including in Europe and North America [00:00:48]. This broadcast, in audio-only format, focuses on the problems of [[role_of_mysticism_and_esotericism_in_the_kremlin|occultism]] and magic [00:01:03].

### Screensaver Artwork
The colorful screensaver for the broadcast depicts the demon Bael from Jacques Auguste Simon Collin de Plancy's 19th-century *Infernal Dictionary* [00:01:52]. Many might mistake it for a caricature of Vladimir Putin [00:01:45].

## The Bon Ritual Against Putin
A significant ritual, previously discussed by Solovey and Mark Feigin, was performed in June 2020, directed against Putin [00:02:32].

### Historical Context of the Bon Religion
The Bon religion is regarded as one of the world's most complex and mysterious religions, with origins tracing back to a prehistoric period lacking written monuments [00:03:10]. There are two main versions:
*   **Pain (Historical Bon):** An "indivisible and eternal fight" practiced in Nepal, Tanya, and Western Mongolia [00:03:43].
*   **New Bor (New Bon):** Adapted to Buddhism and distinct from eternal Bon [00:04:03].

Modern "ancient military practices" presented in Nepal are often eclectic performances involving Gallic and Tibetan dance, animal sacrifices, and conducted by Buddhist monks, which are not authentic Bon practices [00:04:15].

### Misinterpretations and Pseudo-Studies of Bon
Researchers offer various, often contradictory, interpretations of Bon, including:
*   Shamanism with animism elements [00:05:07].
*   A current within the cult of Kolya [00:05:17].
*   Tibetan Satanism [00:05:22].

Bon has faced severe persecution for centuries by "peace-loving" (in quotation marks) Buddhists [00:05:46]. In the 20th century, pseudo-studies emerged, aiming to portray Bon as bloody and cruel [00:06:06]. These studies typically lacked direct contact with Bon priests or authentic texts, relying instead on Buddhist sources that reference non-existent earlier texts [00:06:22]. Some works, like Nikolai Roerich's *Altai Himalaya*, even falsely compared Bon to Christianity and Satanism, concluding it was an "evil" phenomenon to be eradicated [00:07:13]. These conclusions were based on a single Buddhist monk's description of a ritual conducted by Baron Ungern's spiritual mentor, Ja Lama, which was a "new bor" ritual, not true eternal Bon [00:07:51].

The reality of the Greek Bon religion is veiled in secrecy and beyond rational understanding [00:10:03]. Its temple complexes are labyrinthine natural caves in the Nepalese Himalayas, stretching for hundreds of kilometers [00:10:21]. Andrey Kosmach confirms he is one of the few Russians to have witnessed authentic Bon rituals firsthand [00:11:24].

### Purpose and Fundamental Practices
These practices and rituals are believed to change the "algorithm of fate" and teach individuals to control events in the world [00:12:08]. The fundamental practice of Bon, which is the cornerstone for all other rituals, is the achievement of a state of non-duality [00:13:06]. Lao Tzu noted that duality arises from the discrepancy between feeling and reason [00:13:29]. Through gradual study, one can learn many secrets of being [00:13:41]. Bon is a closed tradition because modern humans are not capable of understanding these harmonious practices [00:13:49]. Warrior priests believe that those who accidentally comprehend this knowledge will misuse it [00:14:01]. These practices aim to achieve harmony and balance, overcome the "main enemy" (oneself), and pass through "distorted centuries of nature" [00:14:19]. Warrior cults are difficult and bloody, but their results are significant [00:14:41].

### The Egregor Ritual Against Putin (June 2020)
On June 21, 2020, during a solar eclipse (137th Saros period), a ritual to create an "Egregor" was performed in Corrigan Taxcom (not Nepal) [00:15:15]. An Egregor is a non-material, complex energy substance capable of changing the trajectory of an individual's fate, specifically linked to the fate of the post-Soviet space, referring to the President of the Russian Federation [00:15:39]. The idea embedded in the Egregor determines its nature [00:16:13].

Two crucial periods in Egregor formation are the creation of its central part and its culmination (gaining maximum strength on the 50th day) [00:16:25].
*   **Central Part Formation:** Coincided with continuous protests in Khabarovsk [00:16:58].
*   **Maximum Strength (50th day):** On August 9, 2020, elections in Belarus escalated into large-scale protests, canceling the Kremlin's coveted project of unifying Russia and Belarus [00:17:10].

From August 9, 2020, it is asserted that the "luck factor" left the Russian leader, and "fortune turned its back on him" [00:17:41]. This demonstrates how metaphysical practices can create "serious fluctuations in the vector of movement," awakening the masses from a state of "pseudo-wakefulness" [00:17:55]. However, real change requires the free will and action of people, not just "couch fighters" [00:18:23].

### Official Confirmation and Inability to Reverse
The Federal Security Service (FSB) was instructed to verify this information and found it to be fully confirmed [00:19:06]. Specialists sent by the Kremlin to the "Celestial Empire" (China) and then Balkhash met with lamas [00:19:23]. The lamas confirmed that the Bon ritual against Putin had been carried out, but stated that it was "absolutely impossible" to reverse its effect [00:19:51]. This is because Buddhists do not possess key details of Bon practice, which are carefully guarded secrets [00:20:11]. The ritual changes the metaphysical vector, but the realization of "opened opportunities" depends on the "free will of people" [00:20:42]. Without people's participation, the process itself won't fully unfold [00:20:55].

## Shamanism in Russia
Vladimir Putin reportedly consults with shamans during his visits with Shoigu [00:21:38].

### Authenticity and History of Shamanism
To understand if Putin's consultations are effective, one must differentiate between authentic and inauthentic practices [00:22:18]. A key question is whether self-proclaimed shamans have undergone proper initiation [00:22:51]. Shamanism is rooted in a dualistic worldview, dividing the world into everyday and sacred realms [00:23:42]. While commonalities exist across continents, distinctive features, especially in the initiation rite, significantly dominate [00:24:03].

In Russia, the algorithm for the initiation rite was "practically lost" due to ruthless persecution [00:24:16]. Most ritual algorithms survived only through the efforts of historian-scientists who collected ethnographic materials from the late 1920s [00:24:33]. Much scientific research from the Soviet period was lost, as it was not considered important [00:24:51].

### Shamanic Initiation Rite
Key aspects of a shamanic initiation rite include:
*   **Shamanic Gift:** Passed down by inheritance [00:25:17].
*   **Chosenness by Spirits:** Spirits mentally encourage the shaman to embark on this difficult path [00:25:26].
*   **Shamanic Disease:** A special condition manifesting in childhood [00:25:43].

The formation of a future shaman takes 7 to 12 years under the guidance of an experienced shaman [00:25:54]. Leading up to the initiation:
1.  A clan council recognizes the initiate's right to be a shaman [00:26:12].
2.  A date is set for the multi-day initiation [00:26:23].
3.  The mentor shaman opens the ritual by inviting a specific spirit into their body to ensure correctness [00:26:31]. Each shaman has their own unique spirit [00:26:54]. Only a shaman with a crown and cane can instill this spirit [00:27:01].
4.  The initiate asks the mentor to lead the rite [00:27:11].
5.  A ritual ablution is performed, and an elixir (hallucinogenic mushrooms or tracks) is prepared [00:27:20].
6.  Purification by smoke follows, then the slaughter of a sacrificial animal [00:27:32].
7.  Shamanic attributes are presented: a crown with horns, staff, whip, tambourine, beater, and a ritual costume made from animal skin [00:27:48].
8.  The young shaman independently calls upon spirits and deities for strength and blessing [00:28:11].
9.  The culmination is the vision of ancestral spirits entering the shaman's body [00:28:21].
10. Initiation continues until the shaman introduces a determined number of spirits into their body [00:28:32].
11. The original spirit that opened the ceremony returns to confirm the ritual's quality and reveal hidden knowledge [00:28:51].
12. A final ablution and blessings conclude the ceremony [00:29:13].

Modern shamanism in Russia has undergone "vulgarization," simplifying its theory and practice [00:29:48]. It now incorporates previously impossible or unacceptable elements and local territorial features [00:29:58]. Knowledge about shamanism in Russia is fragmented, leading to more versions than answers [00:30:17].

### [[Influence of occultism on political figures|Political and Societal Aspects of Shamanism in Russia]]
A version exists that explains the harsh repressive measures against shamanic communities in young Soviet Russia:
*   It references archival data from Turukhansk, Yenisei province, in 1914 [00:30:46].
*   Joseph Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili (Stalin) was in internal exile there [00:31:00].
*   A report from a provincial police department employee, Sable, states that Dzhugashvili attended a clan council where a shaman and an Evenki prince vied for chairmanship [00:31:15].
*   Dzhugashvili took the side of the local prince [00:31:49], after which an "unpleasant incident" occurred with the shaman [00:31:55], and Dzhugashvili was moved to Kureika [00:32:05]. This version suggests a historical precedent for state suppression of shamanism.

In contemporary Russia, there is a "savior shaman" who claims to have received his "stone" from a "distant heap" and will free people from injustice and despotism [00:32:32]. The Russian government itself also believes in shamans as protectors and consults them on various issues, including pension reform [00:32:51]. The government hopes shamans can protect its regime from external influences and the "ungrateful taxable population" [00:33:14].

However, the authenticity of modern Russian shamans is dubious; many are impostors due to the loss of initiation traditions [00:33:36]. The government engages with "pseudo-shamans" for a "placebo effect," calming them and giving legitimacy to their "power claims" [00:34:23]. This creates a trend that other societal representatives also follow, leading to "comic phantasmagoric options," such as a shaman being called during actor Efremov's verdict announcement [00:35:40].

## Black Magic and Grimoires
Interest in black magic is growing in modern Russia [00:37:01]. This magic is supposedly recorded in grimoires and collections of ceremonial magic [00:37:06].

### Authenticity of Grimoires
Andrey Kosmach asserts that "black magicians" and "black magic" lack historical roots [00:37:34]. Black magic is a "creative creation" of the Holy Roman Inquisition [00:37:51]. Most known works attributed to black magic have no connection to metaphysics and are "a figment of the imagination" of medieval inquisitors [00:38:01]. Original historical manuscripts describing genuine [[Occult practices in Russian politics|occultism]] were barbarically destroyed, with texts erased and new, distorted ones written over them to prevent access to the "realm of the irrational" and what truly changes consciousness, space-time, and reality [00:38:31].

Therefore, grimoires currently bought at auctions by wealthy Russians, even for "gigantic ideas" (prices), are "skillfully concocted fake[s]" [00:39:37]. These fakes served the Christian ideological doctrine by creating a fictitious enemy to fight and regularly claim victory over [00:40:55].

Genuine grimoires, used by 13 great [[Occult practices in Russian politics|occult orders]], are based on ancient ritual texts like the Minoan tract, Medici family manuscripts, and other independent sources [00:41:16]. The Minoan treatise describes a basic ritual sequence that has survived in its original version, with the earliest rewritten version dating to late antiquity [00:42:09]. These texts were written in a complex algorithmic form, referencing even more ancient monuments that are now lost [00:42:31]. A single ritual may require information from two different genuine grimoires [00:43:09]. Genuine grimoires do not mention the devil or demons, unlike the pseudo-grimoires created by the Catholic Church [00:44:05].

The Russian "pseudo establishment" favors rituals saturated with "dream fate" and "ceremonial theatricality" [00:44:46]. High-ranking Russian officials engage in such rituals to justify their present and future [00:50:16]. One official stated that Satanism for him is a "tool justification of the present and the prospect of the future" [00:50:41]. This official also visits church as a "necessity," comparing it to attending a CPSU party meeting in Soviet times [00:51:07]. This trend of engaging with such practices has existed in Europe for centuries but only for two decades in Russia [00:51:32].

An example of European [[occult_rites_and_political_synchronization_in_russia|occult rites]] is a guarded hall in the Parisian catacombs called the "crystal sarcophagus" with walls and ceiling made of human skulls [00:51:55]. Masses dedicated to the demon Bael are held there, led by a hermaphrodite "supreme minister" [00:52:17]. Adepts include titled aristocratic families, politicians, bankers, and industrialists from Europe and France [00:52:37]. They firmly believe these visits grant them special power [00:52:47]. However, such practices, like those described in Arthur Perez-Reverte's *The Dumas Club*, are ultimately a "placebo" and do not bring real-life benefits, as seen with a former president who faced criminal punishment [00:53:12].

[[Occultism]] is completely opposite to faith; nothing is taken on faith [00:46:38]. Any ritual action must be experimentally confirmed and repeatable [00:46:48]. In the 1970s, an occult order studied and tested all known rituals, finding that 97% were "empty and spoons" (useless) [00:47:09]. The truly authentic grimoires are "completely inaccessible" to all but the 13 great [[Occult practices in Russian politics|occult orders]] [00:48:00]. Using fake grimoires can lead to the opposite of the desired result, being "harmful" [00:48:39]. The Russian pseudo-elite uses an "eclectic mix" of pseudo-grimoires, which Kosmach dismisses as "other rubbish" [00:49:53].

## Ayahuasca and Amazonian Shamans
There is a fashion among the Russian elite and middle class for trips to the Amazon in search of local shamans and out-of-body journeys via "ayahuasca" [00:54:11]. However, what is offered is often not true ayahuasca [00:54:33].

### Authentic Ayahuasca vs. Commercialized Versions
Ayahuasca, in mythological concepts, is a gift from the gods [00:55:17]. Only those to whom the gift is intended, i.e., members of the tribe, may use it [00:55:28]. Revealing the secret to a stranger could anger the gods and bring illness and difficulties upon the tribe [00:55:35]. However, the temptation of money leads many tribes to offer a "complex decoction" instead of authentic hallucinogenic ayahuasca to wealthy pilgrims [00:56:03]. This decoction provides a hallucinogenic effect akin to a real one but is not authentic [00:56:21].

**Authentic Ayahuasca:**
*   Consists of only two components: *liana copy* (containing harmin and harmaline) and *chakruna* (containing dimethyltryptamine) [00:56:35].
*   Preparation takes many hours, exclusively during daylight [00:56:51].
*   Consumed after sunset [00:57:01].
*   Used only in special, infrequent ceremonies [00:57:07].
*   The "variation method" involves over 30 different components [00:57:17].
*   The key is the sequence of the ritual, not the recipe or components [00:57:49].

**Three Main Stages of the Ritual Sequence:**
1.  **Before ceremony:** Dedicated participants are given plant-based entheogens to reset consciousness and prepare for a full trance [00:58:19]. This helps avoid "walking through the evening fog" (a mixture of new experiences and memories) [00:59:04].
2.  **During ceremony:** After preparing, ayahuasca is used, and a "full-fledged transpersonal trip" begins, where space and time boundaries disappear, lasting 4-6 hours [00:59:26].
3.  **After completion:** Another entheogen is given to help the "eternal spirit" return to the body and avoid getting lost [00:59:53].

### Commercial Ayahuasca Tours for the Elite
Russian "rich compatriots" travel to the Amazon's tropical forests for healing and other benefits [01:00:49]. They fly on private helicopters to an "extreme platform" and then travel by boat to a "so-called ethnographic village" built specifically for these cases [01:01:20]. This village is usually uninhabited, with residents only arriving for these events, creating an "imitation of life" [01:01:50].

Pilgrims are greeted with ritual drums and songs, inspecting "tropical attractions" during the day [01:02:19]. In the evening, they drink the offered ayahuasca, which induces a "very high-quality hallucinosis" created by the brain [01:02:40]. They believe they contact spirits and receive answers to their questions [01:02:50]. They leave feeling "tired [and] satisfied" [01:03:10]. Both the "Indians" (tribes) and the pilgrims are satisfied [01:03:28].

These "touring performers" (shamans) who visit Ukraine and Russia are essentially charlatans [01:05:12]. This is a "commercial project" for many civilized Amazonian tribes to monetize rich "fools" [01:05:22]. Such shamans can be sent anywhere, including Moscow or Toronto, and will tell clients "what they want to hear" [01:05:39]. They primarily act as a form of "psychotherapy," costing hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars per session, delivering calming effects rather than real change [01:06:21].

### "Advanced" Occultism and Psychedelics
Another segment of the Russian pseudo-elite considers Amazonian shamanism "atavism" [01:03:39]. They prefer "reptiloid flights to Nibiru" or "connecting with Sirius" [01:03:58]. This "advanced" group uses a wide range of colloids for trance, from exotic Colorado River toad venom (containing bufotenin mixed with dimethyltryptamine) to traditional psilocybin mushrooms [01:04:12].

## The Cup of the Blind King Ritual
This authentic ritual, unlike most grimoires, is "completely authentic" and "very effective" [01:08:36]. It is from the collection of Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici [01:09:11].

**Key Aspects of the Ritual:**
1.  **Golden Cup:** Made of pure gold, filled with "anthropomorphic manat" (human blood) [01:09:14].
2.  **Ritual Action:** The cup is placed on a hot surface with an open fire underneath [01:09:57].
3.  **Cutting the Cup:** The cup must be cut in half, spilling its contents onto the hot surface, causing a "violent reaction" [01:10:06].
4.  **Golden Seal of Death:** From the two halves, a "golden seal of death" is cast [01:10:26].
5.  **Spells:** 33 spells are written on leather scrolls, fastened with a special seal [01:10:37].
6.  **Burning Scrolls:** The scrolls are burned on the same surface where the cup was located [01:10:54].
7.  **Preserving Ash:** The resulting ash is preserved and used to make the "seal of death" [01:11:05].

### Consequences and Performance
The implementation of this ritual is associated with the undermining of the "mental and ghetto" and the emergence of "mental epidemics," ranging from induced disorders to the destruction of identity [01:11:16].

This basic ritual was performed on December 14, 2020, during a solar eclipse (142nd Saros) in Rio Negro province, Argentina [01:11:52]. Two related variation rituals were also performed in Nepal and Mongolia [01:12:11]. The ritual's complexity lies in its fundamental immutability combined with permitted "innovations" that complicate its structure [01:12:25]. To counter or level out its consequences, one must know not only the basic part but also all introduced innovations [01:12:50]. Any experimental attempts at a "counter-rite" without precise knowledge of the substance and innovations will only strengthen the original effect [01:13:10]. Like Frida's scarf in Bulgakov's *Master and Margarita*, this ritual cannot be changed, and counter-rites are "doomed to failure" and will only strengthen it [01:14:04].

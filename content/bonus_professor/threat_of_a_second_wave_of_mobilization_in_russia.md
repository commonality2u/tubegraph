The threat of a second wave of [[potential_mobilization_in_russia | mobilization]] in Russia is considered very real, linked to President Vladimir Putin's abandonment of peace negotiations with Ukraine and an expected escalation of military action [00:01:17].

## Expected Timeline and Scope
A second stage of [[renewed_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] is expected with a very high probability, likely to be announced after the New Year holidays, potentially in mid-January [00:01:55]. While there is a radical viewpoint suggesting it could begin simultaneously with the draft in December, January is considered more probable [00:03:06]. This new stage may not be explicitly called "mobilization" but rather "parts of stabilization" within a "people's war" concept proposed by Kiriyenko [00:02:09].

This second stage will be more comprehensive than the first, encompassing categories of individuals who were not initially called up [00:02:21]. Authorities reportedly view the first stage of [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]] as successful, as people generally complied despite a lack of desire [00:02:29]. The "mobilized base" for this new stage is estimated to be around seven million people, including women with military registration specialties [00:04:19].

## Expansion of Martial Law
Along with the second stage of [[mobilization_and_the_state_of_the_russian_army | mobilization]], the introduction and expansion of martial law are anticipated [00:01:40]. Currently, martial law applies only to the so-called "new territories" within the Russian Federation, but it is expected to be expanded to other areas, including the capital and large cities [00:03:26]. The exact timing of this expansion will depend on the evolving situation [00:03:41].

### Impact on Civil Liberties
Martial law would introduce several restrictions on the remnants of civil liberties and rights for citizens of the Russian Federation [00:01:44]. These restrictions may include:
*   **Travel restrictions** outside the Russian Federation [00:03:52]. While not explicitly a complete ban for all citizens, it would highly likely limit the right to travel for those included in the mobilized base [00:04:04].
*   **Restrictions on movement** between regions within the Russian Federation [00:03:59].
*   **Detention** of individuals without charges for 30 days, with the possibility of unlimited extension [00:04:52].
*   **Requisitioning** of premises and means of transport by military-civilian authorities [00:05:10]. While theoretically applicable to Moscow, this is not expected to be widely implemented there [00:05:26].
*   **Curfews** and restrictions on the operation of cultural, educational, and entertainment establishments, similar to measures during the pandemic [00:05:36].

All these measures are expected to occur with a very high probability after the New Year, within the framework of the "popular wave of war" concept [00:05:47].

## Personal Advice for Citizens
In light of these predictions, citizens are advised to form a survival strategy [00:01:01].
*   For men of draft age or those potentially subject to [[potential_mobilization_and_public_dissent_in_russia | mobilization]], the key question is whether they want to end up in the trenches [00:01:08].
*   Those with resources to leave Russia should do so [00:01:08], as leaving will likely become impossible once the second stage of [[impact_of_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] begins [00:04:45].
*   If leaving Russia is not an option, consider moving within Russia to a safer location [00:01:08].
*   Citizens are advised to legally acquire weapons if possible [00:19:30].
*   It is recommended to coordinate with neighbors (in apartment buildings, stairwells, or yards) on forms of interaction, as this will be necessary [00:19:39].
*   For underage school students, continued education is strongly recommended, especially if the institution offers state accreditation that provides a deferment from conscription [00:24:02]. If that's not possible, finding a place to "sit out" a few difficult months is advised [00:24:15].

The overarching advice is to consider personal values, specifically valuing one's own life and the lives of family and friends, and to act accordingly [00:25:14].

## Related Considerations
### Perception of First Mobilization
From the Kremlin's perspective, the first stage of [[hidden_mobilization_and_economic_impact_in_russia | mobilization]] was deemed successful [00:02:29]. People, despite lacking enthusiasm, largely complied and went to mobilization points and then to the front [00:02:36]. Reports of letters from the front, even if they reach relatives, are not considered significant by the Kremlin [00:02:44].

### Potential Ukrainian Incursion
The possibility of Ukrainian armed forces entering Russian territory or advancing towards Moscow is being considered by Russia's military leadership [00:17:00]. As a result, defensive barriers are being created to strengthen border areas and Crimea [00:17:15]. However, it is anticipated that any penetration would not be deep, and Ukrainian forces are not expected to go beyond these border zones due to serious blocking reasons [00:17:23].

Valery Solovey's 55th episode of "What's Happening" discusses the distinction between "information reasons" (or "information noise") and actual "events" that affect the situation in Russia [00:01:10]. The past week, according to Solovey, was "rich in information reasons," primarily produced by the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin [00:01:52].

## Information Noise and Putin's Doubles
Many of Putin's recent public appearances are characterized as "information garbage" [00:02:01]. These include alleged trips to Ulan-Ude, Crimea, and Mariupol, as well as a speech before the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs [00:02:13]. Solovey asserts that only the speech to businessmen was personally attended by Vladimir Putin [00:02:32]. In all other instances, a "double of Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin" was the key figure [00:02:46].

The presence of Putin's doubles, used in "key direction of Russian allegedly domestic policy" for "noise production," has become widely known abroad and is no longer doubted in the West [00:03:06]. Solovey states that the real Putin would "never in his life go to a place where he could be threatened by even a hypothetical danger" [00:03:45]. The double can even "look even better than the Russian president" [00:04:01]. Putin's appearance before businessmen was necessary because many people know him there, and his absence would have been "indecent" [00:04:21]. Solovey notes that Putin appeared to be "on speed" or "on very strong stimulants" during his speech to businessmen, which "revived... his mental activity" in an unusual way [00:05:02].

These appearances are categorized as "information reasons" because they "did not affect and could not affect the real situation and the state of affairs in the country" [00:05:22].

## Putin's Declining Standing
Russian industrialists and entrepreneurs left Putin's speech "extremely disappointed" as they received no answers to their concerns [00:05:35]. Furthermore, many "marshals" or "admirals of Russian business" deliberately did not attend the meeting to avoid falling under sanctions [00:05:51]. Solovey claims that "for the most or for some of the richest people in Russia, Vladimir Vladimirovich looks like a leper" [00:06:06]. Before February 24, 2022, they sought closeness to him for material gain, but now they "avoid the Russian president, try to distance themselves from him because Putin is a toxic asset" [00:06:17].

## Key Event: Xi Jinping's Visit
The primary "event" that will significantly impact Russian domestic and potentially foreign policy is the visit of Xi Jinping to Moscow [00:06:46]. As of the recording on March 20, the Kremlin was in anticipation of this visit, stating they would "judge by the facts" [00:07:29]. Solovey notes that Putin himself is "not in very good physical shape," and efforts were made over the weekend to "bring him to his senses" for Xi Jinping's arrival [00:07:48].

China's objectives are purely self-serving; it "always everywhere at all times pursues its own goals" [00:08:22]. Regarding Russia, China's aim is to "transform the Russian Federation and its spheres of interest... to such an extent in the international arena that Russia is weak and ends up tied to China" [00:08:45]. China does not desire a strong Russia, but rather a "weakened Russia" [00:09:03]. However, China also does not want an "absolute, complete defeat of Russia on the Ukrainian fronts" because it would be a "bad sign for China itself" that autocracies are losing to the consolidated West [00:09:12]. China's peace initiatives are unlikely to succeed, as the US has already deemed them unacceptable, a position shared by Ukrainian leadership [00:09:55].

## International Criminal Court Warrant
A significant event that has already occurred is the International Criminal Court (ICC) issuing a warrant for Vladimir Putin on suspicion of committing war crimes [00:10:21]. While Russia, China, India, and the United States do not recognize the ICC's jurisdiction [00:10:45], Solovey emphasizes that "no one seriously expects that the Russian president will voluntarily or forcibly end up in The Hague" [00:10:57].

Nevertheless, the warrant's issuance has "greatly influenced the situation in Russia and in the world" in several ways:
*   **Legal-Symbolic Aspect**: It sets a "very important precedent and the first step" by moving the persecution of high-ranking Russian officials from the realm of politics and propaganda to a legal plane [00:11:24]. Other officials are now "cringing" despite public declarations of solidarity [00:11:49].
*   **Domestic Political Aspect**: Before February 24, Putin was seen as a "guarantor of wealth and privileges," but after, he became a "toxic asset" that the elite wishes to discard [00:12:46]. While the Russian elite may react passively and with internal grumbling, there are "groups of people capable of extremely decisive actions" who are increasingly considering practical steps [00:13:06]. Xi Jinping's visit could serve as a "trigger for certain actions" [00:13:56].
*   **International Political Aspect**: Putin is now perceived as an "international leper" with whom it is "better not to deal" [00:14:13]. This "Black Mark" and the changed atmosphere around him, and the Kremlin, are significant [00:14:35]. The German Minister of Justice, for instance, stated that Putin would be arrested if he appeared on German territory [00:14:40].
*   **Putin's Mental State**: The warrant plunged Putin into a "deep depression" [00:15:15]. His mental state is "frankly upset," and there's a "professional medical qualification of his mental state" that has been reported [00:15:34]. This increases the "risk of unforeseen actions" or "dangerous decisions," which his closest circle understands [00:16:04]. These "decisive people" are "seriously beginning to think about the fact that the future... is extremely unpleasant in its consequences, much closer than before" [00:16:26].

## [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | Hidden Mobilization]]
A new stage of [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]] has begun, described as "hidden," "parallel," "quiet," or "veiled" [00:16:40]. Even if the term "[[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]]" isn't used, the process is ongoing in other forms [00:16:59]. These include invitations to "verify documents," which are happening in "more than 45 regions of the Russian Federation," and summonses for military training [00:17:15].

Some military commissariats, like Buryatia's, have openly stated that "[[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]] with us did not stop" because the decree on its beginning was issued, but not one on its end [00:17:36]. There are also unconfirmed reports that the Penza military commissar stated that university graduates would receive a notice along with their diploma [00:18:12].

The system of influence in Russian politics relies on "blackmail, threats of violence, and promises" [00:18:41]. People are being pressured to go to the front with offers of high salaries (e.g., 200,000 rubles a month) [00:19:08]. If they resist, they are accused of not being a patriot or going "against the people" [00:19:41]. This combination is effective because the "unfortunate people" are "used to obediently following where the authorities lead them" [00:19:51]. Solovey warns of a "very high risk" that these measures will "force a considerable number of people to join the active army" [00:20:13]. A large number of people are needed (an additional 400,000 or more) in the next one and a half to two months in anticipation of a Ukrainian counteroffensive [00:20:33]. The Kremlin is reportedly confident there will be no protests [00:20:46].

## [[impact_of_political_actions_on_russian_society_and_economy | Economic Impact]]
The "special military operation" and Putin's policies have had a devastating [[impact_of_political_actions_on_russian_society_and_economy | economic impact]] on Russia [00:21:10]. New figures indicate that "the war has zeroed out 10 years of labor" [00:21:24].
*   Real incomes of Russians are 6.5% lower than in 2013 [00:21:26].
*   The actual volume of goods consumption is 9.1% less than in 2013, which was the "last measured peaceful year" [00:21:35].

This represents "10 years down the drain" as a "brilliant result of Putin's foreign foreign policy and Putin's economic growth" [00:21:46]. Solovey suggests that eventually, this phrase will be used to describe the results of Putin's entire 22-23 years of rule, representing "almost a quarter of a century torn out of life" [00:22:11].

## China's Stance on [[military_and_political_dynamics_between_russia_and_ukraine | Military and Political Dynamics Between Russia and Ukraine]]

During the visit of Xi Jinping to Moscow, Russia sought to evaluate the results of this visit, which proved successful and useful for China but unsuccessful and not useful for the Russian Federation, and disappointing for President Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. China secured cheap gas with a huge discount, liquefied natural gas obligations, and an agreement for a new gas pipeline built at Russia's expense, supplied with heavily discounted gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. China also received Russia's commitments to all investment projects and economic requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Russia agreed to pay in yuan for trade with Latin America and Asia, which exclusively benefits China by expanding the yuan's global appeal and tying Russia closer to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. In return, Russia received "beautiful, high-flown, flowery oriental formulas" about being reliable partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### Military Equipment Supply

President Putin was particularly disappointed that China did not even promise to supply Russia with lethal military equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. China already supplies non-lethal goods intended for the armed forces and will continue to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Russia is in dire need of military equipment "here and now" to repel the anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive in the spring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. China responded with "friendly reprimands," affectionately patting Putin on the shoulder or cheek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The speaker notes that such a gesture is afforded by a very strong and self-confident party that believes it dominates the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

China vaguely indicated readiness to revisit the issue of lethal weapons in the summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This delay is attributed to China's desire to observe the results of the Ukrainian counteroffensive; supplying weapons sooner could worsen relations with the United States without guaranteeing Russian success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

It is suggested that Xi Jinping made a "very serious mistake" in February of the previous year by giving Putin consent for a "lightning fast and large-scale military operation" that was assured to lead to triumphant success in days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

## Nuclear Rhetoric and Military Strategy

The "nuclear rhetoric" has "died down," but the threat remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. During negotiations with Xi Jinping, Putin reportedly justified the need for Chinese weapons by stating that Russia "cannot lose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. If Russia cannot lose, then in the event of a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive, it would have "no other choice" except to use tactical nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. This option is "on the table" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

## Impact on Bordering Russian Regions

Regarding living in Russian regions bordering Ukraine, a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive would aim to reach the 1991 border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Some border areas of regions like Kursk, Belgorod, and Bryansk are already exposed to fire and could see Ukrainian troops entering their territory for a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. While these troops would not stay, and peaceful life would return after a peace treaty, residents are advised to leave these territories, especially those very close to the border, for security and common sense reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

## Post-Conflict Russia-Ukraine Relations

A future political force in Russia would not pursue a policy towards Ukraine similar to Putin's, nor would it impose "brotherly love" or focus on "original Russian lands," Donbass, Crimea, or "offended Russian speakers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. Russia's goal would be "only Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. The ongoing "special military operation" is described as the "angling exhalation" of a country that tried to return to imperial status, demonstrating Russia's lack of desire, resources, and moral/volitional capacity for such ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. The status of Donbass and Crimea will be determined by peace negotiations, with their possibility and content heavily dependent on military dynamics and results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

## Intensification of Repressions

Following an arrest warrant issued for Putin by the International Criminal Court, repressions will be intensified against those who disagree and even those who agree but attempt to express their own opinions publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>. This intensification is not directly connected to the warrant, but the warrant may strengthen surveillance and control over Russian elites, including oligarchs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>.

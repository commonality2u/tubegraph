A new "conflict field" or "hot spot" has emerged concerning transit to the Kaliningrad region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. This situation raises concerns about the potential opening of a "Second Front" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Lithuania's Transit Ban to Kaliningrad

Lithuania initiated this situation by banning a significant portion of transit to the Kaliningrad region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. It is speculated that this decision was intended to demonstrate Lithuania's "independent sovereign status" and was adopted "arbitrarily," possibly without influence from Brussels, which is interested in improving relations with the Russian Federation rather than provoking it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. NATO and the European Union are not interested in escalation, as a conflict involving Lithuania could potentially lead to a "hot phase" that NATO does not need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

### Russian Response and "Force Blackmail"

The possibility of conflict stemming from this situation is considered "unfortunately real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Russia is preparing to demonstrate its "capabilities of force," engaging in "force blackmail" rather than direct actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## Involvement of Belarus

To exert pressure on Lithuania, Russia considers involving [[political_situation_in_belarus_and_its_relationship_with_russia | Belarus]] in the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. This could involve provocations carried out from Belarusian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

### Putin's Pressure on Lukashenko

Intensive negotiations occurred between [[russian_political_dynamics_and_influence_in_belarus | Putin and Lukashenko]] recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Putin's objective, or "id√©e fixe," is to restore the unity of the Soviet Union, at least in the form of a union of East Slavic countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Pressure on [[lukashenko_and_early_presidential_elections_in_belarus | Lukashenko]] has reportedly intensified, even escalating to "foul language," to compel [[future_of_belarus_under_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] towards a "real union" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

A means of involving [[political_situation_in_belarus_and_its_relationship_with_russia | Belarus]] in this union is to simultaneously integrate it into Russia's "force blackmail" network against Lithuania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. This also includes the involvement of the Belarusian military in confrontation with [[ukraines_potential_offensive_and_its_implications | Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Sources indicate that the situation became so difficult that [[lukashenko_and_early_presidential_elections_in_belarus | Lukashenko]] reportedly gave consent to demands from Putin during a recent meeting, saying, "I agree to the Supreme Court. Only leave me free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Despite this, it is considered unlikely that [[lukashenko_and_early_presidential_elections_in_belarus | Lukashenko]] will not attempt to evade Moscow's influence, as he has for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### European Union's Economic Blackmail

While Russia hints at forceful blackmail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, the European Union may resort to "economic blackmail" against Lithuania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. The EU could threaten to refuse subsidies and transfers to Lithuania, a country heavily reliant on EU financial assistance, if it does not make concessions regarding the transit issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

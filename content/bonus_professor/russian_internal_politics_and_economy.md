Valery Solovyov, a doctor of historical sciences, political analyst, and public figure, discussed the [[economic_and_political_situation_in_Russia | economic and political situation in Russia]] on April 18, 2022, focusing on the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine as the "main nerve of Russian politics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. He noted that discussing [[russian_political_climate | Russian politics]] inevitably involves addressing this conflict as the dominant factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Approaching Conflict Culmination

The speaker suggested that the armed confrontation was approaching its culmination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. From the Russian side, the Kremlin had not achieved any of its combat missions or political goals set at the beginning of its campaign against Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The death of the cruiser *Varyag*, which remained publicly unexplained with vague hints, and the lack of announced casualties or mourning, created a "painful impression" and called into question the effectiveness of the "limited special military operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. It was clear that the Russian leadership needed a strategic turning point on the fronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

The Ukrainian side, supported by the West, did not intend to meet Russia's ultimatum demands, believing the fate of peace talks would be decided on the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Ukrainian leadership believed it could inflict significant damage on Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. These factors contributed to the approaching culmination of the armed crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

Symptoms of this culmination included the concentration of Russian troops in Donbass to create a "cauldron" for Ukrainian armed forces, while the West rapidly sent complex and strike weapons to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The Battle of Donbass was considered the key event of the confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Information from the most senior Russian military indicated a lack of confidence in victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The confrontation was expected to be "extremely fierce" with obvious signs of bitterness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## Escalation Risks

The risk of escalation was "very high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. If the Kremlin failed to achieve its combat missions and political goals (forcing Ukraine to sign peace on favorable terms), the risks of using weapons of mass destruction, including low-yield tactical nuclear weapons, would increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. The possibility of using tactical nuclear weapons was constantly discussed during discussions about the situation in Donbass and Ukraine, confirmed by various Western sources, including American military and intelligence, such as the head of the CIA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

The term "weapons of mass destruction" also implied chemical and bacteriological weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Representatives of the Russian Ministry of Defense and self-proclaimed republics constantly hinted that Ukrainians would commit provocations against civilians or might possess chemical weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. These "transparent hints" suggested a potential escalation mechanism for the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

The Russian leadership understood that Ukraine's effective resistance was largely due to advanced Western weapon supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. This created a temptation to interrupt these logistical chains, potentially with tactical nuclear weapons strikes on Ukrainian territory or neighboring countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. While discussed, no decision had been made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

Another escalation mechanism involved strikes by the opposing side on military and civilian targets within Russian territory, especially regions adjacent to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Ukraine was expected to receive missiles capable of reaching Russian military airfields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Finally, terrorist attacks in Moscow and other large Russian cities were another potential trigger for escalation, with vague hints appearing in official Russian media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

The speaker urged prayers to avoid the "most terrible path" that could trigger a mechanism of self-destruction on a significant, perhaps global, scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. He likened the current global situation to the Cuban Missile Crisis, suggesting it might be even more acute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

## Possible Future Developments

Assuming the most dangerous option is avoided, three possibilities for further developments were outlined:
1.  **Peace Treaty:** This seemed unlikely due to the "absolutely unrealizable" Russian demands from the Ukrainian side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
2.  **Truce:** A cessation of hostilities, either partial or full <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
3.  **Continuation of Sluggish Military Actions:** Positional battles continuing under the guise of a truce, or even without an announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. This combined state could last a long time, potentially until the fall or end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

## Internal Purges and Elite Dynamics

Regarding [[internal_russian_political_dynamics_and_changes | internal Russian political dynamics and changes]], the speaker noted that when projects and expectations fail, subordinates are always blamed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. The failure to implement the initial concept of a "limited military operation" was blamed on individuals close to the president who provided information or instilled confidence that Ukraine would "collapse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

Those blamed included:
*   Minister of Defense Shuryga, who reportedly fell into disgrace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
*   The former head of the 5th service of the FSB, responsible for operational information on Ukraine and "behind-the-scenes preparation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Most "bravura reports" came from this service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. This head was reportedly in a pre-trial detention center and subjected to physical abuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
*   A group of officers from the department giving confessions, the nature of which was unknown, but likely obtained under duress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
*   Problems within the Main Directorate of the General Staff (military intelligence) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

There was "no conspiracy" against Putin or split in the elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. Instead, there was "tension and disorganization" that would increase among the security forces once the special military operation ended, regardless of the outcome, as a "purge" would be carried out and culprits punished in the "Russian manner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

Tension and disorganization would also increase among the top bureaucracy and big business for several reasons:
*   **The impending purge:** Described as "settling the score" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.
*   **Strengthening sanctions:** Sanctions would certainly be strengthened, becoming "more and more sensitive" and "difficult for the [[state_of_the_russian_economy | Russian economy]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. This implies a "degradation of the technological degradation of the [[state_of_the_russian_economy | Russian economy]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   **Asset seizure and nationalization discussions:** The fact that Russian oligarchs' assets in the West would not be returned caused nervousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. Additionally, discussions revived among the security environment and people close to the president about the need to nationalize large private assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

## Societal and Political Outlook

The speaker observed "barely noticeable signs of the hatization of the security forces," meaning fears and confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. The highest elites were confused about how to exit the situation, knowing it would worsen and likely lead to a "very sad outcome" for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

Comparing it to the Russian Empire before its collapse, the speaker noted that while the authorities were trying to "tighten the screws" to prevent this process, if the "structure is rusty, the threads are rotten," tightening screws would cause the structure to crumble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. While the structure of the Russian government was not yet crumbling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>, there was a mass feeling of exhaustion for the "Putin era," which was coming to an end, likely not triumphantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.

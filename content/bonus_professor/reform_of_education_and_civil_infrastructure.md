## Education Reform

The speaker's team plans to implement significant [[reforms_and_future_strategies_for_russias_governance_and_social_systems|reforms]] in education and healthcare [11:01]. These [[reforms_and_future_strategies_for_russias_governance_and_social_systems|reforms]] are intended to be "good, understandable" [11:17]. A primary focus will be the reduction of excessive paperwork that currently burdens teachers and doctors [11:23].

Regarding the Unified State Exam (USE), the speaker views it as a "very good method" for ensuring mobility, allowing students from remote regions to access top universities [11:53].

## Civil Infrastructure and Quality of Life

### Salaries and Incomes
There is a plan to increase salaries for essential professionals like teachers, doctors, and Ministry of Emergency Situations employees, making them commensurate with official salaries [10:11]. The current income levels for most Russian citizens are considered "humiliatingly little" [10:30]. The speaker assures that Russia has the necessary funds to increase incomes, pensions, and social payments [10:43].

### Rural Development
While some villages are deemed revivable, the speaker acknowledges that for others, the process might be irreversible or unnecessary [19:21]. However, a broader goal is to inject technology and directly improve the quality of life in rural areas [19:34]. The speaker believes that the Russian people have "earned the right to a decent life" through their labor and dedication, and ensuring this right is a priority [19:40].

### Import Duties on Cars
The new government intends to reduce import duties on used cars from the USA and Japan, acknowledging that current charges are "lawlessness" [21:41]. The initial focus will be on saturating the market and satisfying demand before developing a domestic automobile industry, similar to China's approach [21:55].

### Loan Relief
Following a change in power, individuals with large bank loans can anticipate some relaxation in repayment policies [22:30]. The speaker advises prioritizing family survival over repaying loans, especially if it means depriving oneself or one's children of necessary funds [22:39].

## Governance and Public Trust

### Accountability and Justice
A special service, department, or management will be created to restore the constitutional rights of citizens that have been violated over the past 20-30 years [21:04]. This service will also propose punishments for those guilty of violating these rights [21:28].

### Police System Reform
The speaker acknowledges that the police system is a "huge mass of people" and a complex system that cannot be replaced instantly [20:28]. The approach to change will involve altering the system's rules and its system-forming elements, starting from the top, to gradually change behavior patterns [20:39]. Those who committed crimes against society will be punished [20:55].

### Amnesty
A broad amnesty for political and "near-political" articles is planned after the fall of the current regime [13:42]. This will also include the rehabilitation of individuals who were innocently convicted and suffered [13:49].

### Public Communication
The speaker's team intends to maintain constant and direct feedback with society once in power, contrasting it with the current "humiliating" and "comedic" public communication style, such as the president's direct lines or press conferences [12:25].

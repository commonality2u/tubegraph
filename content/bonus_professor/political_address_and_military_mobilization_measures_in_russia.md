## President Putin's New Year Address (2023)

During the New Year period of 2023, President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin delivered an address to the Russian people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This address was characterized as a "parting word for military action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The speaker, Valery Solovey, advised against reviewing it, describing it as a "clot of negative emotions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

The address reportedly featured Putin with a face "distorted with pain and hatred," where he "promises severe trials" and "predicts that 2023 will be a year of military action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This message was noted as being "hard to call it a New Year's wish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Amendments to Military Mobilization Procedures

In line with the predicted year of military action, measures were being taken to facilitate [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | military mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. On the eve of the New Year, a bill was in its third reading in the State Duma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This legislation aims to make the serving of [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]] summonses legally proper through registered mail with notification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

### New Summons Delivery Process

The new procedure for serving a [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]] summons by registered mail includes:
*   **Notification Receipt** Individuals would find a notice in their mailbox indicating a registered letter is waiting at the post office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **Acknowledgement of Receipt** Upon collecting the letter at the post office, signing for it serves as legal notification of [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Refusal to Accept** If a recipient refuses to take the letter from the postman, the postman's notation of refusal still deems the summons as officially handed over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Similarly, returning an unopened envelope means the summons is considered handed over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

This change implies that receiving a notice for a registered letter should be viewed as a call to "fulfill your patriotic duty," rather than a "letter of happiness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

Speculation surrounding [[putins_reputation_and_physical_health_rumors | Vladimir Putin's health]] has been a significant topic, with information suggesting it influences various aspects of Russian politics and his personal decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. This includes his leadership style, political interactions, and even his approach to potential conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

## Current Health Status and Behavior
Concerns about [[putins_health_and_public_perception | Putin's health]] have been widely discussed, with reports suggesting he doesn't feel very well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. His behavior has occasionally appeared inadequate, with instances of him "raving" for 15-20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:52">[00:52:52]</a>. These episodes are infrequent but have occurred, and efforts are made to prevent them from being publicly visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>. This erratic behavior may be a consequence of potent drugs he is using, which can have unpredictable effects on cognitive function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:14">[00:53:14]</a>.

A recent medical examination involving specialists revealed that "not everything is in order" with his health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>.

### Isolation and Public Appearances
For over a year, Putin has reportedly been isolated in a bunker, afraid to make public appearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. He enforces strict quarantine measures for those around him and severely limits personal access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. This extreme caution is attributed to his serious illness, not merely fear of coronavirus, which is dismissed as propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. His inability to go out is a clear indicator of his physical state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

### Unconventional Treatments
Putin reportedly takes his health issues very seriously and has engaged in unconventional treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>. His current oncology illness is believed by him to be a recurrence of a condition from 2013, which he previously attributed to "magicians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:20">[00:45:20]</a>.

For the past month, he has been using "urinotherapy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:13">[00:46:13]</a>. Furthermore, there are reports that he has participated in shamanic rituals, including drinking the sacrificial blood of a black dog, which he believes is tied to Shoigu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:30">[00:49:30]</a>. The resignation of the head of Tuva was allegedly connected to the leakage of information about these strange practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>.

## Influence on Political Decisions and Foreign Relations
[[vladimir_putins_health_and_political_future | Putin's declining health]] directly impacts his political strategies and interactions with other world leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

### Urgency for Meetings
One of the reasons for Moscow's eagerness to organize a meeting with President Biden is the concern that it may become physically impossible for Putin to meet in person by summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. US intelligence services and President Biden are reportedly fully aware of Putin's health status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, and this knowledge influences their strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:43">[00:54:43]</a>. Western leaders are reportedly willing to wait for the "natural end of his life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>, with Biden's recent outreach viewed as an attempt to "win time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a>. Conversely, Putin is in a hurry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>.

### Impact on Domestic Politics and Succession
[[putins_leadership_and_political_influence | Putin's leadership style]] is characterized by autocracy; he sees himself as the "tsar" and believes everything in Russia, including people's lives and freedoms, is his to control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. This mindset means he believes he can deal with anyone at will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>.

His deteriorating health is forcing him to consider succession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>. The process of choosing a successor is currently a closely guarded secret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>. While there is public discussion about the [[possibility_of_putins_death_and_its_implications | possibility of Putin's death]], many believe that his demise would not fundamentally change the existing system, as another, potentially even more authoritarian, leader would simply take his place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. If a strong, healthy leader were to emerge, the system could even become stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.

### Fear of Protests and Palace Coups
[[putins_political_challenges_and_potential_leadership_changes | Putin is afraid of mass protests]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>. During the January protests, he was reportedly so fearful that he left Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:18">[00:43:18]</a>. The Kremlin closely monitors the dynamics and numbers of people participating in demonstrations, using this information to make decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. He only responds to displays of strength, perceiving weakness as an invitation to apply more pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.

However, he is not afraid of a palace coup, as his inner circle is perceived as absolutely devoted and closely monitored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>. Figures like Yuri Kovalchuk, the Rotenbergs, and Timchenko hold colossal influence over him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>.

## International Perception and Public Knowledge
International intelligence agencies, including those of the US and UK, are reportedly well-informed about [[public_perception_of_putins_health_and_leadership | Putin's health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>. This knowledge shapes their political strategies towards Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:43">[00:54:43]</a>.

Within Russia, there is a perception that people are reluctant to accept the realities of their leader's behavior and health, finding it more comfortable to believe in a different narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">[00:49:55]</a>. The general public is encouraged to believe propaganda that dismisses concerns about his health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.

This article discusses the [[political_dynamics_and_potential_leadership_change_in_russia | political dynamics]] and [[potential_political_changes_and_future_leadership_in_russia | potential leadership changes]] in Russia, particularly in light of a proposed peace deal with Ukraine following Russia's withdrawal from Kherson. The information is presented as an emergency update based on multiple trustworthy sources, confirming a strategic turning point in the armed confrontation between Russia and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

## The Proposed Peace Deal: An Offer of Capitulation

On November 10, 2022, the Kremlin reportedly received an offer of a peace deal with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. This proposal, agreed upon with Ukrainian leadership, is described as a "capitulation of the Russian Federation," not just the Kremlin, but of the country as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

The key conditions of this proposal include:
*   **Complete Withdrawal of Russian Forces:** Russian armed forces must completely leave Ukraine, including the territories of the DPR and LPR, which Russia claims as its subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
*   **Crimea's Status:** The status of Crimea is to be suspended for seven years, during which it will not be discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. The peninsula is to be declared a demilitarized zone, allowing only small arms for police and border guards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. The Black Sea Fleet must leave Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.
*   **Demilitarized Zone:** A demilitarized strip 100 kilometers wide is to be introduced along the borders of Russia with Ukraine and Belarus, with no heavy weapons permitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.
*   **Guarantor Countries:** Six countries have reportedly consented to act as guarantors of this agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.
*   **Transnistria:** Russia must leave Transnistria, meaning the Russian military base, and in 2023, Transnistria will be integrated into Moldova, with Russia undertaking not to interfere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.
*   **Ukraine's NATO Stance:** Ukraine, in return, promises not to join NATO for seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

## Reaction of the Russian Establishment

The initial reaction of the Russian establishment to this "ultimatum" or "offer of capitulation" is positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. This is because the offer provides guarantees of freedom and security to the establishment, including the security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. They are guaranteed that criminal cases will not be brought against them or their family members, and they will not be persecuted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. The top layer, which implements Putin's policy, is promised freedom, security, and the preservation of at least some of their assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

## Putin's Dilemma and Potential Outcomes

The president's reaction is currently unclear; he is thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. Signs indicating his decision include:
*   **Resumption of missile attacks:** If massive missile attacks on Ukrainian critical infrastructure (primarily power plants) resume, it means the president does not accept these conditions, signifying an unambiguous refusal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.
*   **No shelling:** If there is no shelling, it doesn't necessarily mean acceptance but indicates that reflection continues, and an attempt is being made to gain additional time to comprehend the situation and hope for a miracle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.

Regardless of the strategic decision President Putin makes, he will have to leave power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>.

### Acceptance of the Ultimatum

If Putin accepts the ultimatum that the Russian establishment is ready to accept, he will have to go into the shadows to save face and shift responsibility to another person who can sign this "shameful agreement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>. This scenario carries the risk of a palace coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.

### Refusal of the Ultimatum

If the president refuses these conditions and decides in favor of continuing the military campaign, hoping for a miracle, then military action continues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. However, the military defeat of the Russian Federation is very likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. In this case, Putin will inevitably become a scapegoat for the defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>.

### Nuclear Threat and Order Blocking

To delay military defeat, Putin might attempt to use a nuclear threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. However, given the favorable conditions offered to the establishment, the chances increase that an order to use tactical nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction will be blocked or not carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>. Such an event would de facto mean the end of Vladimir Putin's presidency, as a supreme commander-in-chief whose orders are not followed is no longer in command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.

## Conclusion: End of Putin's Rule and Historical Parallels

In any case, a sharp [[potential_political_changes_in_russia_after_putin | turn in Russian politics]] is expected, not only internationally but also internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. This signifies a complete and final fiasco of 22 years of Putin's rule, his policy, and the Putin system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>.

A historical analogy is drawn to Russia's defeat in the Crimean War (1853-1856) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. Emperor Nicholas, who took responsibility for that defeat, believed the Russian army was victorious but realized it was not, and effectively caused his own death by refusing treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>. The present situation marks a period of living in history, which is both fascinating intellectually and terrifying personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>.

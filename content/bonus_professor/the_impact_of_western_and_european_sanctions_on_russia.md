The eighteenth episode of Valery Solovyov's YouTube channel, "What is Happening," discussed several key international developments and their repercussions, particularly regarding Russia. The episode, aired on Monday, June 27, focused on the West's actions, the situation with Lithuania and Kaliningrad, and internal Russian dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Western Support for Ukraine and Moldova

A significant symbolic event in international politics was the granting of candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova for membership in the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>. While actual acceptance into the EU may take many years, this gesture signals the West's readiness to support Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:05">[01:37:05]</a>. This commitment was reinforced by the G7 meeting that same weekend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:09">[01:44:09]</a>.

The move also represents a fundamental shift in Ukraine's civilizational vector, as Ukrainian society has intensively developed and chosen Europe over the [[Russian oligarchs and sanctions | Russian world]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. This shift was, paradoxically, influenced by the Russian Federation and President Putin's actions, which "literally pushed Ukraine out of the potential embrace of the Russian world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. The crucial question for Ukraine's future is not the speed of EU membership, but the quantity and quality of military and political assistance provided by the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:04">[02:45:04]</a>.

## Pressure on Ukraine for Peace and Internal Western Challenges

Despite Western support, there is increasing pressure on Ukraine from assisting countries to agree to a peace treaty with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:02">[03:18:02]</a>. This behind-the-scenes activity is intense, even as leaders like Boris Johnson publicly oppose forcing Ukraine into peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. The push for a peace agreement stems from the [[potential_impacts_on_russian_citizens | internal problems]] faced by countries supporting Ukraine, including issues with gas and the euro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. Germany, for instance, has publicly considered nationalizing part of the Nord Stream pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:04">[04:32:04]</a>.

Other challenges include potential migration flows of refugees, not just from Ukraine but also from North Africa and the Middle East, exacerbated by a theoretical global food crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. This scenario, similar to events from 2015-2017, could see migrants artificially directed towards Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. The current U.S. administration's focus on domestic issues and upcoming midterm elections also contributes to the desire for a resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.

## Lithuania, Kaliningrad, and the Threat of a Second Front

A new potential conflict area has emerged with Lithuania's ban on a significant portion of transit to the Kaliningrad region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. This action is not a provocation by NATO or the European Union, as they are not interested in escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>. Instead, Lithuania's decision was likely an independent act to demonstrate its sovereign status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

Despite Russia's current focus on "force blackmail" rather than direct action, the possibility of conflict is real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. To pressure Lithuania, Russia might involve Belarus in the conflict, with discussions reportedly underway regarding provocations from Belarusian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>. Putin's long-standing aim is to restore the unity of East Slavic countries, reminiscent of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>. Intensive negotiations, involving even foul language, have occurred between Putin and Lukashenko to push Belarus into a real union and involve it in the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>. Lukashenko, while reportedly consenting to Putin's demands, is expected to continue his decades-long strategy of attempting to evade Moscow's full embrace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.

Should Lithuania escalate, NATO would be compelled to use Article 5 of its charter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>. However, the European Union may resort to economic blackmail against Lithuania, threatening to withhold subsidies if it doesn't make concessions regarding Kaliningrad transit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>.

## Potential Southern Front and Changed Perception of Putin

A "Second Front" could also open in the south, along Russia's borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>. The Taliban, previously designated an extremist organization in Russia, appear to have calmed down after allegedly receiving $5 billion in compensation from the Kremlin (partly cash, partly oil supplies) to not invade Tajikistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>. This is critical for Russia, which has concentrated its military efforts in Ukraine, and because Tajikistan and Russia are CSTO members, obligating Russia to intervene if Tajikistan is attacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>.

However, there are reports that Western countries are actively working with the Taliban to push them to strike Tajikistan in August, potentially opening a southern front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>. This aligns with statements from Ukrainian military intelligence predicting a turning point in August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>.

While Putin may be widely disliked, his primary concern, like Emperor Caligula's, is fear rather than popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>. However, the Western establishment, particularly in key European countries, has stopped respecting Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>. This shift occurred not due to the start of the "special military operation" on February 24, but because he "could not and cannot quickly lead this operation to success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>. This lack of success has turned respect into "contempt and mockery" of both the Russian president and the Russian Armed Forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:00">[15:59:00]</a>.

## Russia's Shift to a "Besieged Fortress" Regime

Russia has adapted its strategy from a failed "Blitzkrieg" to preparing for a long confrontation, transitioning to a "besieged fortress" regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a>.

### Ideological Changes and Propaganda

The current ideology of mobilization and constant hysteria related to Ukraine is set to change. By late summer or early autumn, the Kremlin plans to "lower the temperature" and introduce a "new normal" propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:59:00">[16:59:00]</a>. This new message will convey that difficulties are normal, confrontation with the West is traditional, and Russians should find pleasure in their current reality, rather than hoping for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29:00">[17:29:00]</a>.

### Increased Control and Repression

Alongside ideological shifts, practices for controlling society are intensifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:27:00">[18:27:00]</a>:

*   **Expanded "Foreign Agent" Law:** The law on "foreign agents" has been extended to include individuals under "Western influence," which can broadly encompass anyone who has studied a foreign language, toured abroad, or corresponded with foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>. This mirrors Soviet-era practices of suspicion towards Western contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:55:00">[18:55:00]</a>.
*   **Amendments to State Treason Law:** A new amendment means unauthorized contact with a foreigner can be considered "almost treason," punishable by up to 8 years in prison and a million-ruble fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:00">[19:08:00]</a>. This is described as a return to "Stalinist practices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:00">[19:30:00]</a>.
*   **Selective Exit Visas:** There is a "selective introduction of exit visas," preventing certain individuals from leaving Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>. An example is the prominent director Sakurov being denied exit for a conference in Milan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:44:00">[20:44:00]</a>. The implied punishment is being forced to remain in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:18:00">[21:18:00]</a>.

These repressive measures do not need mass application; modern media allows isolated cases to be publicized, creating a multiplier effect that instills fear and conformity throughout society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:00">[19:41:00]</a>.

## Kremlin's Reliance on Esoteric Practices

The Russian authorities' confidence in their success is questioned, as they are reportedly resorting to "magical rituals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:00">[21:51:00]</a>. A "black magic ritual" was conducted on June 22, the summer solstice, at 4 AM (the time the war began on February 24) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:10:00">[22:10:00]</a>. This ritual was intended to grant victory to the Russian army and strengthen Putin's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:41:00">[22:41:00]</a>.

## Oligarchs and the Kremlin

A rumored coalition of oligarchs, including Deripaska, Abramovich, Potanin, and Chubais, is reportedly forming against the security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:35:00">[23:35:00]</a>. Oleg Deripaska's quick and sarcastic public rebuke of these claims suggests their veracity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:58:00">[23:58:00]</a>. In political analysis, a hasty refutation often indicates a degree of truth to the accusation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:22:00">[24:22:00]</a>.

A "strategic turning point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a> in the armed confrontation between Russia and Ukraine has occurred in Ukraine's favor. This is supported by "sensational news" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a> received from "several trustworthy sources" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

## The "Peace Deal" Ultimatum

On Thursday, November 10, the Kremlin received an offer of a peace deal with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. This proposal, agreed upon with the Ukrainian leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>, is essentially a "proposal for the capitulation of the Russian Federation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. It signifies the capitulation of the entire country, not just the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

The essence of the proposal includes several key demands and conditions:
*   **Withdrawal of Forces:** Russian armed forces must completely leave Ukraine, including the territories of the DPR and LPR, which Russia claims as subjects of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
*   **Crimea Status:** The status of Crimea is suspended for seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. During this period, it will not be discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. The peninsula will be declared a demilitarized zone, allowing only police and border guards with small arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. The Black Sea Fleet must leave Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.
*   **Demilitarized Strip:** A 100-kilometer-wide demilitarized strip will be introduced along Russia's borders with Ukraine and Belarus, with no heavy weapons permitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.
*   **Transnistria:** Russia must leave Transnistria, specifically its military base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. Transnistria is to be integrated into Moldova in 2023, and Russia undertakes not to interfere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   **Ukraine's Promise:** In return, Ukraine promises not to join NATO for seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

## Reaction to the Ultimatum

### Russian Establishment
The initial reaction from the Russian establishment to this ultimatum has been positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. The reason for this favorable response is that the ultimatum guarantees freedom and security to the establishment, including security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. They are assured that no criminal cases will be brought against them or their families, and they will not be persecuted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. This includes the top layer responsible for implementing Putin's policy, who are promised security and the preservation of at least some of their assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.

### Putin's Reaction
President Putin's reaction is currently unclear; he is still considering the proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.
*   **Refusal Indication:** If Russia resumes massive missile attacks on Ukrainian critical infrastructure, particularly power plants, this would signal an unambiguous refusal of the conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.
*   **Continued Reflection:** If there is no shelling, it doesn't necessarily mean acceptance, but it indicates that reflection continues, and an attempt is being made to gain additional time to comprehend the situation and hope for a "miracle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.

## Potential Consequences

### If Putin Rejects the Ultimatum
If President Putin refuses the conditions that the Russian establishment is ready to accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>:
*   **Continued Military Action and Defeat:** Military action will continue, making a [[implications_of_a_potential_russian_military_defeat | military defeat]] of the Russian Federation "highly probable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>.
*   **Nuclear Threat:** Putin's only way to delay the inevitable defeat would be to try to contain it with a nuclear threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.
*   **Blocked Orders:** However, the chances increase that an order to use tactical nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction would be blocked or not carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.
*   **End of Presidency:** Such disobedience would de facto mean the end of Vladimir Putin's presidency, as a supreme commander-in-chief whose orders are not followed is no longer in charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.
*   **Scapegoat:** If he decides to continue the military campaign hoping for a miracle, he will "inevitably become a scapegoat" for its defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>.

### If Putin Accepts the Ultimatum
If Putin accepts the ultimatum:
*   **Resignation:** He would have to "go into the shadows later" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a> to save face and shift responsibility to another person who would sign the "shameful agreement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>. This scenario carries the risk of a palace coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.

### Broader Implications
Regardless of Putin's decision, there will be a "sharp turn" in Russian politics, both internationally and domestically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. This would signify a "complete final fiasco" of 22 years of Putin's rule, policy, and system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>.

A historical analogy is drawn to Russia's defeat in the Crimean War (1853-1856) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. Emperor Nicholas, who took responsibility for that defeat, died from inflammation after refusing treatment upon realizing the Russian army was not victorious, effectively killing himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>.

The situation is developing "faster and faster," and while it is fascinating as an intellectual, it is "terribly scary" as an ordinary person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>. However, there is hope that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>.

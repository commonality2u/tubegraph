Valery Solovey, in the 85th episode of his program, discusses the potential for a [[potential_strategic_turning_points_in_the_conflict | shift in Russia's military course]] towards a peaceful resolution, the implications of economic sanctions, and the broader geopolitical context. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>

## Potential Shift in Military Course

The speaker addresses the question of whether there will be a noticeable shift in the military course after December 15, potentially leading to a truce. While "Hawks" in Russia desired to extend their "Carte Blanche" until at least January 20, they did not receive consent for this. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> Nevertheless, they will attempt to extend their influence, potentially laying down elements of provocation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>

Despite these efforts, there is "very serious hope" that after December 15, the [[military_strategy_and_developments | military course]] of the Russian Federation will begin to "gradually shift in the direction of finding a peaceful solution." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> Some cautious but tangible steps are already being taken in this direction, even at the fronts. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>

### Probability of Hostilities Ending

The speaker estimates the probability of:
*   A stop in hostilities by the end of this year: Unlikely (1-25%). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:24">[00:47:24]</a>
*   A stop in hostilities by the end of January 2025: Higher than low (25-45%). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>

If a truce is achieved, even if it involves returning part of the territory to Ukraine in exchange for Ukraine joining NATO, it would be a positive outcome for Ukraine as it would end the killing of its citizens and allow people to return home and begin peaceful life. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a> A truce is considered "not the end of the road," but its beginning, with the ultimate ending likely to be different from initial agreements. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>

## Economic and Societal Implications of Geopolitical Shifts

### Sanctions and Economic Survivability
The [[militarypolitical_situation_in_russia_and_ukraine | Russian political and economic system]] has continued despite "destructive terminal sanctions" imposed almost three years ago. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a> The survivability factors include:
*   **Gradual Sanctions**: Sanctions were not imposed immediately, allowing the Russian economy and politics to adapt. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>
*   **Safety Margin**: The safety margin of the Russian economy was "much higher than expected." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>
*   **People's Patience**: The "notorious and long-suffering people" of the Russian Federation have repeatedly helped the authorities to navigate problems and survive crises. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a> This patience is now believed to be "on the verge of exhaustion." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>

The speaker notes that experts do not place primary hopes on the people's patience running out for significant changes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>

### Freezing Deposits and Financial Crisis
The financial and banking system in Russia is in a "catastrophic state." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a> Freezing deposits and accounts is considered an "uncontested" and "only alternative" solution, regardless of who is in power. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a> It's possible to soften the freezing conditions, but it will happen. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>

*   **Impact on Economy**: This measure is intended to "fill the economic vessels with money blood." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>
*   **Brokerage Accounts**: Brokerage accounts are likely to be frozen to prevent money transfers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>
*   **Real Estate**: The real estate market will experience stagnation, and banks will still demand mortgage and loan payments. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>
*   **Pensions and Salaries**: Pensions and salaries will still be paid to cards, and people will be able to withdraw and use within introduced limits. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a> However, a cash shortage is a "real possibility," potentially leading to delayed payments as seen in the 1990s. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>
*   **Denomination**: Denomination of the ruble is not expected to be simultaneous with the freezing of deposits; it would happen much later. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>
*   **Dollar Deposits**: Dollar deposits will also be frozen. Automatic conversion to rubles at the Central Bank rate is not excluded, depending on the chosen freezing option and the severity of the crisis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>

If the government changes before summer as planned, a "vegetarian option" for freezing deposits will be chosen, in which case the "overwhelming majority of the country's population will not suffer." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:03">[00:45:03]</a> However, if implemented sooner and according to a "tough," even "cruel" scenario, many will suffer. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>

### Elite Discontent and Internal Conflicts
The discontent within the elite is not solely caused by ongoing [[military_and_geopolitical_issues_involving_russia_and_its_neighbors | military actions]]; there are fundamental differences concerning Russia's future development and ideology. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a> Existing contradictions, which have been present for a long time, are now surfacing and are of an "irreconcilable and insurmountable nature" within the framework of the "Putin model." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>

The speaker asserts that the current internal dynamics offer a chance to direct Russia in a "right positive direction" for the first time in its history, in the interests of society and the country, rather than specific groups. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>

### International Relations and Hybrid Warfare
Damage to underwater cables in the Baltic Sea is identified as an "element of a hybrid impact on European countries," part of a "hybrid war." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>

Russia's European assets are considered "irretrievably lost" because, during consultations, a mutual decision was made for compensation to be paid to Ukraine from these frozen assets. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>

## Post-Change of Power
If a new government comes to power, several changes are anticipated:
*   **Legal Reform**: A corresponding legal reform will take place, including a "total illustration of the judicial corps." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>
*   **Political Prisoners**: All political prisoners and innocently convicted individuals will be released and receive full rehabilitation, including financial. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a> A special agency will be created to restore violated constitutional rights. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>
*   **Propagandists**: Propagandists will face criminal responsibility and may be extradited to an international tribunal in The Hague. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a> The speaker believes they should end up in the clutches of "Basmanny justice," implying a more severe domestic punishment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>
*   **Informers**: The names of all informers will be published, and they will be held accountable, including financially compensating material losses to their victims. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>
*   **Television**: Television will not disappear but its "vector of activity" and propaganda will change by 180 degrees, beginning to tell the truth "on command." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>
*   **Return of Emigrants**: The "overwhelming majority" of people who left Russia due to military action and the Putin regime will return. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a> They will find a "fundamentally different" and "New Russia" that offers opportunities previously unavailable. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14">[00:38:14]</a>
*   **Economic Recovery**: While political changes will bring a sense of freedom, "socio-economic improvement" will only be noticeable in about a year due to "colossal inertia." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a> Recovering from the crisis will take "at least 2 years." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>
*   **Sanctions Lifting**: Even after a truce, sanctions will not be lifted immediately. The process of lifting sanctions, though fast, will take months, and some measures will take years. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>
*   **Furgal's Fate**: Sergei Furgal, a political prisoner, will be released and his appointment to a post is under discussion. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>

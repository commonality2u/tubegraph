Professor [[valery_solovievs_political_analysis | Valery Solovyov]] announced that he was declared a [[foreign_agents_and_influence_in_russia | foreign agent]] by the [[foreign_agents_and_influence_in_russia | Ministry of Justice]] on December 2, 2022, a decision he is challenging in court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. He views this designation as an inclusion into a list of the "best daughters and sons of [[foreign_agents_and_influence_in_russia | Russia]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Reasons for Designation
The [[foreign_agents_and_influence_in_russia | Ministry of Justice]] provided two primary reasons for Solovyov's designation as a [[foreign_agents_and_influence_in_russia | foreign agent]]:
1.  **YouTube Monetization** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>: Solovyov enabled monetization on his YouTube videos, allowing YouTube to place advertisements from which he received income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. He stated that this was his only source of income at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This charge was also reportedly the basis for Yuri Dud's inclusion on the [[foreign_agents_and_influence_in_russia | foreign agent]] list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
2.  **Seminar and Conference Fees** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>: He received fees two or three times from a small Western research institute for participating in their seminars and conferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Solovyov noted that receiving fees and travel expense coverage for participating in Western academic events is a common practice in the academic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

During the court hearing on December 2, Solovyov's lawyer questioned the connection between YouTube monetization and his political videos, asking how the advertising income influenced his views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. The [[foreign_agents_and_influence_in_russia | Ministry of Justice]], however, does not require establishing a cause-and-effect relationship; merely the fact of receiving foreign financing is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## Implications for Russian Bloggers
Solovyov asserts that this criterion makes it easy to designate almost any [[foreign_agents_and_influence_in_russia | Russian]] blogger as a [[foreign_agents_and_influence_in_russia | foreign agent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. He illustrates this with an example: a culinary blogger who states that dumplings, considered a [[foreign_agents_and_influence_in_russia | Russian]] national dish, are actually borrowed from China, and who receives YouTube monetization, could be accused of humiliating their country and tradition, thus becoming a [[foreign_agents_and_influence_in_russia | foreign agent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

## Solovyov's Definition of a "Foreign Agent" in Russia
Professor Solovyov offered a stark contrast between those designated as [[foreign_agents_and_influence_in_russia | foreign agents]] and those considered "true patriots" in [[foreign_agents_and_influence_in_russia | Russia]]:

> "In order to be a [[foreign_agents_and_influence_in_russia | foreigner]], you only need one thing: love your homeland and try to protect it, do the best for your people, then you are on the [[foreign_agents_and_influence_in_russia | Agent]]. And if you rob your homeland If you buy stolen goods, build villas, don't build, buy villas on the Cote d'Azur near Lake Como If you buy real estate, open multi-million dollar accounts in Western banks and offshore companies then you are a true patriot of [[foreign_agents_and_influence_in_russia | Russia]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

He concludes that there are "agents" who protect the [[foreign_agents_and_influence_in_russia | Russian]] people versus "real Patriots" who are in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

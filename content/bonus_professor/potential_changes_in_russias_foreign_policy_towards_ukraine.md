Russian political scientist Valery Solovey discusses various aspects concerning [[Potential changes in Russias political landscape | Russia's political landscape]] and its foreign policy towards Ukraine amidst internal and external crises.

## Current Kremlin Expectations
The Kremlin believes that circumstances concerning Ukraine are unfolding favorably from its perspective [00:23:26]. There is an expectation that Ukraine will soon seek assistance from Russia [00:23:43]. This belief is supported by preparatory work conducted with a number of Ukrainian officials [00:23:55]. Russia has extended medical aid to countries like Italy and Serbia and indicates a readiness to provide similar assistance to Ukraine [00:24:14]. Discussions are reportedly underway regarding the provision of such aid under protection [00:24:31]. Despite various developments, Russia's core intentions regarding Ukraine remain entirely consistent [00:24:41], and there is no indication that these intentions will change [00:24:43].

## Role of Ukrainian Officials in Negotiations
Moscow had placed significant trust in figures like Ukrainian official Yermak to act as a "Sherpa" for Kremlin influence in Ukrainian politics [00:26:07]. The Kremlin was reportedly very pleased with Yermak's conduct during a meeting in Oman [00:25:54], and believed he could help in "drinking the edges" of Ukrainian political hysteria [00:26:10]. However, there is dissatisfaction in Moscow regarding his current position, particularly in light of a scandal involving Yermak's brother, which is believed to have been leaked by the same forces that informed Saudi Arabia about the Kremlin's alleged involvement in the Khashoggi case [00:26:25]. Moscow is now contemplating who could serve as a contact if Yermak's position becomes untenable [00:26:17].

## Impact of Russian Domestic Crisis on Donbas Policy
A severe internal crisis in Russia could significantly reduce its interest in the Donbas region [00:48:53]. While it's uncertain if Russia would completely abandon its presence in Donbas, it is expected that active engagement in the Ukrainian direction would cease [00:49:04]. The depth and scale of Russia's internal crisis will ultimately determine its actions, as all resources would be needed domestically [00:49:11].

## Donbas as an Electoral Resource
The Donbas region is considered an important electoral resource for Russia, particularly due to the presence of people holding Russian passports who have the right to vote [00:49:26]. These individuals participated in the plebiscite on constitutional amendments [00:49:38]. The number of Russian passport holders in Donbas is reportedly aimed to reach one million [00:49:48], up from several hundred thousand and an earlier figure of 150,000 [00:50:24]. This population is viewed as a highly manageable electoral base [00:50:04]. However, the use of votes from the ORT (Occupied Regions of Ukraine) territory for Russian constitutional changes is considered illegal by some [00:50:31].

## Risk of Military Offensive in Donbas
There is a potential for a Russian military offensive in Donbas if Russia deems it necessary to exert pressure on the Ukrainian leadership or to divert public attention from internal problems within Russia [00:52:05]. This period, as the internal crisis unfolds, presents a significant threat of war [00:52:26].

## US Election Influence
The results of the US elections are considered quite important for Russia, as Putin desires a Trump victory [00:52:42]. He is expected to try and assist Trump's campaign [00:52:46], potentially by leveraging information provided by his "Ukrainian friends" regarding the Biden family's interests in Ukraine [00:52:51]. Such information is reportedly being collected and documented for strategic release [00:53:12], which could be a significant aid to Trump [00:53:41].

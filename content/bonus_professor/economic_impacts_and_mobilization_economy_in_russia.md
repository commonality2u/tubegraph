The Russian government is implementing measures indicating a shift towards a [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization]] model for its economy, impacting businesses and citizens alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>. This shift is compared to the economic conditions in the Soviet Union prior to June 1941 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:59">[09:58:59]</a>.

## Shift Towards a Mobilization Economy
The government has presented draft amendments to federal law to the State Duma, seeking the right to introduce "special measures" in the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>. These measures are designed to support Russia's armed actions outside the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>:
*   **Mandatory Government Orders** Firms, organizations, and enterprises, regardless of their form of ownership, will be prohibited from refusing government orders and contracts related to military operations and servicing the armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. Businesses will be obligated to supply goods, perform work, and provide services for military purposes abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.
*   **Contractual Interference** Authorities will have the power to change the terms of contracts during their implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>.
*   **Labor Relations Interference** The government can interfere with labor relations within organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. Employees can be compelled to work at night, on weekends, and holidays, and without vacations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. The government has declared that citizens will "work around the clock and without days off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

## Broader [[economic_and_social_consequences_in_russia | Economic Consequences]] and [[financial_and_societal_impacts_of_mobilization | Societal Impacts]]
The Kremlin's increasing efforts in its military operations are leading to Russia's depletion of material, human, moral, and psychological resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>. This continuous push is causing Russia to roll back along the path of social, technological, and [[economic_and_social_consequences_in_russia | economic degradation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>.

### Impact on Investors
Gazprom's refusal to pay dividends, the first time since 1998, is viewed as a direct order from the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:04:00">[20:04:00]</a>. This action signals that private investors are considered "freeloaders" and that their investments or property rights in Russia are not recognized or protected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:00">[20:31:00]</a>. The state is demonstrating that nothing belongs to private investors and never will, especially as the regime transitions towards a [[mobilization_process_in_recession | mobilization economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41:00">[20:41:00]</a>.

### Future Outlook
The shift to a [[mobilization_process_in_recession | mobilization economy]] implies anticipated restrictions, harshness, simplification, and increased pressure on Russian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:57:00">[20:57:00]</a>.

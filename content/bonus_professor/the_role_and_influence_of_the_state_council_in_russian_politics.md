The State Council is being positioned as a central element in a new configuration of power in Russia, aiming to ensure stability post-transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. This emerging structure is designed to manage the [[russian_internal_political_dynamics | political figures and power dynamics in Russia]] within a non-democratic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

## Historical Precedent and Future Role
Historically, the Security Council was believed to play the role of the Politburo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. However, in the new configuration of power currently being prepared for implementation in the fall, the State Council is intended to become the "new Politburo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>.

## Mechanism for Stability
In the absence of a true separation of powers, stability in the Russian Federation is maintained through the differentiation of influence among opposing elite groups and the assurance of mutual deterrence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. This involves placing one's people to control specific spheres and using the risk of mutual destruction (or paralysis) to prevent any single group from seizing full power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

A "negotiating platform" or a "moderator and coordinator of the system" is essential for this arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>, a role that was previously filled by "the late Putin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. This role is now assigned to the State Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. It is intended to be the place where the "Key Russian Elite will be united" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>, fostering a system of checks and balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.

## Leadership Scenarios
The proposed leadership of the State Council depends on the broader power configuration:
*   **If [[political_figures_and_power_dynamics_in_russia | Dmitry Patrushev]] becomes president** in early elections, the State Council is planned to be headed by [[political_figures_and_power_dynamics_in_russia | Viktor Chemezov]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. This arrangement was agreed upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. This allows the Patrushev coalition to gain presidential power, while [[political_figures_and_power_dynamics_in_russia | Chemezov]]'s coalition restrains it through control of the State Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.
*   **If the situation does not develop as [[political_figures_and_power_dynamics_in_russia | Nikolai Patrushev]] desires**, then [[political_figures_and_power_dynamics_in_russia | Nikolai Patrushev]] himself will head the State Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>.

## Secretary of the State Council
The appointment of [[political_figures_and_power_dynamics_in_russia | Alexei Dyumin]] as Secretary of the State Council is seen as a symptom of the formation of this new power configuration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. It is important to note that [[political_figures_and_power_dynamics_in_russia | Dyumin]] is only the Secretary, not the head, as the State Council is led by its Chairman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>. His functionality and capabilities will ultimately depend on the overall significance of the State Council itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>. If the State Council indeed becomes the new Politburo, the role of its Secretary will be very significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>. [[political_figures_and_power_dynamics_in_russia | Dyumin]] reportedly has good relations with both [[political_figures_and_power_dynamics_in_russia | Chemezov]] and [[political_figures_and_power_dynamics_in_russia | Patrushev]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>.

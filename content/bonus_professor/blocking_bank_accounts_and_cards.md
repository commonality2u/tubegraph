Questions have arisen regarding the possible [[freezing_of_bank_deposits | blocking of bank accounts and cards]] for Russian citizens, particularly in relation to the upcoming second stage of mobilization [00:00:58]. This concern is widespread, with typical questions inquiring if salary cards would also be blocked [00:01:27].

## Legal Basis and Effectiveness

While the amendments to the law on the creation of a single register of military personnel do not explicitly include a restriction on bank accounts and cards [00:01:55], they do list other [[restrictions_and_measures_taken_by_the_government | restrictions and measures taken by the government]], such as a ban on traveling to the border, real estate transactions, registering or operating as an individual entrepreneur, and driving a car [00:02:06].

However, these existing restrictions are deemed insufficient to compel people to report to military registration and enlistment offices [00:02:21]. Many citizens may not possess foreign passports or cars, or operate as individual entrepreneurs [00:02:30]. Furthermore, there is currently no criminal punishment for evading mobilization in the Criminal Code, and no one was administratively or criminally punished for evasion during the initial "partial mobilization" [00:03:10].

## The Most Effective Measure

The speaker asserts that the easiest and most effective way to force people to comply with mobilization is to [[potential_economic_crisis_and_freeze_on_deposits_and_accounts | block their bank accounts and cards]] [00:03:34]. These accounts would only be unblocked once an individual reports to the military registration and enlistment office [00:03:42]. The unblocking would be accompanied by promises of financial compensation for service, although the speaker expresses skepticism about these payments [00:04:02].

This measure was likely not included in the law due to its high effectiveness [00:04:47]. The banking system is reportedly prepared for such a scenario, with Nabiullina (head of the Central Bank of Russia) having prepared for [[freezing_of_bank_deposits_in_russia | blocking accounts and cards]] since September of the previous year based on presidential instructions [00:05:01]. It is anticipated that this blocking might not apply to everyone, but specifically to those who receive electronic summonses or appeals, aiming to create a "multiplier effect" [00:05:15].

## Recommendations for Preparedness

Individuals are advised to stock up on personal cash [00:05:50], echoing [[recommendations_for_financial_and_personal_preparedness_amidst_crisis | recommendations for financial and personal preparedness amidst crisis]]. Those already living with debt restrictions (e.g., for loans or alimony) are cited as examples of navigating such limitations [00:05:40]. The authorities are not concerned with individual work or financial stability, and people should prepare to adapt to difficult circumstances [00:06:01].

## Martial Law and Movement Restrictions

In the event of martial law, it is expected that borders would not be completely closed for all categories of citizens [00:06:37]. Instead, [[closure_of_borders_and_restrictions_on_movement | movement restrictions]] would likely apply to those in the database of individuals potentially subject to mobilization, which currently numbers around 15 million and is rapidly expanding [00:06:42]. Everyone else would likely be able to enter and leave the Russian Federation [00:06:57]. Martial law also includes a ban on movement between regions within Russia [00:12:39].

## Evasion and Traps

Currently, there is no criminal liability for evading mobilization, and it is unlikely to appear [00:07:49]. The strategy is not to "hunt for everyone" but to set "traps" in busy public places [00:08:43]. These locations include train stations, busy metro stations in large cities, and potentially supermarkets in smaller and medium-sized cities [00:08:52]. Police patrols and military enlistment office personnel would be present to intercept potential conscripts [00:09:07]. Those who receive an electronic summons are particularly at risk [00:12:24]. It is advised to avoid areas of high traffic if attempting to evade [00:22:01].

## Conscript Contracts and Students

There is an expectation that conscripts might be pressured to sign contracts for military service almost immediately upon entering service, rather than after the previous three-month period [00:09:31]. To prevent this, individuals are advised not to sign anything and to contact lawyers [00:10:00].

Students, including those on correspondence, full-time, and part-time courses, generally have the right to a deferment [00:10:26]. However, students who are graduates (e.g., completing bachelor's or master's degrees) are in a risk group [00:10:37]. While their deferment formally extends until September 1, it has been ignored in some cases [00:10:53]. Therefore, graduates should secure a master's degree program or employment with an enterprise that provides a reservation to avoid conscription [00:11:00].

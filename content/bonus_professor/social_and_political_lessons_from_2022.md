The year 2023 is predicted to be a year of "military action" and "severe trials," making the phrase "Today we are alive and this is our happiness" a potentially relevant motto for Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

On the eve of the New Year, a bill in the State Duma, in its third reading, allows for summonses for [[social_and_national_implications_of_mobilization | mobilization]] to be legally served by registered mail with notification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. This means if a notice for a registered letter is received, and the recipient goes to the post office and signs for it, they are considered notified of [[social_and_political_implications_of_mobilization_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. Even if the letter is taken and then refused or not opened, the summons is considered handed over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. This legislation is a "letter calling on you to fulfill your patriotic duty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

The speaker presents "Seven Lessons" from 2022, which are described as personal but of public interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. These lessons, framed as "mind of cold observations and the heart of sorrowful notes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>, offer an "optics" through which to examine the [[future_predictions_and_societal_impact | future]] in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.

## Seven Lessons from 2022

### Lesson 1: Misunderstanding Russian Society
Russian society is not well understood, and many have been surprised by the behavior of compatriots over the past year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. This misunderstanding stems from two fundamental factors:
*   **Inaccuracy and Falsification of Data:** Sociology and statistics are deeply falsified within Russian society, creating a problem even for the authorities themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. As an example, in 2019, when the leadership requested real voting data for the ruling party, the response was that the system of falsification was so ramified that the true ratio of political sympathies was unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.
*   **Intellectual Weakness:** The intellectual class, particularly those professionally engaged in analysis, often struggles to understand and draw conclusions from what is directly before them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. The "Putin system" has always been "in plain sight," yet it was not understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.

### Lesson 2: Intellectual Weakness and Domestic Mentality
The intellectual weakness identified in Lesson 1 is tied to two defects in the "domestic mentality":
*   **Poor Knowledge of Domestic History:** Understanding historical analogies is crucial for forecasting, especially during a crisis, as it provides a more accurate method than extrapolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. Events can radically change the course of life, and history shows such events can repeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.
*   **Weak Imagination:** Serious analysis and the desire for change require imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>. There is a need to imagine things that seem unthinkable or previously unimaginable to expand intellectual frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>. Both the political class and Russian intellectuals lack the imagination to envision a different Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>. This lack of imagination leads to limitations in knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>. An example of this inability to imagine is the leadership's reported attempts to find the mythical Shambhala <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>.

### Lesson 3: Russian Society's Adaptability
Russian society is highly flexible and adaptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:00">[15:49:00]</a>. This adaptability is a strength for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>. However, it is also a weakness because society quickly gets used to bad conditions, begins to endure the unbearable, and settles into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:00">[16:08:00]</a>.

### Lesson 4: Moralism and Lack of Distinction Between Good and Evil
The other side of this plasticity is the "moralism" of society, which signifies being "Beyond good and evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:25:00">[16:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>. Russians are capable of "literally everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>. A significant part of the population does not differentiate between good and evil, making them amoral, not evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03:00">[17:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>. This allows them to be led towards either good or bad outcomes with equal success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>. Currently, a significant part of society follows a path of "submissive fatalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:23:00">[17:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:00">[17:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>.

### Lesson 5: Contradictory Mental State of Society
The mental state of Russian society is highly contradictory, characterized by deep depression and apathy alongside agitation and high readiness for aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:39:00">[17:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:41:00">[17:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:43:00">[17:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:47:00">[17:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>. There is a deep need to return to normalcy, as the current state is perceived as deeply abnormal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">[18:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:23:00">[18:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:25:00">[18:25:00]</a>. After negative emotions and tension are "splashed out" on a global or national scale, society may move in the opposite direction if led there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:38:00">[18:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:00">[18:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:44:00">[18:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:00">[18:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:58:00">[18:58:00]</a>. This relates to the idea that "people grass, rulers wind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:00">[19:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>. These [[social_and_political_changes_in_russia | social and political changes in Russia]] and [[public_perception_and_potential_triggers_for_sociopolitical_change_in_russia | public perception and potential triggers for sociopolitical change in Russia]] are observed.

### Lesson 6: Resilience of the Russian Economy
The Russian economy demonstrated stability in 2022, resisting collapse despite degradation, mistakes, crimes, and sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:32:00">[19:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:36:00">[19:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:38:00">[19:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:42:00">[19:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:18:00">[20:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>. Its adaptability suggests a capability for rapid, even long-term, restorative growth if external interference ceases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:59:00">[19:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:04:00">[20:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:00">[20:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">[20:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:27:00">[20:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:29:00">[20:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:32:00">[20:32:00]</a>. The stability of the banking system is maintained through competent efforts of bureaucrats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:12:00">[22:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:14:00">[22:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:17:00">[22:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:19:00">[22:19:00]</a>.

### Lesson 7: Competent Personnel Serving "Evil"
Last year, "final stability" in Russia was ensured by the competent efforts of senior government officials and bureaucrats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:55:00">[20:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:58:00">[20:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:59:00">[20:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:01:00">[21:01:00]</a>. While their existence is good news, the negative aspect is that these competent individuals "serve evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:15:00">[21:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:00">[21:24:00]</a>. This highlights the "moralism" of society (Lesson 4), where officials, like the average Russian, are conformist and will bend to where the ruler directs them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:27:00">[21:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:34:00">[21:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:37:00">[21:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:40:00">[21:40:00]</a>. There is a possibility that these individuals could serve a "good cause" or "go over to the right side of history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:45:00">[21:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:47:00">[21:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:00">[21:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:55:00">[21:55:00]</a>. The future of the financial system, for example, depends on political factors interfering with economic processes, and the likelihood of these factors being destructive is high in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:33:00">[22:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:37:00">[22:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:40:00">[22:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:45:00">[22:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:00">[22:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:56:00">[22:56:00]</a>. This indicates that [[future_political_and_social_changes_in_russia | future political and social changes in Russia]] and [[future_political_changes_and_the_role_of_international_relations | the role of international relations]] will be significant in determining the [[impact_of_political_changes_on_daily_life | impact of political changes on daily life]].

The speaker concludes by urging self-care, as the need to do so will become an imperative in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:09:00">[24:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:13:00">[24:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:15:00">[24:15:00]</a>. The year 2023 is presented as a time when "we can change our destiny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:27:00">[24:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:30:00">[24:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:33:00">[24:33:00]</a>.

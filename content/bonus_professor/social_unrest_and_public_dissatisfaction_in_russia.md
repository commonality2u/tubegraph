The internal political and social atmosphere in Russia is characterized by growing discontent and a sense of instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">00:00:42</a>. Public sentiment suggests a "sea is already starting to worry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">00:00:42</a>, indicating significant [[public_discontent_and_political_dynamics_in_russia | public dissatisfaction]].

## Perceived Governmental Incompetence and Lack of Power

Despite claims of stability from the Russian president, critics argue that decisions are poorly executed due to a lack of a clear "vertical of power" in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">00:01:43</a>. Everything is described as "neither shaky nor shaky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">00:01:53</a>, with officials often looking away, except for a small, interconnected group "welded together by one chain and tied by common blood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">00:01:58</a>, who understand their precarious position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">00:02:13</a>.

Mikhail Delyagin, a commentator, has harshly described the Russian government as "female able gangs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">00:03:18</a>, highlighting the shift in rhetoric within communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">00:03:24</a>.

The speaker notes that the public generally struggles to grasp the true severity of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">00:03:38</a>, suggesting that the reality is so dire it could "damage the psyche" to fully comprehend "who ruled Russia and how" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">00:04:09</a>.

## Economic Hardship and Ineffective Aid

A significant source of [[public_discontent_and_political_dynamics_in_russia | public discontent]] stems from economic struggles and what is perceived as inadequate government response.

### Mortgages and Financial Aid
President Vladimir Putin declared the need for citizens to receive mortgages at 6.5% per annum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">00:08:37</a>. However, experts question how this is feasible when the national currency collapses by 30% after certain events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">00:09:28</a>, and the Central Bank disavows responsibility for currency rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">00:09:34</a>. The impression given is that the government "can't think of anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">00:09:54</a> and is trying to offer solutions without using budget money, which they consider their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">00:10:02</a>.

Promises of cheap loans and mortgages are viewed with skepticism, likely to be accompanied by "difficulty fulfilled" conditions that few will meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">00:10:36</a>. Banks are unwilling to follow presidential orders if unprofitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">00:11:15</a>. This highlights a disconnect between the president's will and its execution, demonstrating that the state is effective at "beating on the head with truncheons" and "taking bribes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">00:11:29</a>, but not at providing or building systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">00:11:37</a>.

### Comparison with US Aid
The lack of financial support is starkly contrasted with other nations. In the US, citizens received $1200 as aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">00:12:40</a>, while in Russia, businesses were only promised support *after* quarantine, based on registered employees, implying people must "live on this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">00:12:56</a>.

### Minimum Wage and Poverty
The discussion also touched on the minimum subsistence level, with an emphasis that people should be made to live on it, rather than face medieval punishments like hanging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">00:02:27</a>. The statement that 60-65% of Russian families did not have enough money for a month, even before the current crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">00:36:03</a>, underscores the dire economic situation.

## COVID-19 Response and Public Opinion

[[Public opinion and political shifts in Russia | Public opinion]] regarding the epidemic and government response is divided:
*   30% believe authorities are hiding the true picture, underestimating infected and deceased numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">00:17:05</a>.
*   29% believe official data is correct and reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">00:17:18</a>.
*   28% believe the virus threat is exaggerated and used by authorities to cover up their "sins and affairs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">00:17:47</a>, such as the loss in OPEC+ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">00:18:10</a>.

The approval of self-isolation has decreased by 10% in a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">00:18:17</a>. Sociology reports used by the presidential administration are rumored to be "frightening" due to their negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">00:18:41</a>.

### Ineffective Management of Restrictions
The widely announced pass system in Moscow led to huge queues at the metro entrance and traffic jams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">00:13:19</a>, despite independent bloggers finding no police cars checking passes the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">00:13:30</a>. This highlights a fundamental misunderstanding of "how life is arranged" by management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">00:14:22</a>, as "to manage means to foresee" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">00:14:30</a>.

Local police are fining people small amounts like 500 rubles in rural areas for seemingly minor infractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">00:12:08</a>, while taking 25,000 rubles in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">00:12:13</a>. This demonstrates a state that can only "humiliate people and take from them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">00:12:26</a>.

### Criticism of Moscow's Mayor
Moscow Mayor Sobyanin's decisions have faced sharp criticism. His sudden closure of construction sites, after initially declaring their importance to the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">00:23:33</a>, was heavily criticized by Aras Agalarov of Crocus City Hall. Agalarov warned of severe consequences for the epidemic among workers living in "prison conditions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">00:23:55</a>. The mayor's office is seen as further tightening "the regime of detention of citizens in this punishment cell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">00:24:26</a>, turning Moscow into a "Russian old cm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">00:24:33</a>.

## Political Reforms and Public Opinion Manipulation

There are rumors of impending political reforms, including a project to cancel gubernatorial elections starting in the fall, and plans to remove around 20 governors, some of whom may go to prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">00:26:42</a>. This information, often coming from sources linked to the presidential administration and FSB, is partly genuine discussion and partly "falsified" information used to "model the situation with public opinion for manipulation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">00:27:31</a>.

There is a discussion about transferring gubernatorial elections to regional legislative assemblies, possibly with public involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">00:28:18</a>. The idea of holding elections in the fall is considered "extremely risky" given the mass public mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">00:19:15</a>.

### Propaganda and Public Reaction
The government intends to spend 25 million rubles on billboards near the metro describing business support measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">00:29:50</a>. This is seen as a way to "steal money" and will only cause "the strongest irritation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">00:31:35</a>. Such propaganda is poorly concealed and leads to "class hatred" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">00:32:27</a>. Questions like "with what money are you sitting?" arise when official messages advise staying home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">00:32:05</a>.

## Imminent Crisis and Potential for [[Possibility of revolution and political crisis in Russia | Social Unrest]]

The current situation is viewed as a "fatal shot to the economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">00:35:36</a>, with an extended self-isolation regime being a "control shot in the head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">00:35:43</a>. The speaker predicts a de facto exit from quarantine in May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">00:36:13</a>, where businesses will operate semi-underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">00:36:36</a>, but life will not return to its previous "boiling" state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">00:37:21</a>.

Consequences will be severe: widespread unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">00:37:46</a> and significant problems in the financial and banking sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">00:37:50</a>. Moscow alone could see half a million unemployed without counting migrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">00:38:00</a>.

While society shows sharp increases in "aggressiveness, irritation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">00:39:06</a>, it is not yet ready for "mass demonstrations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:11">00:39:11</a>, though local conflicts and deviant behavior will grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">00:39:13</a>. The full impact of the crisis is expected in the fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:36">00:39:36</a>.

The situation is escalating to a point where the "physical survival of the nation" is at stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">00:41:22</a>. This situation is due to the will of "people who represent us society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:03">00:45:03</a>, and the public will have to rebuild everything on the fly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">00:45:17</a>. The future "will depend solely on our actions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">00:45:25</a>.

The agenda for the future is "extremely simple" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:13">00:44:13</a>: the "resignation of the president and government and the formation of the government national saved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">00:43:36</a>. This must be achieved "on the streets and squares," as it cannot be done through elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">00:44:00</a>.

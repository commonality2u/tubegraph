[[Occultism and magical practices in Russia | Occult]] practices are increasingly prevalent in Russia, intensifying the country's situation [00:01:22]. This trend is significantly linked to Vladimir Putin, who is referred to as the "demiurge," and the constant discussion surrounding his mortality [00:01:36]. These "newfangled hobbies" or attempts to "domesticate this fear" are aimed at overcoming anxiety about his death [00:01:46].

## [[Putins occult interests and practices | Putin's Occult Interests and Practices]]

Concerns about Putin's health and the perceived end of his "luck" are seen as drivers behind the increasing [[influence_of_occult_practices_in_russian_politics | occult component]] in the current government [00:09:07]. It is suggested that the rise in occult interest is due to a "fading age" and a feeling of "exhaustion of his luck" [00:16:56]. Since August 2020, following events like the Belarus revolution, "everything begins to fall apart," and Russia's [[the_influence_of_media_and_public_opinion_in_russian_politics | influence]] in regions like the South Caucasus is diminishing [00:17:31].

Close associates of Putin reportedly complain about the inability to meet or speak with him, causing fright and a sense of "extreme nervousness and very anxious... semi-panic" [00:17:57]. This is significant because these are "people who have gone through difficult times" and held an "almost mystical belief in Putin's luck" [00:18:26]. This year, however, the talk of his luck has stopped, replaced by a sentiment that "luck is lost" [00:19:21].

Specific examples of Putin's alleged occult practices include:
*   **Non-Christian Rites**: In April, Putin reportedly performed "very strange non-Christian rites" with an elder named Nikifor (a pseudonym) [00:10:07]. These rituals were for Putin's health and protection, as well as for inducing "damage and evil oil" on his enemies [00:10:44]. Such practices are considered "not accepted among Christians" [00:10:51].
*   **Consultations with Fortune-Tellers**: Early in his leadership, Putin consulted three fortune-tellers to determine his future [00:11:41]. Two of these were outside Russia, and none knew the identity of the person they were advising [00:12:01]. All three gave "almost identical predictions," stating he would rule for 20 years, but the end of his reign would be "terrible if he cannot change the world" [00:12:16]. These predictions, though extensive, were not veiled like those of Nostradamus, and allegedly contained allegories easily read as "real things" in Russian politics, such as references to Georgia and Ukraine [00:12:45]. The predictions were delivered without a final paragraph, which stated, "all twelve turn away from you" and to "be afraid of part of the southern ruler of poisons" [00:13:30]. This final part mentioned southern rulers like Milosevic, Mubarak, and Gaddafi [00:14:06]. The speaker emphasizes that "it's important how it is perceived by those people who turned to predictions and who became guided by these predictions" [00:14:39].

## [[Mystical beliefs among Russian elite | Mystical Beliefs Among the Elite]]

The trend of [[occult_practices_in_russian_politics | occult]] and mystical beliefs extends throughout the Russian elite, who often "strive to imitate the first overlord," Putin [00:37:51]. This includes attempts to "deceive history" or "challenge fate" [00:15:22].

### Pyramids Near Tomsk
A group of businessmen, possibly connected to Prigozhin, are building a pyramid near Tomsk [00:02:03]. The architect, Valery Uvarov, also designed a spa and salon owned by Prigozhin's spouse [00:02:18]. This object, which can be found in online video reports, is considered "very symptomatic" of the "Egyptian means" that have engulfed the [[influence_of_occult_practices_in_russian_politics | occult hobby of the Russian elite]] [00:02:44]. Pyramids are "being molded in different places all over the country" [00:03:11]. The developers of the Tomsk pyramid are reportedly deputies of United Russia and large businessmen [00:03:24].

Historically, an archaeological expedition in the late 1980s discovered Bronze Age graves in the Tomsk area containing inventory items related to Egyptian culture, likely due to ancient trade routes [00:03:49]. While Egyptian pyramids were mostly tombs, modern interpretations in Russia suggest they are endowed with "mystical power" [00:07:08]. The concept is that a political subject should be at the top, shamans (former USSR party workers) in the middle, and folk doctors like Malakhov at the bottom for prolonging life [00:07:38]. However, one farmer who built a large pyramid in southern Russia eventually went bankrupt, despite initial claims of being cured of diseases and increased yields [00:08:11].

### The Cult of Santa Muerte
The cult of Santa Muerte is a syncretic Mexican cult combining Christianity and traditional Mexican beliefs [00:28:42]. Its altars require a skeleton or skull of a "powerful person," such as a general, because the result of rituals would be "stupid" if it belonged to a fool [00:29:21]. Graves of significant historical figures in Central and South America have reportedly been dug up to supply these altars [00:29:45].

There are three varieties of the cult:
*   **Black Death**: For career growth and benefits [00:30:03].
*   **Golden Death**: For wealth [00:30:16].
*   **White Death**: For worldly goods like love [00:30:21].

This cult is "very fashionable and relevant" in Russia [00:30:48]. Followers often blend it with Catholic faith, attending church for confession and communion while also seeking rituals at Santa Muerte altars [00:31:16].

### Shamans and Psychoactive Substances
The demand for shamans has grown significantly since 2014-2015 [00:39:51]. There are "fashionable shamans" in Moscow, as well as astrologers and tarot card readers, with "colossal queues" for their services [00:40:17]. People in the elite often try various practitioners, leading to a "market of quasi-occult and pseudo-esoteric services" where charlatans and their suppliers thrive [00:41:02].

Supplying "magicians from the Amazon delta with supposedly ayahuasca" is a lucrative business [00:41:35]. Intermediaries prepare shamans before client meetings, explaining "what it would be important for the client to hear," which biases the client's perception [00:42:02]. For instance, a Ukrainian oligarch reportedly brought an Amazonian shaman from the Kayapo tribe to Russia [00:46:53]. While such shamans may appear authentic, their practices often deviate from their roots, with the business being highly profitable [00:47:07].

Some tribes, like the Yanomami (Yamu Yama Mama) from northeastern Brazil and southern Venezuela, practice cannibalism as part of their rituals [00:48:21]. They enter deep trances using psilocybin mushrooms and are not socialized with external civilization [00:48:08]. They believe that consuming the ashes of victims (after eating the flesh) holds "special mystical power" [00:49:15]. Despite such practices, their standard of living has not improved [00:49:48].

### Religious Relics and Human Remains
The "demand for this attribute" (human remains) has always been high, exploited by various religious cults [00:24:00]. This practice contradicts Old Testament prohibitions against touching the dead [00:24:26]. Examples of deception include two alleged heads of John Chrysostom and the mummified corpse of a circumcised person passed off as Saint Alexander of Svir [00:24:50]. People pay "a lot of money" for these "elements of miracle" [00:27:03]. For officials with vast amounts of cash, amounts like 250-300 thousand American dollars for such attributes are considered "insignificant" [00:27:54].

## The "New Middle Ages" and Societal Context
The prevalence of mystical, quasi-esoteric, and pseudo-[[occultism_and_magical_practices_in_russia | occult moods]] in Russia is considered "much worse" than in the late Russian Empire [00:39:04]. Virtually no group within the establishment is unaffected [00:39:07]. Each group has its "own fashion or... passion," turning to everything from Shambhala searches to Orthodox elders, and various shamans [00:39:12]. This universal adoption suggests that not engaging in these practices is an "exception" [00:39:40].

The leadership's style is seen as setting the fashion, allowing others to "stand out by choosing some exotic cult" [00:39:58]. The elite, accustomed to "pull through" difficulties with political and economic instruments, are now turning to "magical instrument[s]" because "reality began to resist" conventional means, except for repression [00:42:42]. There is a belief among officials, including FSB officers and a significant part of the financial elite, in a "world government" or "secret chancery" [00:43:09]. They seek a "pass to this government" or "ring of omnipotence" and compete through various "magical or pseudo occult resources" [00:43:28].

This situation reflects a "new Middle Ages" in Russia, where people poison themselves like in the era of Alexander I, and the government engages in "dense black magic rituals" and "worships the remains of the dead" [01:09:09]. This era is characterized by turbulence and a "great demand for a miracle" [00:58:48]. The Russian establishment "is thirsty for a miracle" for Putin to leave while everything remains unchanged, which is deemed impossible [00:59:02]. There is a collective feeling of "fear" and "chills" within the establishment, akin to being in a "cemetery where twilight thickens" [00:59:55]. Their "group identity" now includes participation in these occult practices [00:46:05].

## [[Influence of occult practices in Russian politics | Relationship with World Occult Orders]]
It is claimed that Russia currently has "no contacts with the 13 great world occult orders" [00:50:51]. A past conflict arose from an "unsuccessful joke" that was perceived as an "insult" by the "great master of the 13 orders," leading to "insurmountable contradictions" [00:51:17].

A significant ritual was initiated by the 13 great world occult orders on June 21, the summer solstice, performed by "authentic shamans" in the Ligand Gorge in Nepal [00:52:17]. It is suggested that events dramatically changed "after" this date, implying a connection to the perceived "disappearance of luck" [00:52:36].

These "non-public organizations" are described as acting like political subjects, influencing Russian and Western governments [00:54:48]. They reportedly have "adherents supporters adherents" within the Russian government and "objects supporters adherents in a number of Western governments" [00:54:56]. They are credited with Russia receiving "a number of sensitive slaps on the nose" due to their actions, influencing Western media campaigns and the "furious" tone of Western leaders like Macron towards Putin [00:55:11].

These organizations do not consider themselves "puppeteers" and believe in people's free will, emphasizing conscious choice over manipulation [00:57:57]. While there is no "world government" in the sense of total control, non-public organizations pursuing specific goals through non-public means are a historical constant [00:58:24].

The fundamental principles of the 13 orders are described as "freedom," "enlightenment," and "completely free and knowledge without censorship" [01:01:52]. These principles are "completely rejected by the Russian establishment of the Russian government," which prefers "spiritual bond[s]" and adherence to established figures [01:02:09]. It is asserted that the "organization always comes for its debts, always, and it takes its debts in full" [01:07:54].

The "militaristic rhetoric" seen previously has "disappeared completely," and the prospect of a "small victorious war" to boost ratings, which was previously discussed, is no longer considered feasible [00:53:15]. This shift is seen as a sign of lost luck.

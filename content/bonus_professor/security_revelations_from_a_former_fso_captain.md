Valery Solovey's program addressed questions concerning the revelations made by former Federal Protective Service (FSO) Captain Gleb Karakulov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Karakulov, a captain, served in the Technical Division of the FSO, specifically within its Special Communications Service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The FSO is described as a vast organization, potentially employing up to 50,000 people, with over 30,000 confirmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

Karakulov's role primarily involved providing communications as a technical specialist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. It is important to note that the FSO's "holy of holies," the Presidential Security Service, operates separately from the unit Karakulov served in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Signalmen who serve the president are typically isolated in separate buildings, bunkers, or rooms and rarely see the president, usually only from a distance of several tens of meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Due to this separation, Captain Karakulov could not have been part of the immediate "Security Circle" close to the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Nature of Karakulov's Information

The information shared by Karakulov in his interview largely originates from conversations overheard "in smoking rooms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. These areas, along with telephones, are known to be wiretapped, and [[internal_purges_in_the_fsb_and_implications_for_russian_opposition | FSO employees]] in significant roles are under surveillance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Thus, the information he presented is primarily rumors and legends circulated by auxiliary FSO personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

Furthermore, most of what Karakulov revealed was already known from other sources, including the speaker himself, for at least the past two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. His opinions regarding the president's physical health are deemed unreliable, as he would have had no direct knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. While not accused of deliberate lying, Karakulov is believed to be leveraging his position to "raise his price" by presenting his information as exclusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

It was noted that several more high-ranking, influential, and knowledgeable individuals from the FSO have left the country in the last two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Unlike Karakulov, these individuals have chosen not to publicly share their information, likely because it is genuinely sensitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Karakulov's revelations are therefore significant mainly for confirming existing information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

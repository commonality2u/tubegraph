The decision to implement [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization]] in Russia is inextricably linked with the introduction of martial law, whether martial law precedes or follows [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Key Legal Framework

Several federal laws are of primary importance for understanding [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[01:00:00]</a>:
*   Federal Law 31: The law on mobilization preparation and [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   Federal Constitutional Law: The law on Martial Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   The law on military duty and military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

Decisions on [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization]] can only be made by the president, who relies on these federal laws and potentially new legal acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Definition and Scope of Mobilization

[[mobilization_process_in_russia | Mobilization]] is understood as the transfer of the country's state structures, economy, and everyday life to a war footing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This includes the entire country, affecting the Russian economy and financial/banking system, and potentially involving the confiscation of private assets like cars for transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

### Types of Mobilization

A decision on [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization]] may concern:
*   **Partial [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization]]**: Affecting a number of territories within the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Full [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]]**: Applying nationwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. It is assumed that even if [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization]] begins as partial, it will likely develop into full nationwide [[mobilization_in_russia_and_potential_nationwide_mobilization | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Grounds for Introducing Martial Law and Mobilization

The reasons for introducing martial law, which is followed by or associated with [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization]], are listed in the law on martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The most pertinent reasons cited are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>:
*   Bombing of Russian Federation territory by foreign armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   An attack by foreign armed forces on the armed forces of the Russian Federation, regardless of location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   The deployment of armed gangs, groups, regular forces, or mercenaries by a foreign state to carry out aggression against Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

It is stated that these points have been observed to some degree, meaning formal legal grounds for the introduction of martial law and subsequent [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization]] already exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation has also repeatedly mentioned the possibility of a provocation from the Ukrainian side involving chemical means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

## Who is Subject to Mobilization?

Citizens who are in the reserve and do not have a formal deferment are subject to conscription for military service for [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

This primarily includes:
*   All men with a military ID aged 18 to 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   Those with a fitness category for the army: "fully Fit" (A) and "Fit with minor restrictions" (B) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   Individuals categorized as "limited Fit" (V) who do not serve in peacetime due to health but receive a military ID after 27 years old; they can be mobilized from 27 to 50 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   Women with the necessary education and military registration specialty, primarily medical, but not exclusively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

Those in the reserve are distributed among three categories, with conscription likely starting with the first category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>:
*   **First Category**: Men under 35 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Second Category**: Men up to 45 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

*   Students of scientific educational institutions who study in the full-time form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. However, new legal acts may change these provisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

*   Those who received a category "D" at the draft board, meaning generally not fit for military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   Some exceptions for female military personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

## Technical Aspects of Mobilization

Upon announcement of [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization]], all citizens subject to conscription are obliged to appear at assembly points within the timeframes specified in the [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization]] orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   **Delivery of Orders**: Orders can be delivered at home or to the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. It is assumed that military registration and enlistment office employees, possibly accompanied by police or Russian Guard patrols, will deliver these orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Travel Restrictions**: Those registered for military service are prohibited from leaving their place of residence once [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization]] is announced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. If orders or a summons are received, they are obliged to appear at military commissariats or other relevant authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

### Valid Reasons for Not Appearing on Summons

According to the federal law on military duty and military service, valid reasons for not appearing on a summons include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>:
*   Illnesses or conditions leading to temporary loss of ability to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   Serious health conditions of specified relatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   Death of relatives, requiring participation in the funeral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

## Penalties for Evasion

In peacetime, failing to appear on a summons from the military registration and enlistment office incurs administrative liability, which may be a warning or a fine of 500 to 3000 rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Evasion of military service in peacetime is covered by Article 328 of the Criminal Code, which provides for a fine of up to 200,000 rubles or imprisonment for up to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Penalties in wartime are not explicitly detailed but will likely be more severe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

## Social and Financial Implications

To stimulate compliance, measures such as blocking bank accounts and cards of those subject to [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization]], and closing travel abroad, are being considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
*   **Financial Preparedness**: Individuals are advised to transfer money to relatives' accounts or withdraw cash in advance to bypass potential account blocking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Travel Documents**: It is advised to keep foreign passports in a safe, easily accessible place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **Regional Impact**: [[mobilization_process_in_russia | Mobilization]] is expected to primarily affect residents of small and medium-sized cities, with large cities being impacted last <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

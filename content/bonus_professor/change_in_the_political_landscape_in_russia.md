The political landscape in Russia is undergoing significant shifts, with a focus on potential leadership transitions and internal elite conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Impending Political Shifts
A decision regarding the transfer of power or a gradual replacement of President Putin with another person may begin in late autumn or early winter, potentially even earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. This timeline is influenced by the internal political dynamics, including concerns about President Putin's health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. The Kremlin's internal political agenda is becoming paramount, with the ongoing military operation potentially becoming an impediment to these primary political tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

The higher elite of the Russian Federation are aware that President Putin will likely have to leave his position soon or significantly weaken his public presence in Russian politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.

## Elite Divisions
Conversations about a split within the Russian elites, previously hypothetical, are now beginning to materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. An "anti-Chekist" or "anti-Patrushev" coalition has started to form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

### Members of the Anti-Patrushev Coalition
This emerging coalition includes prominent figures such as:
*   Roman Abramovich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>
*   Anatoly Chubais <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>
*   Vladimir Potanin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>
*   Oleg Deripaska <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>

Oleg Deripaska notably demonstrated dissent during Putin's speech at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum by not applauding the president's entrance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. The "Yeltsin family" is also associated with Oleg Deripaska <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

### The Conflict's Origin
The coalition is termed "anti-Patrushev" because Nikolai Patrushev, Secretary of the Security Council, is attempting to position his son, Dmitry Patrushev (Minister of Agriculture), as President Putin's successor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. This "sounding" for Dmitry Patrushev is facing extreme resistance, not only from oligarchs and civilians but also from within the ranks of power groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

A powerful elite coalition has emerged to prevent power from remaining solely in the hands of a security group, as Dmitry Patrushev's succession would imply continued governance by the security forces, particularly his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

### Alternative Successors
The anti-Patrushev group reportedly views Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov as a potential president and Elvira Nabiullina, head of the Central Bank, as a prospective head of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

This indicates a clear and obvious confrontation between civilian factions and security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. The "struggle for Putin's Russia" has already begun and is expected to intensify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

## Implications and Outlook
The formation of this coalition is currently situational, and its future expansion or potential splits are unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. However, it is united by a shared class closeness and possibly a common view of Russia's future without Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.

The "season of struggle" is opening, including a "hunting season" for those who may pose a threat or whose departure could signal a shift in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Recent "strange deaths" of oil workers and the former head of Uralenergosbyt, Alexey Agar, are cited as examples, with suggestions that Agar's death may not have been natural <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

These changes are expected to be difficult, unpleasant, and painful for Russia in the coming months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

[[future_political_changes_and_developments_in_russia | Future political changes and developments in Russia]] will likely be characterized by this internal elite conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.

Valery Solovey defines patriotism as a simple concept: love for one's country and its people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. He distinguishes this from the deification of the state, which he believes is often promoted in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

## Defining Patriotism

True patriotism, according to Solovey, is focused on one's native land and nation, regardless of how that nation is named <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. It is driven by the desire to improve life for the people, making it freer, wealthier, more peaceful, and protected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## Personal Stance

Valery Solovey identifies himself as a "100% Patriot" in this sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. He expresses love for his country and people, and a commitment to doing everything possible to ensure they live better, freer, and more prosperous lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. He states confidence in achieving these goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## A Decent Future for the Russian People

Solovey emphasizes that the people of Russia have earned the right to a decent life through their labor and dedication, despite often living in "beggarly conditions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. He asserts that his team aims to provide them with a dignified life and enable them to realize this fundamental human right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>. Contributions towards their projects are framed as investments in the "best future of Russia" and for future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>. The speaker concludes with a strong statement of belief in victory for the [[russian_national_pride_and_identity | Russian people]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>.

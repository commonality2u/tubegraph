## Current State of Occultism in Russia

In contemporary Russia, there is a significant [[occult_practices_in_russian_politics | fascination with occult practices]] within the highest echelons of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. This interest is not merely a passing trend but is deeply embedded, influencing decision-making processes in a serious way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. The belief among the elite is that they have entered an [[sociopolitical_implications_of_occult_beliefs | occult war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>, with some believing they are in conflict with "two or three very powerful" occult orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>.

The perception of this reality is so strong that the supreme leadership takes these magical practices seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. The prevailing atmosphere among the elite is described as one of extreme mental instability and a loss of bearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>, leading them to seek "the ring of omnipotence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. This search often involves intermediaries and operators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.

### Case Study: Shaman Alexander Gabyshev

The forced psychiatric hospitalization of Shaman Alexander Gabyshev is presented as a prime example of the [[influence_of_occultism_on_political_figures | interplay of occultism and politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. His isolation is attributed not just to political repression but to the perceived threat of his "magical properties" that needed to be brought under control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

*   **Presidential Order:** There was a direct order from the President of the Russian Federation to "stab the shaman with drugs," aiming to put him in a vegetative state or force him to cease "socially significant initiatives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Triggering Event:** This action was taken just days after Gabyshev announced he had performed a ritual to "drive out evil spirits from the Kremlin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Shamanic Rituals:** Gabyshev belongs to a cultural type of shaman whose worldview is based on mythology and folklore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. His proposed "stolen soul" ritual involves a shaman fighting a demon to return a soul, but crucially, the person whose soul is stolen must participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. As Putin would not participate, the ritual could not be performed remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
*   **Critique of Diagnosis:** The psychiatric diagnosis is questioned, highlighting that Gabyshev's actions do not demonstrate danger to society or himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. The use of psychiatry for punitive purposes is condemned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

## Historical Context of Occultism in Russia

[[historical_context_of_occultism_in_russia | Interest in occultism in Russia]] has a long history, gaining significant traction in the 2000s, fueled by individuals with predictive abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

*   **Early 2000s:** Initial success was linked to one specific person with predictive abilities; after this person's passing, things began to go differently, but the "imprinting" remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **The "Ring of Omnipotence":** Russian rulers, particularly Chekists since the 1920s, have sought "the ring of omnipotence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Orthodoxy to Esotericism:** Initially, there was a turn to Orthodoxy, partly as a tribute to fashion and an attempt to find identity and an instrument of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. However, it was soon realized that Orthodoxy, despite its elders, could not provide what these people needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. By the early 2010s, they increasingly turned to other practices, including Eastern esotericism like Tao and Zen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Shift to Influence:** Around 2014, the focus shifted from merely looking into the future to actively influencing and changing it in the desired direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. This led to the use of various methods, including the concept of a "nooscope" as a quasi-rational attempt to explain magical abilities, akin to a crystal ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **Soviet Era:** Soviet security officers also searched for the "ring of omnipotence" and engaged in parapsychological experiments, including attempts to create a time machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>. The US even borrowed experience from the KGB in this field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>.
*   **Rasputin Analogy:** The historical analogy of Rasputin's influence at the court of Nicholas II is drawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. Rasputin played a political role, appointing ministers, which highlights the authorities' feeling of helplessness during times of crisis and their need for magical aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

## Modern Occult Practices and Rituals

The modern [[role_of_mysticism_and_esotericism_in_the_kremlin | role of mysticism and esotericism in the Kremlin]] is described as far exceeding historical precedents, including the early 20th century Russian Imperial court or even Nazi esotericism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.

*   **"Flights to Sirius and Nibiru":** High-ranking individuals are influenced by "conductors" who propose "flights to Sirius and Nibiru," involving the use of natural alkaloids (like atropine, psilocybin mushrooms) that grow on Russian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>. These rituals involve geometric formations (circles for Nibiru, triangles for Sirius) and lead to vivid, colorful hallucinations, creating a "thought form" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>. Prolonged use of these alkaloids can lead to increased serotonin levels, causing thought process failures and potentially schizophrenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>. This addiction causes rapid personal degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>.
*   **Influence on Decisions:** Individuals experiencing these altered realities make political, financial, and managerial decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>.
*   **Public Popularization:** Programs on channels like Ren TV, financed by Kovalchuk, openly popularize concepts like Nibiru and reptilians, creating a public facade that suggests these beliefs are not "crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>.
*   **Grimoires and Sacrifices:** There is an active acquisition of antique grimoires from Europe, specifically originals, due to a belief in their special power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>. These "operational magic" rituals require experienced operators and involve significant financial transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>. While not human sacrifices, rituals can involve "black rooster or a black goat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>. The purpose is to influence the future and gain invulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>.
*   **Voodoo and Santa Muerte:** Two highly relevant and bloody practices in Moscow are mentioned:
    *   **Voodoo (Water cult):** The "toughest, bloodiest" direction involves digging up fresh corpses (preferably maniac killers or suicides), dismembering them, mixing parts with grave soil, and placing live birds to die in agony to "cleanse" the soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>. Wooden dolls, resembling victims, are soaked in a composition of blood (human origin) and plant juice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:56">[00:48:56]</a>. After burial in grave soil with corpse parts, dolls are fed with "virgin blood and men's sperm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>, then iron objects are driven into them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>. One doll is kept by the adepts, the other sent to the intended victim, relying on the psychological impact of belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:32">[00:50:32]</a>.
    *   **Santa Muerte:** This cult uses mummified remains (not fresh corpses, preferably thoroughly rotted) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>. The mummy is washed, rubbed with incense, adorned with gold crowns and jewelry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:16">[00:52:16]</a>. Followers consider it necessary to have an ancient human skull, ideally belonging to an influential, high-ranking person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>. This cult, originating in Mexico, is also described as bloody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>.

### Occult Rites and Political Synchronization in Russia

The increase in [[occult_rites_and_political_synchronization_in_russia | occult rites and political synchronization in Russia]] is attributed to a combination of modern world instability, Russia's specific instability, and uncertainty among the elite about their positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. The atmosphere is one where rationality is absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>. Even those who fear occultism cannot help but adapt to this "intra-corporate wall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>. What appears monstrous from the outside is internally logical and consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>.

## Religion vs. Occultism: The Church's Stance

The traditional church, particularly the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC), faces challenges in this landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>.

*   **Church's Strategies:** The Church employs three strategies regarding non-traditional occult practices: avoidance/condemnation, calm treatment, and participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>.
*   **Elite's Disengagement:** Some within the Church participate in these practices, believing it to be a real path to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>. However, the Russian elite is actively seeking a powerful force outside of Orthodoxy and Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>. In the last 5-6 years, they have increasingly moved away from traditional religious roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a>.
*   **Skepticism and KGB Influence:** There is widespread skepticism, even within the educated parts of society, towards religious rites, partly due to the historical involvement of the KGB in directly supervising the Russian Orthodox Church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:31">[00:58:31]</a>. The Church's ability to "return to itself" and counter these trends is questioned, as even the highest echelons making decisions about its fate are deeply influenced by these practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:15">[00:57:15]</a>.

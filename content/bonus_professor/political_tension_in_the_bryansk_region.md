On March 6, 2023, the 53rd episode of the "What's Happening" program discussed the incident in the Bryansk region as one of its main topics, among others such as "borders without locks," "a new mythical threat," and the economic crisis in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## The Bryansk Region Incident

The event in the Bryansk region was unequivocally asserted to be a raid by a group referred to as the "Russian volunteer corps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This group was called "so-called" because its existence was not widely known prior to this incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The raid's purpose was described as "to show the flag" and "to demonstrate its own existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

Initial information following the raid was "mutually exclusive" and "contradictory," leading to various theories, including the idea that it was a "cunningly conceived needle" (a false flag operation) by the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. However, this theory was dismissed as a "duck" (false information) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. The contradictory information was so significant that a Security Council meeting scheduled for Thursday, the day the incident occurred, had to be postponed to Friday, as even the President of the Russian Federation and high-ranking security officials lacked clear details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

The incident was described as a "symbolic political" rather than a military event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Its political meaning was an attempt to demonstrate that the [[russianukrainian_relations_and_military_tensions | armed struggle]] between Russia and Ukraine would be "transferred to the field of Russia," carried out by Russian volunteers fighting for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### Public and Official Reactions

It is unlikely that the event would garner support from wide circles of the Russian public, especially since it involved "killing people and shelling civilians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The Security Council, judging by the "lack of decisions," was not frightened by the incident itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Instead, what reportedly concerned them, and the Russian President, was the "presence of the very fact of Russian nationalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

A prominent Russian nationalist expert, Dmitry Demushkin, suggested that the incident might serve as a pretext for a purge of Russian nationalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. While no formal nationalist organizations exist in Russia, only "subcultures" and "informal groups," the purge is anticipated not because nationalists would defect to Ukraine, but in preparation for a "serious [[political_situation_in_russia | political crisis]]" expected after the end of the [[russianukrainian_relations_and_military_tensions | armed confrontation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Security officers, expecting this crisis, are reportedly moving to "protect" or neutralize potential participants, particularly Russian nationalists, who have historically been feared, despite not posing a significant paramilitary threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

The incident also highlighted the vulnerability of the population in border regions, which were shown to be "practically defenseless" against sabotage groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. This lack of protection for citizens does not appear to concern the leadership of the Russian Federation. Instead, the responsibility for defending these territories has been delegated to regional governors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

## Focus on Leadership Security

The Russian leadership, particularly President Putin, is primarily concerned with "its own security" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. This focus on personal security shapes decisions more than events like the Bryansk raid. A more significant concern for Putin was the "mass attack by drones" on February 28, which included a drone falling near Moscow and the temporary closure of Pulkovo Airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Although Ukraine denied authorship, it was widely understood who was behind the attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

The drone attack, though not "successful" in a military sense, demonstrated that the territory of the Russian Federation, including "protected objects," is "achievable" or "touchable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This revelation plays a crucial role in the nature of decisions made by the leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

## Internal Dissatisfaction and Policy Implications

Expectations within the elite, including the FSB, for a series of personnel changes following a Collegium on February 28 were not met, as President Putin decided against major reshuffles, such as replacing the head of the FSB, Bortnikov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. The President did not hold the FSB responsible for the Bryansk incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

However, moods within the FSB (known as "the office") are reportedly characterized by "strong irritation" towards the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, Vladimir Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. They view him as "impotent" in political terms, believing he has made "tragic mistakes" that have led Russia into a "dead end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. There is an unspoken, and sometimes direct, belief that a solution to this crisis must come at the expense of this person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

This internal tension, alongside the perceived vulnerability of Russian territory, contributes to the complex [[russian_internal_political_dynamics | political dynamics]] within Russia following the Bryansk incident.

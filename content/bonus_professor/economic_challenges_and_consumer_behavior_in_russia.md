Russia is reportedly preparing for an [[economic_challenges_and_political_crisis_developments_in_russia | economic crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. An upcoming [[economic_challenges_and_political_crisis_developments_in_russia | economic crisis]] is seen as "almost inevitable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a> and is expected to occur with "very high probability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

## Economic Indicators

According to Bloomberg, Russian imports have returned to 2020 levels, indicating a return to pre-war and pre-pandemic indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. Russia has also restored its exports to pre-war levels, as calculated by Bloomberg, an authoritative economic agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.

However, the financial strain of ongoing military operations is significant, with Russia reportedly spending between $300 million and $400 million per day on its special military operation, according to Bloomberg and other Western agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. This "gigantic money" is spent daily to "kill people and to destroy cities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.

## Consumer Behavior and [[socioeconomic_conditions_in_russia | Socioeconomic Conditions]]

Despite some positive trade indicators, [[economic_conditions_in_russia | consumer behavior]] among Russians points to underlying [[socioeconomic_challenges_in_russia | economic challenges]]:
*   **Declining Retail Sales** Retail sales in Russia have consistently declined for ten consecutive months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. By the end of the previous year, retail sales had fallen by 10.5% in real terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
*   **Population Impoverishment** This decline suggests that the population is becoming poorer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.
*   **Saving Behavior** Many individuals are choosing to save their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.
*   **Reliance on Microloans** A significant portion of the population lives "from pension to pension, from paycheck to paycheck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>, increasingly relying on microloans to make ends meet until their next payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.
*   **Expectation of Worsening Conditions** People are preparing for a future where [[socioeconomic_challenges_in_russia | economic conditions]] will be even worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. This collective anticipation is seen as a psychological factor contributing to the inevitability of an [[economic_challenges_and_political_crisis_developments_in_russia | economic crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

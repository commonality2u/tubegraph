Valery Solovey states that the authorities are attempting to kill [[Alexei Navalnys imprisonment and its implications | Alexei Navalny]], an effort which he notes is "not unsuccessful and is happening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

Solovey expresses strong support for an initiative by doctors who have made a collective appeal on behalf of the medical community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This appeal calls for [[Navalnys imprisonment and political prisoners in Russia | Alexei Navalny]] to be provided with qualified medical care and to be transferred from prison to a civilian medical institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

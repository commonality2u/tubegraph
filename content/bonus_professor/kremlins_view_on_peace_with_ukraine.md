The Kremlin envisions [[prospects_of_peace_between_ukraine_and_russia | peace with Ukraine]] as a key outcome dependent on global events, notably the United States presidential elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The Russian leadership's actions in both domestic and international policy are shaped by the results of these elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Initial Diplomatic Overtures

Following the U.S. elections on November 6, two Russian elite coalitions, one led by Chemezov and the other by Patrushev, extended congratulations to Donald Trump through informal channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. These communications expressed an enthusiastic desire to "untie the knot of contradictions around Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Trump responded on the same day, referring to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine as an "incident" that needed to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This characterization is seen as indicative of Trump's foreign policy perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Proposed Path to Peace

One of the [[kremlins_diplomatic_strategies_with_ukraine_and_the_west | Kremlin sides]] proposed a "truce" as a necessary preliminary stage for the commencement of [[peace_negotiations_with_ukraine | peace negotiations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

On November 7, a conversation reportedly took place between Donald Trump and the "so-called president of Russia" (identified as a double) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. During this discussion, the Kremlin outlined its vision for the contours of peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Kremlin's Peace Proposal

The **[[potential_peace_proposals_between_russia_and_ukraine | Kremlin's peace proposal]]** includes the following conditions:
*   **Crimea** must remain with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Donetsk and Luhansk regions** (in their administrative borders) must remain with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Territorial Exchange**: Ukraine would yield the Kursk region, and Russia would give up fragments of territories it controls in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Land Corridor to Crimea**: The Kremlin is willing to abandon the idea of maintaining a land corridor to Crimea, provided that Ukraine guarantees unimpeded transit of goods and people from mainland Russia to the Crimean peninsula through Ukrainian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This marks a step back from previous consultations, where Russia insisted on retaining the land corridor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

Trump's response to these proposals was a pause, stating he could not say anything "off the cuff" and would need to consider and discuss them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. The leak of this conversation suggests that some within Trump's circle are not pleased with or evaluate these proposals as unrealistic or undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

## Internal Dynamics and US Influence

Trump's "economic-centric policy" includes a strong motivation to establish [[peace_negotiations_and_kremlins_perspective | peace]] and act as a peacemaker, aiming for an "epochal achievement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. He holds the potential to influence or pressure both sides of the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

However, the American president's powers are not absolute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Trump will have to contend with his own party officials who may have different views on the Russia-Ukraine confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Key positions like Secretary of State and Assistant to the President for National Security are significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

Furthermore, the "Deep State" — the Washington bureaucracy — which has historically blocked initiatives deemed detrimental to U.S. international leadership, still exists and can influence decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

> [!INFO] **Deep State Influence**
> During Trump's first presidency (2016-2020), the "Deep State" was able to block a number of initiatives and decisions by the President of the United States that it considered detrimental or dangerous for the U.S. role in the international arena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. This influence remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

## [[Kremlins foreign policy and decisionmaking | Kremlin's Internal State]]

The speaker suggests that the "so-called Putin" is a double whose career as president is ending, with "Politburo 2" having decided to end this "tragicomic" situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. This double is described as "not very educated" and "not very smart," experiencing difficulty pronouncing words during speeches, which is attributed to intellectual challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. Despite promises of a secure life post-presidency, the double is reportedly worried about his own fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] **Economic Hardships**
> The speaker warns that the Russian government intends to emerge from the current crisis at the expense of society and the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.

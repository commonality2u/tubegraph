The current situation in Russia is anticipated to develop with increasing alarm, speed, and severity, potentially leading to the imposition of martial law across the entire country [00:01:35]. This environment will render existing laws meaningless, allowing authorities to control people's lives, property, and savings at will [00:02:24]. The introduction of "military serfdom" has begun, marking a monstrous social regression and the enslavement of the Russian population [00:02:50].

The coming year is expected to be lived in a state of "severe, constant, permanent stress," with lives, property, and modest savings facing a "constant and also a growing threat" [00:06:00]. It is crucial to learn to live within this [[strategies_to_cope_with_stress_and_crisis | permanent crisis]] [00:06:21].

## The Importance of Support Networks
A foundational aspect of surviving the impending crisis is the understanding that it will be "impossible or extremely difficult to survive alone" [00:07:10]. The anticipated stress will not only be strong but also "almost constant" and intensifying, lasting for months [00:07:16]. In such circumstances, individuals need support, people with whom they can share fears and concerns, and "those to whom we can cry" [00:07:28]. Crying in the presence of close individuals helps reduce personal stress levels [00:07:38].

### The Role of Women in Maintaining Emotional Balance
Women play a "primary role" in building emotional balance and mental stability within families and among relatives and friends [00:07:51]. Men are noted to "more easily and quickly fall into prostration or a panic state" [00:08:02]. A significant amount will depend on women's resilience and capacity to provide support [00:08:18].

### Strategic Approach to Crisis
Instead of instinctive reactions like fighting or running, it is advised to "first of all to think about what and how can be done" [00:08:33]. Actions should be rational and consistent, aimed at benefiting individuals and their loved ones without causing harm [00:08:38].

Beyond family and friendly support, the strategy emphasizes the need to "share stress" so that the burden becomes easier to bear collectively [00:08:54].

## Priorities for Survival
In this escalating crisis, two main priorities are identified:
1.  **Preserving life and health** for oneself, family, and friends [00:10:02]. This directly relates to [[preserving_life_health_and_property_during_unstable_times | preserving life, health, and property during unstable times]].
2.  **Preserving property** (often modest) and savings, and business if applicable [00:10:10].

These two lines represent an "absolute priority," with everything else, such as apartment repairs, purchases, or vacation plans, becoming secondary [00:11:17]. It is important not to try to solve everything at once and to accept that some secondary tasks and needs will have to be forgotten or ignored due to limited time and energy [00:11:42].

## Recommendations for Action
It's stressed that "none of us will be able to do it individually and no family" will be able to get out of the situation without losses [00:10:31]. Therefore, "losses are inevitable" [00:10:52].

### Avoiding Risks and Safeguarding Assets
Individuals should "avoid those places and situations where and when the risks for you increase" [00:12:35]. This includes risks related to mobilization and interactions with law enforcement [00:12:41].

It is important to note that despite assurances, the single register of military personnel and summons will not be ready until autumn [00:13:59], but other integrated databases are sufficient to issue summonses and "comb the public" [00:14:15]. The law adopted on April 11 is misleading regarding a 20-day grace period; "you will not have any 20 days in sight" [00:14:28].

Automatic blocking of bank accounts and cards is anticipated, even though it's not explicitly mentioned in the law, as it's considered the "most effective" measure in internal documents [00:14:44]. Driver's licenses and civil rights, including the ability to travel abroad, may also be restricted [00:15:02]. These measures will happen "here and immediately" [00:15:18].

Future mobilization efforts may also see a transition to "self-sufficiency" for mobilized personnel, meaning families will be expected to supply equipment and bulletproof vests [00:15:52].

### Financial and Property Preparedness
Regarding [[recommendations_for_financial_and_personal_preparedness_amidst_crisis | saving property and modest funds]], practical steps include:
*   **Withdrawing cash:** Money can be withdrawn or transferred to trusted relatives or friends [00:16:26]. Always have a sufficient amount of cash for "necessary operational freedom" [00:16:33].
*   **Car ownership:** A general power of attorney for a car is ineffective as it remains personal property and can be seized [00:17:05].
*   **Business:** Rewriting business ownership may be difficult or impossible [00:17:27]. The principle is to "lose a little money than a precious life" [00:17:43]. Legal counsel is recommended for business preservation strategies [00:17:56]. Always have a lawyer's phone number [00:18:12].

## Core Principles for Resilience
The current period is described as a "holiday of common misfortune" or a "funeral feast," where everyone is a visitor [00:18:50]. The goal is to leave this "mournful funeral feast with the least losses, perhaps having lost some money and some skin but alive and well" [00:19:11].

Key advice for navigating this period includes:
1.  **Calmness:** The most important thing is "calmness" or at least the "absence of hysteria and panic" [00:19:28].
2.  **Safe Haven:** A "safe haven, reliable friends or an extensive family that can come to the rescue, and a spare person" are the desired minimum [00:19:42].
3.  **Reducing Stress:** While getting rid of stress entirely may not be possible, the goal is to reduce its level and learn to live with it [00:20:21].

Despite the great troubles and high price of the changes, there is a firm belief that "ultimately victory would be ours" [00:22:03].

From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

A question was posed regarding whether [[potential political and military actions involving Russia | Russia's policy]], under a new government, would aim for full integration into NATO and the European Union (EU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

## Current Stance on Integration

The speaker believes that currently, no one in NATO or the European Union is in a position to consider integration with [[potential political and military developments in Russia and Ukraine | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. This is likened to the challenge of "persuading the British Queen" (or King) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

## Future Goals and Relations

Instead of full integration, the primary objective for new political forces in [[potential political and military developments in Russia and Ukraine | Russia]] after the cessation of hostilities is to establish normal working relations with [[european_politics_and_relations_with_russia | European institutions]] and NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

### Timeline for Normalization
Consultations on establishing these relations are already underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. It is believed that this normalization, including the lifting of most sanctions, could occur within the foreseeable future, specifically within 2-3 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. This timeline is not projected for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

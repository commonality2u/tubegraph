This article summarizes discussions on the upcoming Russian presidential elections, the political climate, potential risks, and strategies for navigating the current situation.

## Election Risks and the "Transit Scheme"
A "transit scheme" involving a preliminary agreement was reached around late November, concerning changes in leadership [00:01:47]. The concept of a "double" standing in for the president in the upcoming presidential elections presents significant risks [00:02:07]. Those involved in the compromise are observing how Nikolai Patrushev, currently considered the supreme ruler of Russia, conducts affairs, and how his son, Dmitry Patrushev, would manage if he becomes Prime Minister [00:02:48]. There is no rush to change supreme power, as key figures know "much more" about Nikolai Patrushev [00:03:05].

It is expected that the current political agreement or "game" will be replayed [00:03:32]. If a "double" is elected president, they would be under complete control of Nikolai Patrushev, unable to act independently [00:05:00]. The elite groups recognize that playing this "risky game" [00:05:28] is necessary.

## Evidence of a Double and Public Readiness
There is information suggesting that the President of Russia is deceased and has been replaced by a "double" [00:07:46]. Evidence cited includes a sudden, diametrically opposite change in the president's behavior, appearance, voice, and even an apparent increase in height [00:07:55]. This information, reportedly, has been published in major Western and non-Western publications [00:08:34].

Despite this, there is no impression that society is ready to act, with many demanding "100% evidence" [00:09:03]. This demand for irrefutable proof is seen as a justification for inaction [00:09:10]. The speaker suggests that the public has not been shown the bodies of deceased leaders in the past (e.g., Brezhnev, Chernenko, Andropov, Yeltsin) [00:06:05].

## Political Climate and Future Outlook
The current situation is predicted to worsen, becoming more difficult than the COVID-19 pandemic or the "special military operation" [00:06:53]. The death of Putin is seen not as liberation, but as a chance that must be seized [00:07:13]. Clear signs of a [[political_crisis_prediction_and_influence | political crisis]] are expected within three months, possibly before the presidential elections in March [00:15:37].

Positive changes in the international situation, particularly for Russian-Ukrainian relations, are not expected before autumn [00:15:48]. Western and Eastern countries, including Arab nations, Saudi Arabia, and China, are primarily focused on their own interests rather than promoting freedom and democracy in Russia [00:16:23]. The West's fundamental interest is maintaining [[public_response_and_strategies_for_maintaining_political_stability | stability]] in Russia, regardless of the regime's nature [00:17:11]. This situation is acceptable for these international actors, though "unacceptable" for the Russian people [00:18:27].

Regarding the possibility of a second wave of [[potential_future_mobilization_and_military_strategies | mobilization]], no one can predict it definitively, as it depends on the dynamics of the general and domestic political situations and the Russian-Ukrainian confrontation [00:34:25]. Russian troops are currently engaged in counterattacks that serve a political goal of demonstrating offensive potential and creating a favorable background before the presidential elections [00:34:42]. This also aims to show the West that aid to Ukraine is pointless and to encourage pressure for peace talks [00:35:05].

## Proposed Slogan and Post-Transition Russia
A suggested slogan for the opposition is "Putin is dead, all this is illegitimate" [00:27:01].

In a new Russia, it is believed that anyone can rule better than a "dead person," given "common sense" and "love for your people" [00:27:32]. The speaker believes that a return to a dictatorial form of power similar to the current one is "practically impossible" [00:33:52]. Mechanisms of checks and balances, both institutional and extra-institutional, will be implemented to prevent a reversal of the democratic path [00:33:57].

The speaker also believes that cases on foreign currency mortgages could be reviewed in a new Russia [00:30:39].

## Leadership and Political Figures
Nikolai Patrushev is currently considered the supreme ruler of Russia, a result of a broad compromise and agreement among elite groups [00:02:19]. Mikhail Mishustin, as interim head of state after the president's death, lacks significant power to initiate political systemic decisions [00:04:05].

Oleg Derep is mentioned as a candidate in the presidential elections, though this is treated as a rumor [00:37:23].

After the end of the confrontation, those who fought in Ukraine are unlikely to be honored in Russia; the speaker expects a similar outcome to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, where soldiers were essentially disavowed [00:36:20]. Leadership of the Ministry of Defense, including Shoigu and Gerasimov, are expected to be held responsible for violating the law and betraying the country [00:36:49].

## Opposition and Political Prisoners
Alexei Navalny is currently in transit to a maximum-security penal colony, and while not completely healthy, is in an "acceptable physical condition" [00:09:22]. The speaker believes that changes in Russia will free not only Navalny and Yashin but all political prisoners, including Igor Strelkov Girkin [00:32:33].

## Media and Information Hygiene
Regarding information hygiene, finding high-quality analytics is "very, very difficult" [00:19:31]. The "General SVR" channel is considered an informational and introductory channel rather than an analytical one [00:20:01]. The speaker states that no single analytical channel adequately covers the overall situation [00:20:12]. For facts and information, rather than opinions, users should seek Telegram channels that provide simple information in "Information mode" [00:21:46].

[[Hybrid warfare and NATOs response | Hybrid operations]] are a key element of modern geopolitical confrontation, involving a range of tools beyond traditional military engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. The Russian leadership is reportedly considering and testing the capabilities of such operations, particularly in relation to the Baltic countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

## Characteristics of Hybrid Operations
A [[hybrid_warfare_and_natos_response | hybrid operation]] is distinct from a full-fledged [[Military Strategy and Developments | military operation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Its military component is typically introduced only at the final stage and even then, should not be significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. The initial stages of a [[hybrid_warfare_and_natos_response | hybrid operation]] are designed to create chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

## Role of Cyber Attacks
Cyber attacks are identified as one of the most effective tools used in combination within a [[hybrid_warfare_and_natos_response | hybrid operation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. These attacks can target:
*   Websites of banking institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>
*   Logistics systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>
*   Websites of state and municipal institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>
*   Navigation systems, as seen with Russian testing in the Baltic Sea area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>

## Russian Strategy
Russia has been testing its capabilities to disrupt websites and navigation systems, particularly in the Baltic Sea region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. The aim is to create a new field of tension in Europe, potentially in Latvia and Estonia, due to their significant Russian-speaking populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. This strategy aims to distract the West and [[hybrid_warfare_and_natos_response | NATO]] from the conflict in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

## [[Hybrid warfare and NATOs response | NATO's Response]]
[[hybrid_warfare_and_natos_response | NATO]] has stated that it takes the threat of [[hybrid_warfare_and_natos_response | hybrid operations]] and cyber attacks seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. Secretary General Stoltenberg has indicated that [[hybrid_warfare_and_natos_response | NATO]] could invoke Article 5, the collective defense clause, in response to a serious cyber attack on a member state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

> [!QUOTE] NATO's Stance on Cyber Attacks
> Stoltenberg noted that [[hybrid_warfare_and_natos_response | NATO]] would warn Moscow about the potential use of Article 5 if a serious cyber attack occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. The response could involve not only cyberspace but also "other areas" to protect [[hybrid_warfare_and_natos_response | NATO]] allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. An armed attack on one [[hybrid_warfare_and_natos_response | NATO]] member country is considered an attack on the alliance as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

## Risks and Deterrence
There is concern that [[hybrid_warfare_and_natos_response | NATO]] might initially respond with "deep concern" and calls for restraint rather than a tough response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. This apprehension stems from Russia's potential declaration that [[hybrid_warfare_and_natos_response | NATO]]'s counter-cyber attacks or responses in other areas could justify Russia's use of nuclear weapons, including tactical nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. While the current Russian leadership may not intend to use nuclear weapons, it does engage in nuclear vocabulary, rhetoric, and blackmail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. This exchange of threats constitutes a form of blackmail between parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.

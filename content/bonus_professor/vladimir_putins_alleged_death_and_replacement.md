Concerns and questions surrounding the health and status of [[Vladimir Putins health and political future | Vladimir Putin]], particularly allegations of his death and replacement by a double, are frequently addressed.

## Allegations of Death and Replacement
According to statements, [[Vladimir Putins alleged death | Putin]] has been dead since at least October 26 of last year and has been replaced by a double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This assertion suggests that the recent Russian presidential elections were won by a double, rendering them inherently illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The elections are more accurately described as an "approval procedure," which was initially illegal by definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Furthermore, even under these conditions, the double allegedly did not secure more than 50% of the votes according to "Hamburg," with official numbers being described as "lies and falsification" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The "late President Putin" is also referenced in relation to past policies regarding immigrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a> and as an enemy of Prigozhin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

### Ukraine's Awareness
The head of Ukrainian intelligence, Budanov, reportedly spoke about [[allegations_of_putins_double | Putin's doubles]] a year prior, though he no longer raises the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. It is believed that the Ukrainian leadership is aware of [[speculation_on_putins_death_and_political_implications | Putin's alleged death]], but how they utilize this knowledge is their decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

### Impact on Military Actions
A common question arises: if the "real Putin" started the "special military operation" and is now deceased, why do military actions continue? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a> The current powers are interested in continuing military actions to prolong and strengthen their own power on favorable terms, seeing it as a matter of securing positions for future peace deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

### Shifting Power Dynamics
Before [[Vladimir Putins alleged death | Putin's death]], influential figures like the Kovalchuks, Rotenbergs, and Timchenko held significant sway without formal government positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:29">[00:31:29]</a>. Patrushev maintains his influence, which is now not solely limited to the Chemezov group, as the latter has become equally influential, particularly in socio-economic policy implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>.

### International Recognition
The United States' recognition of [[Vladimir Putins leadership and opposition forces | Putin]] as the President of Russia is seen as a reflection of the reality that Russians themselves recognize him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>. The argument suggests that if Russians "like to live with a double" and "not see the obvious," the U.S. State Department sees no reason to impose its opinion or "open their eyes," as such an act would likely be met with offense and denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>.

### Personnel Reshuffles and Alleged Relatives
Recent personnel reshuffles, such as those in the Ministry of Defense, are interpreted as a "smokescreen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>. Questions about [[vladimir_putins_policies_and_impact | Putin's]] "cousin" being appointed to the Ministry of Defense are seen as attempts to prove he is alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>. However, it is noted that the "alive Vladimir Vladimirovich" never appointed relatives to government positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>. The completion of his alleged palace in Gelendzhik is also presented as part of this "smokescreen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.

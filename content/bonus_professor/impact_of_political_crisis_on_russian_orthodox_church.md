The future of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) and its current leader, Patriarch Kirill, is expected to be significantly impacted by the conclusion of the "special military operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Expected Consequences for the Church

The end of the military operation is anticipated to trigger a very serious and large-scale [[potential_political_crisis_in_russia | political crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. During this period of [[political_crisis_and_instability_in_russia | political crisis]], all institutions, structures, and individuals holding high positions in the current government are expected to suffer significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This includes the primates of the Russian Orthodox Church, such as Patriarch Kirill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

It is predicted that the church itself will emerge from this crisis "very much suffered and ragged" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. It is expected to lose its "cheap gloss" and the "fat" it gained at the expense of "alms or rich pasta" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

## Integration into State Propaganda

The Russian Orthodox Church is deeply integrated into the general propaganda against Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This is evident from the discourse of the Primate of the ROC, Patriarch Kirill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. He reportedly "instantly shuts up all those priests who are trying to raise their voice against the armed confrontation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

## Reaction to Ukrainian Orthodox Church Abolition

The Russian authorities' reaction to the abolition of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate in Ukraine is negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. However, the Russian authorities and the Russian Orthodox Church are unable to take any real, concrete action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. They can only "complain," "groan," and attempt to incorporate this narrative into the broader propaganda discourse of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. This effort is largely unsuccessful because the Russian public is not very interested in what is happening in Ukraine, unless it directly affects their close relatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Their primary concerns are their own growing sorrows, problems, and illnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

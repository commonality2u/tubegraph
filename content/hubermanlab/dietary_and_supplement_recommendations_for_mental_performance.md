In a recent episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman discussed various dietary and supplement strategies designed to enhance mental performance. Below is a summary of the key points from the episode, addressing how specific dietary habits and supplements can support cognitive function and overall brain health.

## Protein and Fasting for Focus

Dr. Huberman emphasized the importance of protein intake and [[roles_of_fasting_and_eating_schedules_on_metabolism | fasting]] to maintain a state of alertness and focus, especially during the initial part of the day. His typical approach involves:

1. **Fasting**: Delaying the first meal until around noon. This practice increases levels of adrenaline in the brain and body, enhancing alertness and focus, particularly for cerebral tasks such as writing and analyzing.

2. **Low-Carbohydrate Meals**: Eating a lunch comprised mainly of proteins and healthy fats. Carbohydrates are kept low to maintain this alert state, avoiding the lethargy often associated with high-carb meals.

3. **Caffeine Timing**: Delaying caffeine intake by 90 to 120 minutes after waking helps avoid afternoon crashes by allowing adenosine to clear before [[caffeine_as_a_mental_and_physical_performance_enhancer | caffeine]] is introduced.

## Supplements for Mental Performance

Huberman discusses several supplements that may aid in cognitive function, along with the importance of [[the_role_of_omega3_fatty_acids | omega-3 fatty acids]] for mood and mental health.

### Omega-3 Fatty Acids

- **EPA-Dominated Omega-3**: Consuming at least 1,000 milligrams of EPA (Eicosapentaenoic acid) per day can act similarly to antidepressants, improving mood and supporting brain health.

### Magnesium, Apigenin, and Theanine

These compounds can help with relaxation and sleep, which are crucial for optimal mental performance.

- **Magnesium Threonate / Bisglycinate**: Promotes relaxation by enhancing GABA activity in the brain.
  - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:11">[01:51:11]</a>

- **Apigenin**: Found in chamomile, aids in calming the mind and reducing anxiety, which is beneficial for sleep.
  - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:42">[01:52:42]</a>

- **Theanine**: Known for promoting relaxation and reducing stress without causing sedation.

### Yerba Mate and Guayusa

- These teas are highlighted for their caffeine content and ability to boost focus and increase [[effects_of_caffeine_glp1_and_other_compounds_on_fat_oxidation | fat oxidation]].

### Experimental Supplements for Neuroprotection

Huberman touched on a couple of experimental compounds for their potential in supporting hormone production beneficial to cognitive function:

- **Tongkat Ali**: Can increase free testosterone which supports cognitive function.
  - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:15">[01:21:15]</a>

- **Fadogia Agrestis**: Increases luteinizing hormone, potentially enhancing testosterone and estrogen production.

## Conclusion

Dr. Hubermanâ€™s recommendations for enhancing mental performance center around strategic fasting, protein-rich low-carb meals, and specific supplements aimed at improving focus, energy levels, and mood. These protocols, grounded in neuroscience and peer-reviewed research, provide practical strategies for [[optimizing_cognitive_function_and_brain_health | achieving heightened cognitive function]] and overall brain health.

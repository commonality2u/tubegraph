In a recent episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman hosted Dr. Lori Santos, a professor of cognitive science and psychology at Yale University, to discuss various strategies for achieving and maintaining happiness. Among the topics covered, Dr. Santos provided insights into the practices of gratitude and delight, emphasizing their impact on emotional well-being.

## The Science of Gratitude

Gratitude has long been touted as a powerful emotional tool, but Dr. Santos explained that shifting our orientation from gratitude to focusing on what delights us may tap more effectively into the mechanisms that foster long-lasting happiness. This subtle distinction could transform how we perceive our daily experiences and affect our overall emotional state [[science_of_happiness_and_emotions | impact on emotions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## The Practice of Delight

Delight involves noticing and savoring the small joys that occur throughout the day. Dr. Santos suggests maintaining a daily Delight practice, perhaps by using a notes app or sharing with a friend, to consciously acknowledge and record delightful moments. This practice helps train the brain to be on the lookout for these positive experiences [[neuroplasticity_and_memory_formation | memory formation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

The emphasis is not just on recognizing these delightful moments, but also on experiencing the sensory and emotional richness they bring. According to Dr. Santos, the act of sharing delights with others can further enhance this positivity, as it reinforces social bonds and amplifies the emotional impact [[role_of_social_connections_in_happiness | social connections in happiness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>.

## Differences Between Gratitude and Delight

While gratitude practices typically involve reflecting on what one is thankful for, delight focuses more on in-the-moment pleasures and surprises. Delight does not require a shift in conscious thought or a reevaluation of one's emotions, making it a more spontaneous and less structured practice [[understanding_and_cultivating_generative_drive | generative drive and behavior]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:22">[01:23:22]</a>.

## Implementing Delight in Daily Life

1. **Keep a Delight Journal**: Record at least three delightful moments each day.
2. **Share Delights**: Communicate with a friend or loved one about the delights you experience, fostering social connection and mutual positivity.
3. **Embrace Sensory Experiences**: Pay attention to small sensory pleasures like the fresh smell of coffee or the beauty of a sunset [[impact_of_sensory_experiences_on_emotions | sensory impact on emotions]].
4. **Be Present**: Mindfulness can help in truly experiencing and amplifying those moments of delight [[mindfulness_and_meditation_practices | mindfulness practices]].

As Dr. Santos argued, delight can serve as an effective tool not just for achieving happiness but also for maintaining it over time. By training oneself to notice and appreciate small moments of joy, individuals can incrementally shift their focus from daily stresses to enduring sources of happiness [[sciencebased_tools_for_managing_stress | tools for managing stress]].

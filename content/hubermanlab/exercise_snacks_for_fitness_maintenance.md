Exercise snacks are a unique and efficient method to maintain and even enhance fitness levels, especially for those with busy schedules or limited time for traditional workouts. Dr. Andy Galpin introduced this concept and emphasized its effectiveness in preventing fitness declines and boosting overall health. Below, we explore the nature, benefits, and implementation of exercise snacks based on discussions from the Huberman Lab podcast.

## What Are Exercise Snacks?

Exercise snacks are short bouts of physical activity integrated into daily routines. They are designed to be quick and easy, requiring minimal equipment and no special preparations. These snacks can be categorized into two main types:

1. **Cardiovascular Fitness Snacks**: Brief activities that improve or maintain cardiovascular endurance, which is crucial considering the [[importance_of_cardiovascular_exercise_for_health | importance of cardiovascular exercise for health]], for activities lasting 12 minutes or longer. Examples include:
   - 100 jumping jacks at your desk, which can take between 30 to 90 seconds depending on speed and form. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:55">[00:46:55]</a>
   - Ascending and descending a stairwell briskly for about 20 to 40 seconds. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>

2. **Muscular Endurance Snacks**: Exercises focusing on maintaining static holds or performing reps to enhance muscular endurance over short periods, typically between 1 to 3 minutes. Examples include:
   - Wall sits or air squats held up to the point of muscular fatigue, which aligns with protocols found in [[sciencebased_protocols_for_muscle_hypertrophy | science-based protocols for muscle hypertrophy]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>
   - Maximal push-ups done consecutively to test and improve endurance. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>

In a recent episode of the Huberman Lab podcast, Andrew Huberman and his guest Ari Wallach delved into the fascinating topic of how technology is reshaping our perception of time. This discussion reveals insightful perspectives on how modern technology, particularly digital and social media, influences our temporal awareness and behavior.

## The Nature of Time Perception

The human brain has a unique capacity to perceive time. It allows us to think about the past, present, and future, enabling what Wallach refers to as "mental time travel." This ability is integral to setting and achieving goals, as it involves projecting current decisions into future outcomes [[neuroscience_of_goal_setting_and_achievement | neuroscience of goal setting and achievement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. However, according to Huberman and Wallach, advances in technology have significantly impacted this intrinsic capability [[impact_of_technology_on_human_experience | impact of technology on human experience]].

## Technology's Role in the Present

Wallach explains that the current technological landscape, characterized by instant information and immediate gratification, often restricts our time perception to the present. The pervasive nature of notifications and digital interactions promotes a "presentism" mindset, where individuals focus intensively on immediate rewards at the expense of considering long-term implications [[the_impact_of_social_media_on_focus | impact of social media on focus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

Huberman notes that this shift has profound psychological effects, as the bombardment of stimuli from technology can elicit a stimulus-response mode akin to a constant state of alertness, which limits the brain's ability to engage in broader temporal awareness [[neuroscience_of_perception_and_time | neuroscience of perception and time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

## Time Perception and Narrative

Part of this phenomenon is linked to the narrative structures embedded in new media. Wallach points out the popularity of dystopian narratives among young audiences, reflecting broader societal concerns about the future [[neurobiology_of_emotional_development | neurobiology of emotional development]]. This obsession with dystopian themes may be interpreted as a manifestation of collective anxiety about technological and environmental futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

These narratives influence how individuals conceptualize time, contributing to a general perception that the future is largely bleak unless sagely managed—a responsibility historically entrusted to humanity's great thinkers and leaders [[impact_of_technology_and_media_influence_on_mental_health | impact of technology and media influence on mental health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:31">[01:45:31]</a>.

## Implications for Society

Wallach emphasizes the need for what he terms "long path thinking," a conscious effort to extend our temporal awareness and responsibility beyond immediate gratification to consider future generations. He advocates for a deliberate shift in individual and collective thinking patterns to cultivate empathy for future selves and descendants [[longterm_thinking_and_future_planning | long-term thinking and future planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

In alignment with this long path mindset, Huberman underscores the importance of creating proactive time capsules—literal or metaphorical markers—that anchor our present actions to desired future outcomes. This can include practices like writing letters to future selves or maintaining a physical representation of future generations [[strategies_for_building_a_positive_legacy | strategies for building a positive legacy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

This episode of the Huberman Lab podcast offers a compelling examination of how modern technology influences time perception. By encouraging a mindful approach to our temporal experience—balancing present demands with future aspirations—we can harness technology's potential without succumbing to its pitfalls. Through embracing a future-oriented mindset and engaging in practices that link present actions to long-term goals, individuals and societies can navigate technological influences in a way that promotes both personal and collective well-being.

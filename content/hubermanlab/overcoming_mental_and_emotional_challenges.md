## The Onset of Challenges

Ruiz's journey into understanding and overcoming his mental and emotional challenges began years after leaving the Navy SEALs. Despite a highly successful career in the military, including serving in tier one special operations, Ruiz encountered profound emotional distress that took him by surprise [[the_impact_of_military_service_on_mental_health]]. He recounts a period of severe depression, describing it as a physically and emotionally exhausting experience. This "low-grade pain," as he terms it, accumulated over years of exposure to high-stress environments and personal loss, eventually demanding his attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:20">[02:24:20]</a>.

## Seeking Help

The turning point came when Ruiz decided to seek help through therapy [[therapeutic_approaches_for_trauma]]. Initially resistant, describing the idea of therapy as more daunting than operational challenges in combat, he eventually accepted that professional assistance was crucial. He found therapy to be profoundly beneficial, and it became a cornerstone of his recovery process. His therapist helped him process years of accumulated stress and trauma, a journey that Ruiz describes as essential for his healing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:08">[02:21:08]</a>.

## The Role of Psychedelics

An interesting component of Ruiz’s recovery involved the controlled use of psychedelics, specifically 5-MeO-DMT and ibogaine, through a legal and supervised program [[psychedelics_for_depression_and_ptsd_treatment]]. This experience provided him with profound insights into his psyche and connected him with the historical and spiritual elements of warrior cultures. However, these experiences were not a panacea and were followed by a challenging period of emotional destabilization, underscoring that psychedelics should not be seen as a standalone solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:03">[02:14:03]</a>.

## Building a Support System

A critical aspect of Ruiz’s journey was building a reliable support system. Close friends and family played an instrumental role in his recovery [[the_role_of_mentorship_and_support_systems]]. Sharing his struggles with trusted individuals allowed him to receive the support and encouragement necessary to persist through the darkest times. His story highlights the importance of vulnerability and openness in fostering strong support networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:27">[02:27:27]</a>.

## Embracing a New Life Philosophy

Through therapy and self-reflection, Ruiz developed a new philosophy towards life [[role_of_meditation_and_selfreflection_in_personal_growth]]. He learned the importance of balance, maintaining physical health, and nurturing emotional resilience. He emphasizes the significance of stepping back and aligning one's life with broader perspectives [[finding_ones_unique_purpose]], a concept supported by reading and integrating philosophical insights, including the hero’s journey as described by Joseph Campbell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:41">[02:59:41]</a>.

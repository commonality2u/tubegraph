## Differentiating Microdosing and Macrodosing Psychedelics

In recent years, the use of psychedelics has gained traction in both therapeutic settings and popular culture. Two terms frequently arise in these discussions: **microdosing** and **macrodosing**. Understanding the difference between these two dosing approaches is crucial, especially in exploring their potential [[therapeutic_potential_of_psychedelics_in_mental_health | therapeutic benefits and effects on mental health]].

### What is Microdosing?

Microdosing refers to the administration of sub-perceptual amounts of a psychedelic substance, such as LSD or psilocybin, over a period of time. According to Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris, a notable researcher in the field, a microdose is typically a classic psychedelic dose that leads to some perceptible changes but does not induce a noticeable altered state of consciousness that feels like "tripping" (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>). For example, a threshold dose of LSD is around 10 to 12 micrograms, which some microdosing advocates consider the upper limit for microdoses (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>).

Dr. Carhart-Harris explains that some proponents, like Jim Fadiman, advocate for sub-perceptible microdoses, asserting their influence on behavior, cognition, and well-being without the subjective psychedelic experience (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>). However, compelling scientific evidence to support the efficacy of microdosing is still lacking. Studies have struggled with methodological challenges, such as maintaining placebo controls and logistical issues in administering these types of protocols (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>).

### What is Macrodosing?

In contrast, macrodosing involves administrating a full, perceptible dose of a psychedelic, strong enough to induce a recognizable psychedelic experience, which includes hallucinations and an altered state of consciousness (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>). For psilocybin, a commonly studied dose in clinical settings is 25 milligrams, known for its significant psychoactive effects (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>).

Macrodosing is often explored in clinical studies focused on treating mental health conditions, where the therapeutic effects are thought to result largely from the profound experience induced by a full psychedelic journey or trip. Dr. Carhart-Harris points to abundant data demonstrating robust therapeutic outcomes linked to the intensity of the psychedelic experience, suggesting that the therapeutic benefits correlate with the subjective depth of the experience (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>).

### Key Differences and Considerations

1. **Perceptual Experience**: Microdoses are designed to avoid intense hallucinations or noticeable altered awareness, whereas macrodoses deliberately elicit such states to drive therapy and introspection.

2. **Therapeutic Application**: Macrodosing is more thoroughly explored in clinical research, with evidence indicating significant benefits for conditions like depression, PTSD, and more. Microdosing remains less substantiated, with ongoing debates about its psychological and cognitive benefits (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>).

3. **Actual Doses**: In terms of psilocybin mushrooms, a rough estimate is that a gram contains about 10 milligrams of psilocybin, which would not suffice for a macrodose but might exceed a microdose threshold if concentrated or purified to some extent (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>).

### Conclusion

The differentiation between microdosing and macrodosing is pivotal in the context of [[psychedelic_research_and_therapeutic_use | psychedelic research and its application in mental health]]. While macrodosing is backed by a growing body of evidence demonstrating significant therapeutic benefits, microdosing continues to be a topic of interest and debate, requiring further scientific exploration to validate its purported benefits. As more research unfolds, the nuances of these dosing strategies will likely become clearer, guiding both practitioners and users in their therapeutic endeavors.

## The Transition from Military to Civilian Life

After leaving the military in 2011, Ruiz found himself in unfamiliar territory. Accustomed to the structured environment of military life, he experienced a sense of displacement upon entering civilian life, describing it as standing on a "24-hour ledge" without knowing what to do with his time and energy (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>). The structured life he knew in the Navy was no more, and the decision to leave was made quickly, yet it was one he never regretted.

## Coping Mechanisms and Challenges

In his post-military journey, Coleman grappled with finding a balance between personal development and professional obligations. He detailed how initial attempts to adjust were fraught with challenges, both mentally and physically, as he struggled to find a routine and purpose outside the military (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:30">[02:56:30]</a>).

Despite the successes and hopes that accompanied his military achievements, Ruiz described a pervasive "low-grade pain" and struggling with feelings of isolation and depression. This culminated in a severe depressive episode, where he realized the necessity of seeking professional help, including therapy and short-term pharmacological support (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>).

## Professional Life and Finding Stability

Professionally, Ruiz’s post-military career involved roles in private equity and serving as a Chief Operating Officer for Lids Sports Group. This position allowed him to apply his leadership skills in a civilian context, emphasizing the importance of structure and purpose, which were integral parts of his military experience (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:45">[03:11:45]</a>).

Establishing a balance between personal healing and professional responsibilities required making significant lifestyle changes. Physical fitness remained a cornerstone of his daily routine, providing a sense of stability and normalcy. Through regular exercise, meditation, and a healthy diet, Ruiz found ways to manage the physical and emotional echoes of his combat experiences, fostering resilience against the challenges of civilian life (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:47">[02:59:47]</a>).

This acceptance marked a pivotal moment in his recovery and adjustment process (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>).

Ruiz’s openness to embracing therapy and the support of family and friends was fundamental in his journey back to stability and balance. His story underscores the necessity for veterans to have access to mental health resources and the importance of creating environments that encourage seeking help, reflecting the [[the_role_of_mentorship_and_support_systems | role of mentorship and support systems]].

In a recent episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman discussed various supplements and their effects on enhancing libido and desire. The episode delved into the roles of hormones such as testosterone and estrogen and how different supplements could influence these hormones and the broader systems involved in sexual drive and performance.

## Key Supplements for Libido Enhancement

Dr. Huberman highlighted three main supplements, each backed by varying levels of scientific research, and explained their potential effects on libido and sexual desire:

### 1. **Maca**

Maca is a root typically found in powder or capsule form. Research indicates that consuming Maca at a dosage of 2 to 3 grams per day may significantly increase libido without altering serum testosterone or estrogen levels [[testosterone_and_estrogen_balance | testosterone and estrogen balance]]. It is particularly notable for counteracting sexual dysfunction induced by SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor) medications.

> *Study Highlight:* A pilot study conducted at Mass General reported improvements in sexual desire at doses ranging from 1.5 to 3 grams per day in patients experiencing SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

### 2. **Tongkat Ali**

Known as Eurycoma longifolia or Longjack, Tongkat Ali is particularly effective in increasing free testosterone levels by lowering sex hormone-binding globulin [[supplementation_for_hormone_health | supplementation for hormone health]]. This modulation can lead to enhanced libido, as reported in several studies. Dr. Huberman recommends Indonesian Tongkat Ali, which is considered to be the most potent.

> *Research Note:* Studies have shown significant improvements in libido and sexual function with regular consumption of 400mg of Tongkat Ali daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:30">[02:26:30]</a>.

### 3. **Tribulus Terrestris**

Tribulus Terrestris, often touted for boosting testosterone, appears to have varying effects on libido based on the population [[impact_of_lifestyle_factors_on_male_sexual_health | lifestyle factors on male sexual health]]. Some studies report increases in sexual desire without significant changes in testosterone levels. Others, particularly in postmenopausal women, note improved sexual desire with enhanced free testosterone levels when taking Tribulus supplements.

## Considerations and Recommendations

While supplements like Maca, Tongkat Ali, and Tribulus Terrestris have shown promise for enhancing libido, Dr. Huberman advises consulting with healthcare professionals before beginning any supplement regimen. It's essential to consider individual health conditions and potential interactions with other medications or supplements [[rational_approach_to_supplementation | rational approach to supplementation]].

In conclusion, while there are practical and scientifically supported supplements to enhance libido, it's essential to approach supplementation with informed caution, leveraging both physiological needs and personal health conditions.

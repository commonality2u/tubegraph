Exercising not only benefits physical health but also significantly impacts brain function. The relationship between various types of exercise and brain health is an increasingly studied field, with numerous research studies investigating how exercise affects brain longevity and performance. This article aims to explain the impact of different types of exercise on brain function, drawing insights from the [Huberman Lab Podcast](https://hubermanlab.com) hosted by Andrew Huberman.

## Cardiovascular Exercise

Cardiovascular (cardio) exercise, which increases heart rate and improves circulation, is categorized into several types based on intensity and duration.

### High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)

- **Definition**: HIIT involves short bursts of intense exercise followed by brief periods of rest or less intense activity.
- **Impact on Brain**: HIIT is shown to acutely improve cognitive performance, memory tasks, and executive functions. These benefits are attributed to increased levels of autonomic arousal and enhanced cerebral blood flow, which deliver more blood and fuel to the brain during and after the exercise. Importantly, the body produces lactate during intense exercise, which is a powerful appetite suppressant and enhances brain function by acting on brain cells and the blood-brain barrier.

### Long Slow Distance (Zone Two) Training

- **Definition**: This type is characterized by prolonged, steady-state cardio at a moderate intensity level where one can still talk but not sing.
- **Impact on Brain**: Improves cardiovascular health, which in turn enhances cerebral blood flow and brain function. Ongoing cardiovascular exercise can support long-term brain health and slow down age-related cognitive decline.

## Resistance Training

Resistance training involves exercises that improve muscle strength and endurance.

- **Single Joint Isolation Exercises**: These exercises target specific muscles and are useful for people less accustomed to training, including the elderly. Research suggests even such minimal exercises can benefit brain health by enhancing brain performance and longevityâ€”though compound exercises are more frequently studied.

- **Compound Exercises**: Involving multiple joints, exercises like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses more effectively engage the core muscles, increasing adrenaline production and subsequent arousal. The conscious control over movements further increases neuromodulators in the brain, enhancing learning and memory capabilities.

## Osteocalcin Release Through Bone Loading

The impact of exercise on brain function extends beyond muscles and cardiovascular systems to bones.

- During mechanical stress, bones release a hormone called osteocalcin, which can travel to the brain and enhance learning and memory by fostering the growth of neurons in the hippocampus. [[hippocampus_and_its_role_in_memory | Hippocampus and its role in memory]]. Osteocalcin promotes the effects of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which supports memory encoding and retention over time. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>

## Practical Applications

Exercise profoundly impacts brain function acutely and chronically. To optimize brain health:

- **Include Cardiovascular Training**: Incorporate both HIIT and long-distance cardio weekly to cover immediate and long-term brain health benefits.
- **Integrate Resistance Exercises**: Ensure a mixture of isolation and compound exercises to engage different muscle groups and brain activities.
- **Engage in Bone Loading Activities**: Include exercises that stress the bones safely, like jumping or controlled landings, to stimulate osteocalcin release.

By understanding how different types of exercise affect brain function, individuals can tailor their exercise routines to maximize cognitive benefits alongside physical improvements, achieving healthier, longer-lasting effects on overall brain health.

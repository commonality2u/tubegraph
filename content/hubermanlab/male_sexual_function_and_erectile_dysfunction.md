Male sexual function is a critical aspect of men's health, encompassing a wide range of physiological and psychological factors. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common condition affecting men's ability to achieve and maintain an erection suitable for sexual activity, and it serves as a critical indicator of men's overall health [[sexual_health_misconceptions_and_dysfunction | Inline Text]]. Dr. Michael Eisenberg, a renowned urologist and expert in male sexual health, provides insights into the causes and treatments for erectile dysfunction.

## Understanding Erectile Dysfunction

Erectile dysfunction is defined as the inability to consistently achieve and maintain an erection [[impact_of_lifestyle_factors_on_male_sexual_health | Inline Text]]. It is a common condition, especially in men over 40, affecting more than half of this demographic. Under age 40, it is estimated to affect 15-20% of men [[impact_of_lifestyle_factors_on_male_sexual_health | Inline Text]].

### Causes of Erectile Dysfunction

The causes of erectile dysfunction are predominantly organic rather than psychological, which was the prevailing belief decades ago. The main causes include:

1. **Vascular Issues**: This is the most common cause of ED, tied to conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, and atherosclerosis [[atherosclerosis_and_its_risk_factors | Inline Text]]. Essentially, anything that affects blood flow to the end organs can result in erectile dysfunction.

2. **Endocrine Problems**: While it may seem that testosterone deficiency would be a major cause [[role_of_testosterone_and_estrogen_in_mens_and_womens_health | Inline Text]], hormonal issues account for only a small fraction (less than 10%) of ED cases.

3. **Pelvic Cancer Treatments**: Surgeries and radiotherapies for pelvic cancers can also lead to erectile dysfunction due to damage to the nerves and blood vessels in the area [[cancer_prevention_and_screening | Inline Text]].

## Treatment for Erectile Dysfunction

Dr. Eisenberg outlines a variety of treatments for erectile dysfunction, emphasizing that options are available for all men, regardless of the underlying cause [[treatments_and_supplements_for_sexual_function | Inline Text]].

### Oral Medications

The first line of treatment often involves oral medications such as sildenafil (Viagra) and tadalafil (Cialis). These phosphodiesterase inhibitors help increase blood flow to the penis, addressing about 60-70% of ED cases [[treatments_and_supplements_for_sexual_function | Inline Text]].

### Alternative Treatments

For those who do not respond well to oral medications, other options include:

- **Urethral Suppositories**: Alprostadil can be administered directly into the urethra to help stimulate an erection by dilating blood vessels.
- **Penile Injections**: These involve self-administered injections directly into the penis before sexual activity, which produce an erection by increasing blood flow (efficacy is around 80-90%) [[treatments_and_supplements_for_sexual_function | Inline Text]].

### Surgical Options

For severe cases, penile implants are considered. These implants can be either non-inflatable (rigid) or inflatable, providing a mechanical solution to ED [[treatments_and_supplements_for_sexual_function | Inline Text]].

## Key Takeaways

Erectile dysfunction is a sign of broader health concerns, particularly cardiovascular health [[endurance_training_and_cardiovascular_health | Inline Text]]. Men experiencing ED should consider undergoing further health evaluations to check for other potential conditions, such as heart disease [[atherosclerosis_and_its_risk_factors | Inline Text]]. Despite the stigma, effective treatments are available, and men experiencing these symptoms should seek professional medical advice [[treatments_and_supplements_for_sexual_function | Inline Text]].

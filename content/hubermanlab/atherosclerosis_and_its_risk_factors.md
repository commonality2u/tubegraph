Atherosclerosis is a condition characterized by the buildup of fats, cholesterol, and other substances in and on the artery walls. This buildup is commonly referred to as plaque, which can restrict blood flow or burst, leading to serious health complications such as heart attacks or strokes. Dr. Peter Attia, a renowned medical expert on [[healthspan_and_longevity_strategies | health span, vitality, and longevity]], offers deep insights into atherosclerosis and its major risk factors during his discussion with Andrew Huberman on the Huberman Lab podcast.

## Understanding Atherosclerosis

Atherosclerosis stems from the deposition of cholesterol and other substances in the arteries. These deposits can harden over time, causing the arteries to narrow and lose their elasticity. As the arteries become narrowed, it becomes more challenging for blood to flow through them, which can result in limited oxygen supply to vital organs and tissues. This condition is a significant contributor to cardiovascular diseases, including heart attacks and strokes.

## Major Risk Factors

Dr. Peter Attia highlights three primary risk factors that contribute to the development of atherosclerosis:

### 1. **Blood Pressure**

Maintaining healthy blood pressure is crucial for preventing atherosclerosis. High blood pressure exerts extra force against the artery walls, which can cause damage over time. Dr. Attia emphasizes keeping blood pressure within the range of 120/80 mm Hg or lower to mitigate the risk of arterial damage.

- **Recommendation:** Regularly monitor blood pressure, engage in regular physical activity, and maintain a balanced diet to keep blood pressure in check. (Timecode: <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>)

### 2. **Smoking**

Smoking is detrimental to endothelial health, which is the tissue lining the arteries. The chemicals in tobacco smoke play a significant role in damaging the lining of the arteries and accelerating the process of atherosclerosis. Dr. Attia categorically advises against any form of smoking, including vaping, as they both pose significant health risks.

- **Recommendation:** Avoid tobacco in all its forms, including cigarettes and vaping. Consider alternatives like nicotine patches or gums if managing nicotine cravings. (Timecode: <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>)

### 3. **ApoB Levels**

ApoB (Apolipoprotein B) is a primary protein in LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, which is often termed "bad" cholesterol. High levels of apoB are indicative of a higher number of LDL particles, which contribute to plaque buildup in the arteries.

- **Recommendation:** Dr. Attia stresses the importance of measuring apoB levels rather than relying solely on cholesterol levels to assess cardiovascular risk. Key interventions may include dietary changes, increased physical activity, and possibly pharmacotherapy to manage apoB levels. (Timecode: <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>)

## Conclusion

Atherosclerosis remains a major health concern, significantly influencing global mortality rates due to heart disease and strokes. Understanding and managing its risk factors—blood pressure, smoking, and apoB levels—can greatly reduce the risk of developing serious cardiovascular diseases. Regular health checkups, lifestyle changes, and informed discussions with healthcare providers can help manage these risk factors effectively.

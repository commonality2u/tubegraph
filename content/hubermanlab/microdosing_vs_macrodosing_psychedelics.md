In recent years, [[therapeutic_potential_of_psychedelics_in_mental_health | psychedelics]] have gained significant attention in both scientific research and popular culture. Dr. Matthew Johnson from Johns Hopkins University, a leading expert in the field, discusses the different approaches to psychedelic dosing, specifically [[differentiating_microdosing_and_macrodosing_psychedelics | microdosing and macrodosing]], and addresses the potential benefits and challenges of each.

## What is Microdosing?

Microdosing involves taking sub-perceptual amounts of a psychedelic substance, typically about a tenth of a full dose. It is intended to improve mood, creativity, or focus without producing the hallucinogenic effects associated with higher doses. In practice, for substances like LSD, microdoses are in the range of 10-20 micrograms, whereas for psilocybin (magic mushrooms), it could be around a quarter to half a gram of dried mushrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:38">[01:39:38]</a>.

### Claims of Benefits

Proponents of microdosing suggest it may act as an alternative to medications for ADHD or depression, claiming enhanced focus and mood stability [[understanding_adhd_and_focus | Understanding ADHD and Focus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:16">[01:46:16]</a>. However, Dr. Johnson notes that scientific studies have not yet robustly supported these claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. The data from controlled studies either show no significant effects or only slight impairments in cognitive tasks such as time estimation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:30">[01:49:30]</a>.

### Concerns and Skepticism

Dr. Johnson highlights the potential for a strong placebo effect in microdosing regimens [[placebo_effects_and_their_impact_on_biology_and_psychology | placebo effects]]. Users have sometimes cut doses inconsistently, leading to unintentional full psychedelic trips, which underscores the necessity of accurate measurement and control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:55">[01:42:55]</a>. Additionally, long-term impacts of frequent microdosing on health, such as potential heart valve issues due to 5-HT2B receptor agonism, remain uncertain and warrant further investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:02">[01:55:02]</a>.

## What is Macrodosing?

Macrodosing refers to taking full or "heroic" doses of psychedelics, which induce intense [[the_role_of_psychedelics_in_consciousness | psychedelic experiences]]. These experiences are often used in controlled, clinical settings to treat conditions such as depression, PTSD, or addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:52">[01:38:52]</a>.

### Clinical Applications

In clinical research, macrodosing typically involves carefully calibrated doses, such as 20-30 milligrams of psilocybin, administered in a setting designed to maximize therapeutic outcome and safety. The goal is to produce profound changes in perception and introspection that could lead to lasting improvements in mental health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>.

### Therapeutic Benefits

Dr. Johnson emphasizes the potential of macrodosing to provide substantial and enduring therapeutic benefits [[psychotherapy_and_emotional_regulation | therapeutic benefits]], often from a single or a few sessions. The effects of macrodosing could last for months, significantly outperforming traditional treatments in some studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:11">[00:56:11]</a>.

## Conclusion

Both microdosing and macrodosing psychedelics have captured the interest of researchers and the public alike. While microdosing is popular for its alleged subtle benefits without overt hallucinatory effects, its efficacy remains scientifically unsubstantiated. In contrast, macrodosing in controlled settings shows promise for treating various psychiatric disorders [[psychedelics_for_treating_mental_disorders | psychiatric disorders]], though it requires rigorous oversight to ensure safety and efficacy. As research continues, clearer distinctions and guidelines will help refine the [[therapeutic_research_and_therapeutic_use | therapeutic potential of psychedelics]].

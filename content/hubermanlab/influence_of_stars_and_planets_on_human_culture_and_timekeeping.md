The relationship between celestial bodies such as stars and planets and human civilization is as ancient as humanity itself. The alignment of these celestial bodies has not only guided terrestrial navigation and agricultural activities but also significantly influenced human culture and timekeeping. Dr. Brian Keating, a professor of cosmology, elaborated on these influences during his discussion on the Huberman Lab podcast.

## Ancient Timekeeping and Astronomy

From ancient times, humans have relied on the stars to measure time and discern the passage of seasons. Early agrarian societies heavily depended on celestial cues to dictate planting and harvesting cycles. The movement of stars and planetary bodies served as a celestial calendar. Dr. Keating points out that this isn’t too abstract to believe since humans, from as far back as prehistory, recognized that constellations were visible at certain times of the year and absent at others. This was crucial for determining the times to plant and harvest crops, thus making it essential for survival and development of civilizations (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>).

## The Development of the Calendar

Many cultures structured their entire calendar systems around celestial events. For instance, Dr. Keating explains how the orientation of the Earth relative to the Sun and stars historically dictated religious rituals, festivals, and other significant cultural events. The ancient Greek word 'Cosmos', attributed to both cosmology and cosmetology, underscores the idea of order and beauty derived from celestial observation (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>). This etymological connection reflects how deeply ingrained celestial bodies are within the fabric of human society.

## The Role of Lunar Cycles

The Moon has held particular significance due to its observable phases, which have a cycle of approximately 29.5 days, closely aligning with the average menstrual cycle in humans. While no causative link has been scientifically proven, the Moon's consistent visibility and cyclical nature reinforced its role in early human timekeeping. Despite the absence of hard evidence linking lunar cycles to menstruation, both phenomena have traditionally been symbolically intertwined in various cultures (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:30">[02:23:30]</a>).

## Celestial Navigation

Beyond influencing terrestrial practices, celestial bodies have also been indispensable for navigation. Mariners, for example, utilized the North Star, Polaris, for centuries as a reliable guide for determining latitude in the Northern Hemisphere. Knowledge of star positions was essential for the explorations that significantly shaped human history and commerce. Dr. Keating highlights this by recounting historical ways in which celestial phenomena dictated navigation and exploration (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:22">[02:33:22]</a>).

## Celestial Events and Mythology

In addition to practical implications, celestial bodies have been central to the mythological narratives of numerous cultures. For example, constellations often appeared as animals or mythological figures, reflecting the stories and values of the societies that observed them. This cultural aspect further underlines the interconnectedness of astronomy with human belief systems. Dr. Keating discusses this by referencing how the Ancients perceived constellations as being causative of earthly events, a testament to the stars' enduring mystical allure (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>).

> [!info] Fun Fact
> Despite common misconceptions, neither astrology (the belief in the influence of stars on human destiny) nor other purported mystical influences of celestial bodies have any scientific basis. Dr. Keating humorously recounts encounters with misconceptions about astronomy and astrology, highlighting the critical difference between scientific observation and esoteric beliefs (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>).

In summary, the stars and planets have played a pivotal role in shaping human culture through practical applications and mythological stories. Their influence extends from the detailed development of timekeeping systems to guiding humanity’s understanding of the natural world. As science continues to advance, so too does our understanding of these celestial objects, further enriching their relevance in both cultural and scientific contexts.

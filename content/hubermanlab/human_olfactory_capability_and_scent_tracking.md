The human sense of smell, or olfaction, is often underestimated, especially in comparison to animals like dogs. However, Dr. Gnome Sobel, a renowned neurobiologist, has conducted fascinating research demonstrating that human olfactory capabilities are indeed remarkable. In this article, we'll explore key aspects of human scent detection and tracking as discussed in a conversation between Dr. Andrew Huberman and Dr. Sobel.

## The Power of Human Olfaction

While many assume animals like dogs have far superior olfactory abilities, Dr. Sobel's research highlights that humans possess an incredibly acute sense of smell. Humans can detect specific odorant molecules at concentrations as low as 0.2 parts per billion, a sensitivity on par with, if not exceeding, many sophisticated machines used for similar tasks (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>). This sensitivity allows humans to perceive a vast array of scents in their environment, demonstrating olfactory capabilities that are often underestimated.

## Demonstrating Scent Tracking Capabilities in Humans

One of the experiments highlighting human olfactory prowess involved participants accurately following a scent trail on hands and knees. During the study, individuals were deprived of visual and auditory cues, instructed to focus solely on olfactory input. Surprisingly, participants were able to improve their scent tracking accuracy significantly with practice and performed the task with high fidelity, similar to scent-tracking dogs (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>).

### The Experiment Setup

In these experiments, a fragrance-impregnated twine was buried beneath the soil, creating a scent trail invisible to the participants. By analyzing their nasal airflow patterns and other sensory data, the researchers could precisely track the participants' movements and sniffing behaviors (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>).

## The Importance of Sniffing Techniques

An interesting aspect of human olfactory functioning revolves around the mechanics of sniffing. Each nostril works independently, providing separate olfactory inputs that our brain processes to triangulate the source of a scent. This bilateral input significantly enhances our tracking abilities, as demonstrated when participants performed better using both nostrils rather than a single, combined nostril during scent tracking tasks [[role_of_smell_and_taste_in_human_biology | Role of smell and taste in human biology]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>).

## The Nasal Cycle

Humans experience a nasal cycle, where airflow alternates between nostrils approximately every two and a half hours [[nasal_cycle_and_its_connection_to_the_autonomic_nervous_system | Nasal cycle and its connection to the autonomic nervous system]]. This cycle can influence how effectively each nostril detects smells and has implications for the autonomic and olfactory processing systems within our brains (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a>).

## Conclusion

The profound human capability to detect and track scents challenges the common belief that humans are inferior to animals in this regard [[impact_of_smell_on_behavior_and_hormone_levels | Impact of smell on behavior and hormone levels]]. Through continued research, such as that conducted by Dr. Sobel and his team, our understanding of the human olfactory system's role in interacting with the world and our decision-making processes could reach new depths. It serves as a reminder that our olfactory sense is more vital and sophisticated than it's traditionally given credit for.

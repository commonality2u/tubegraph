In a recent episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman and Dr. Peter Attia delve into the complexities surrounding supplements such as NR (Nicotinamide Riboside), NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide), and NAD (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) and their potential roles in affecting [[healthspan_and_longevity_strategies | healthspan and lifespan]]. These molecules are often discussed in the context of longevity, but what's the [[science_of_aging_and_its_impact_on_health | science behind them]], and should you consider taking them?

## The Basics of NAD

NAD is a vital molecule found in nearly every cell of the body, playing a crucial role in energy production and various metabolic processes. It acts as a co-factor in redox reactions, helping to shuttle electrons during cellular respiration [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">00:25:28</a>]. Although NAD levels tend to decline with age, it's not entirely clear what impact this reduction has on health and longevity.

## NR and NMN: Building Blocks of NAD

NR and NMN are precursors to NAD, meaning they help increase NAD levels within cells. NR can cross cell membranes directly, while NMN requires conversion to NR to become effective [[impact_of_nervous_system_on_fat_metabolism | in energy metabolism processes]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">01:11:01</a>]. This biochemical processing is fundamental to the debate over which supplement might be more effective.

## Scientific Evidence and Criticisms

### Health Benefits

During the podcast, it was highlighted that some studies suggest NR could contribute to lowering inflammation and possibly affecting conditions like insulin sensitivity and fatty liver disease [[supplements_and_dietary_influences_on_brain_function | through metabolic interventions]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">01:25:01</a>]. Yet, results are often inconsistent or statistically insignificant when scrutinized deeper.

### Longevity

For longevity specifically, the Interventions Testing Program (ITP) evaluated the lifespan impact of NR in mice. It found no effect, contrasting sharply with the effects of rapamycin and caloric restriction, which have shown lifespan extension in similar models [[intermittent_fasting_and_lifespan_extension | linked to fasting and caloric management]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:04">01:16:04</a>].

## Dr. Attia's and Dr. Huberman's Perspectives

Both Dr. Attia and Dr. Huberman express skepticism regarding the ability of these supplements to extend lifespan, suggesting that the scientific backing is currently insufficient [[supplements_and_their_impact_on_aging | for claims on longevity enhancement]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:02">02:27:02</a>]. Dr. Attia does not include them in his personal regimen, underscoring the need for further evidence before making conclusive recommendations.

> Supplements like NR, NMN, and NAD are surrounded by a mix of scientific intrigue and commercial hype. While they do increase blood NAD levels, their real-world impact on lifespan and healthspan remains unproven [[roles_of_fasting_and_eating_schedules_in_health | in long-term health strategies]].

## Conclusion

While NR, NMN, and NAD supplementation might offer some health benefits, the promises related to extending lifespan remain largely hypothetical at this point [[role_of_sirtuins_and_epigenome_in_aging | in the context of epigenetic influences]]. For those interested in longevity, evidence-based lifestyle shifts, such as optimizing diet, exercise, and sleep, currently offer the most reliable outcomes [[exercise_and_physical_fitness_for_aging | in maintaining physical fitness with age]]. As research advances, it will be crucial to reevaluate these supplements to ascertain their true effect on human health.

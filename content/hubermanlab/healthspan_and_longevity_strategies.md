In a recent episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman hosted Dr. Peter Attiaâ€”a world-renowned expert in [[understanding_healthspan_and_longevity | healthspan, vitality, and longevity]]. Together, they discussed comprehensive strategies to extend one's healthspan and longevity, focusing on actionable insights to help individuals optimize their life quality and lifespan. Here, we summarize some of the key strategies and insights presented during their discussion.

## Understanding Healthspan and Longevity

**Healthspan** refers to the period of life spent in good health, free from the chronic diseases of aging. In contrast, **longevity** refers to lifespan, or the total years a person lives. Dr. Attia emphasizes that while both are crucial, healthspan should not be overlooked as it directly affects life quality.

### Lifespan vs. Healthspan

- **Lifespan**: The number of years an individual lives.
- **Healthspan**: Years free from disability and disease, encompassing physical, cognitive, and emotional domains.

Dr. Attia brings attention to the interconnectedness of physical and mental health, underscoring the importance of nurturing emotional well-being as part of a broader strategy towards [[emotional_health_and_personal_development | healthy longevity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Major Preventable Causes of Death

Dr. Attia delves into the seven major causes of death worldwide and outlines strategies to mitigate these risks. Here are some of the notable ones he discusses:

### 1. Cardiovascular and Cerebral Vascular Diseases

Dr. Attia explains that cardiovascular diseases, including those that affect the brain like strokes, are the leading cause of death worldwide. He stresses the importance of managing the following:

- **Blood Pressure Management**: Maintaining blood pressure around 120/80 mmHg is optimal, with higher levels warranting intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.
- **No Smoking**: Smoking drastically increases the risk of cardiovascular disease.
- **Apolipoprotein B (ApoB)**: Monitoring and managing ApoB levels can indicate [[atherosclerosis_and_its_risk_factors | cardiovascular risk]] and help prevent arterial diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.

### 2. Cancer

[[cancer_prevention_and_screening | Cancer]] remains a daunting health threat worldwide. Dr. Attia highlights several key strategies to mitigate risks:

- **Genetic Considerations**: While genetic mutations can predispose some individuals to cancer, they account for a small fraction.
- **Obesity and Insulin Resistance**: Combatting insulin resistance through proper nutrition and exercise helps reduce inflammation and cancer risk.
- **Screening**: Regular cancer screenings according to medical advice are essential for early detection and better treatment outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:03">[01:39:03]</a>.

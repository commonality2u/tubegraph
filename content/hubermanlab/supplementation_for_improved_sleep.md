In today's episode of The Huberman Lab Podcast, Andrew Huberman delves into various tools for optimizing sleep, emphasizing the role of supplementation in enhancing sleep quality. Below, we highlight key insights into the supplements discussed and their effects on sleep.

## The Core Sleep Supplement Stack

The primary supplements recommended for improving sleep quality include magnesium threonate, apigenin, and theanine. Together, these supplements can help individuals fall asleep more easily, stay asleep throughout the night, and enhance the overall restorative quality of sleep.

### Magnesium Threonate
- **Dosage**: Approximately 145 milligrams.
- **Benefits**: Helps in getting restful sleep by influencing neural functions and can aid in maintaining deep sleep stages.
- **Considerations**: About 5% of individuals may experience gastrointestinal disturbances such as diarrhea or gastric distress. If this occurs, it's recommended to discontinue use.

### Apigenin
- **Dosage**: Typically 50 milligrams.
- **Benefits**: Works synergistically with magnesium threonate and theanine to promote drowsiness and enhance sleep quality.

### Theanine
- **Dosage**: Ranges from 100 to 400 milligrams.
- **Benefits**: Facilitates falling asleep and entering deeper sleep states. 
- **Considerations**: Some may experience vividly intense dreams, which can be disruptive; in such cases, theanine should be reduced or avoided.

## Alternative Supplements

In addition to the primary stack, several other supplements can be used as alternatives or adjuncts, depending on individual needs.

### Glycine and GABA
- **Usage Frequency**: Every third or fourth night.
- **Dosage**: Two grams of glycine and 100 milligrams of GABA.
- **Effects**: When combined with the primary stack, these supplements can enhance sleep onset and quality. However, frequent use may reduce their effectiveness over time.

### Myo-Inositol
- **Usage**: Taken every other night.
- **Dosage**: 900 milligrams.
- **Benefits**: Particularly effective for those who wake up in the middle of the night, facilitating easy return to sleep. Additionally, it has a calming effect on anxiety, providing a steadier mood throughout the day.

## Considerations for Supplementation

- **Melatonin**: Although widely used, over-the-counter melatonin supplements often deliver dosages higher than those produced naturally within the body. Excessive doses can lead to disrupted sleep architecture and affect other hormonal systems. Therefore, the foundational sleep stack is recommended over high-dose melatonin for regular use.

- **Consultation with Physicians**: It is advised to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement regimen, particularly to accommodate individual health needs and conditions.

For detailed discussion and up-to-date research links, Andrew Huberman provides these supplements in his Neural Network Newsletter, free to access for those looking to optimize their sleep hygiene.

In the latest episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Andrew Huberman is joined by Ari Wallik, an expert in [[longterm_thinking_and_future_planning | long-term thinking]] and strategic foresight. Wallik provides a compelling framework for how individuals can cultivate a positive legacy that not only benefits their immediate environment but also contributes to the well-being of future generations. This article unpacks some of the strategies discussed in their conversation and explores the tools that can be implemented in our daily lives to build a positive legacy.

## Understanding Time Perception and Future Generations

One of the foundational aspects discussed is the concept of **mental time travel**. Humans possess the unique ability to project themselves into the future, considering possible outcomes and scenarios, an ability that forms the bedrock of planning for a long-term legacy. Wallik explains how this capability stems from our hippocampus, which allows us to forecast and plan based on past experiences without the restrictions of temporal awareness. This approach is crucial for setting long-term goals that align with creating a positive future.

He emphasizes the need to balance present actions with future planning to foster a culture of foresight and legacy-building. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>

## Strategies and Practices for a Positive Legacy

### 1. **Transgenerational Empathy**

Wallik introduces the concept of **transgenerational empathy**, a crucial tool for understanding and connecting with both past and future generations. It involves three levels:
- **Empathy for Self**: Recognizing that you are doing your best with the resources you have allows for self-compassion and improved decision-making.
- **Empathy for the Past**: Understanding the lives and struggles of previous generations helps inform better cultural and societal decisions.
- **Empathy for Future Generations**: Imagining the emotional states of future generations can guide current actions to ensure their prosperity and well-being. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>

### 2. **Futures Thinking**

**Futures thinking** involves using imagination to project multiple possible futures. This strategic foresight allows individuals and organizations to prepare for both best-case and worst-case scenarios, creating a roadmap that is resilient to unexpected changes.

### 3. **Creating Concrete Reminders**

Practices such as keeping a photograph of one's aged self on the mirror or writing letters to your future self can serve as practical reminders of the future. These exercises help align present actions with long-term goals, making future-oriented decision-making a more tangible process.

## The Role of Infrastructure and Institutions

Wallik stresses the importance of rebuilding trust in institutions like education and government, which serve as pillars for guiding collective futures. A collective approach to fostering environments that encourage long-term thinking and ethical decision-making is critical.

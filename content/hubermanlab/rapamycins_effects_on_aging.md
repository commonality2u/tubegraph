Rapamycin has quickly grown to be a focal point in discussions about longevity and aging. Originally known for its immunosuppressive properties, Rapamycin has gained significant attention for its potential geroprotective effects. Here, we explore the insights presented by Dr. Peter Attia and Dr. Andrew Huberman regarding Rapamycin and aging.

## What is Rapamycin?

Rapamycin is a drug that was first approved as an immunosuppressant to prevent organ transplant rejection. Its primary mechanism of action is the inhibition of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway, which has been shown to play a crucial role in cell growth, proliferation, and survival.

## Rapamycin and Lifespan Extension

Rapamycin is unique in the field of longevity research because it has shown consistent results in lifespan extension across several model organisms, from yeast to mammals. In conversations with Dr. Andrew Huberman, Dr. Peter Attia highlighted significant findings:

1. **Experimental Consistency:** Rapamycin, along with caloric restriction, is one of the only interventions that has been shown to extend lifespan across multiple species, including yeast, fruit flies, mice, and even some primates. This consistency makes it a standout candidate for human aging studies [[interventions_to_slow_and_reverse_aging | interventions to slow and reverse aging]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20">[20:20]</a>).

2. **Life Extension in Mice:** Initial studies with mice demonstrated that rapamycin extended their lifespan even when administered late in life. The first study, where the mice began receiving rapamycin at the equivalent of 60 human years, showed a notable extension in lifespan, thus supporting its efficacy even at advanced ages [[the_biology_of_aging | biology of aging]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00">[15:00]</a>).

3. **Awaiting Results in Higher Mammals:** Ongoing studies, such as those led by Matt Kaeberlein with companion dogs, are eagerly awaited to shed light on rapamycin's effects in higher mammals, possibly translating to human applications in the future. The results anticipated in 2026 could either reinforce or challenge current perspectives on rapamycin [[healthspan_and_longevity_strategies | healthspan and longevity strategies]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:54">[21:54]</a>).

## Mechanisms of Action

The primary target of rapamycin is the mTOR complex, which influences several cellular processes:

- **Inhibition of mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1):** This leads to a reduction in cell growth and proliferation rates, essentially slowing down aspects of the aging process.
- **Stimulation of Autophagy:** By inhibiting mTOR, rapamycin promotes autophagy, a process that removes damaged proteins and organelles, thereby maintaining cellular health [[understanding_the_energy_systems_for_endurance | understanding cellular energy systems]].

## Potential Side Effects and Current Usage

While rapamycin is promising, it is not without side effects. Dr. Attia mentioned experiencing aphthous ulcers—painful mouth sores—leading to a pattern of taking breaks from the drug every few months [[supplements_and_their_impact_on_aging | supplements and their impact on aging]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18">[18:18]</a>). This highlights the need for careful consideration and individualized assessment when contemplating rapamycin use for anti-aging purposes.

## Conclusion

Rapamycin's effects on aging are compelling due to its consistent performance in experimental settings. However, despite promising data, more research is needed to fully understand its implications for human longevity. Ongoing and future clinical studies are crucial to determine the potential for rapamycin to become a part of geroprotective therapeutic strategies. The scientific community remains vigilant, awaiting further data to solidify rapamycin's role in combating aging.

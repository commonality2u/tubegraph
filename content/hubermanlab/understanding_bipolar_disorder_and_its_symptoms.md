Bipolar disorder, often referred to as bipolar depression, is a complex mental health disorder characterized by significant shifts in mood, energy, and perception. These changes are typically maladaptive, leading to serious challenges for both the individuals afflicted and those around them. This article delves into the basic understanding of bipolar disorder, its symptoms, types, and implications for those affected.

## Overview of Bipolar Disorder

Bipolar disorder impacts approximately 1% of the global population. Despite seeming like a small percentage, in any given room of a hundred people, there is likely at least one individual suffering from this condition. It is crucial to understand that bipolar disorder is severe, with those diagnosed being 20 to 30 times more likely to attempt suicide compared to the general population<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

## Types of Bipolar Disorder

There are two primary types of bipolar disorder:

### Bipolar I Disorder

Bipolar I is characterized by pronounced manic episodes lasting at least seven days. These episodes involve elevated mood, increased activity, distractibility, impulsivity, and, in some cases, psychosis. Despite misconceptions, these manic episodes are not necessarily followed by depressive episodes<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>.

### Bipolar II Disorder

Bipolar II disorder involves episodes of hypomania, which are less intense than full mania, lasting approximately four days. Individuals with Bipolar II often experience significant drops into major depressive episodes following their high phases<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>.

## Common Symptoms

The symptoms of bipolar disorder are diverse, manifesting differently across individuals. Manic episodes may present with:

- **Distractibility:** A tendency to move quickly from one topic to another without focus<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>.
- **Impulsivity:** Engaging in unplanned activities such as random purchases or sudden decisions without consideration of the implications<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.
- **Sleep Deprivation:** Little to no desire or need for sleep, often continuing for days without experiencing fatigue<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.

## Impact and Risk

The burden of bipolar disorder is categorized under 'global burden,' factoring in the years lost engaging in normal life due to disability. It often ranks among the top 10 disabilities globally due to its profound effect on occupational and educational outcomes<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:43">[00:39:43]</a>.

## Genetic and Environmental Influences

With a heritability estimate of 85%, bipolar disorder has a strong genetic component, although environmental factors such as early life stress also play pivotal roles<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>.

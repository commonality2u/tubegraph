High conflict behaviors in relationships can significantly influence the dynamics and healthiness of interactions between individuals, and understanding these behaviors can help individuals manage and mitigate conflicts more effectively. In this article, we explore what constitutes high conflict behaviors as discussed in the Huberman Lab Podcast episode featuring Bill Eddy, an expert on conflict resolution and [[high_conflict_personalities | high conflict personalities]].

## Understanding High Conflict Personalities

High conflict personalities are individuals who frequently engage in behaviors that escalate conflicts rather than resolve them. According to Bill Eddy, these personalities fall outside of the usual personality disorder categories, such as narcissistic, borderline, or antisocial [[personality_disorders_and_misconceptions | personality disorders]], though there may be overlap. They often display a persistent pattern of blaming others and can have any combination of traits from these disorders or none at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### Types of High Conflict Behaviors

High conflict behaviors can manifest in two major ways: overtly combative or covertly manipulative. The overt type tends to argue and generate visible disputes, whereas the covert type may play the victim to garner sympathy and negative advocacy from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Impacts on Relationships

### Personal Relationships

In personal relationships, high conflict behaviors often result in significant stress and emotional turmoil for both parties. The combative type might engage in constant arguments, while the victim-playing type could manipulate the situation to gain sympathy, making genuine resolutions difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:24">[01:58:24]</a>. Bill Eddy notes that realigning focus towards understanding these behaviors rather than assigning blame can be crucial to dealing with the challenges they present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:54">[01:52:54]</a>.

### Professional Relationships

High conflict personalities in the workplace can decrease productivity and create a toxic environment. They may stir unnecessary disputes or manipulate coworkers into alliances that support their perspectives, disrupting team cohesion. Eddy suggests using strategies like the "CARs method" — Connecting, Analyzing, Responding, and Setting limits — to manage interactions with high conflict individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:58">[02:19:58]</a>.

## Strategies for Managing High Conflict Relationships

### Avoid Blaming

Avoid direct confrontations that place blame on a high conflict individual. Instead, keep discussions focused on behaviors and outcomes. This tactic helps prevent escalating defensive reactions while maintaining the focus on resolving the conflict at hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:08">[01:40:08]</a>.

### Enhance Emotional Intelligence

Developing greater [[emotional_intelligence_and_its_definition | emotional intelligence]] and awareness can assist in recognizing high conflict behaviors early, thereby managing personal reactions and interactions more effectively. Eddy emphasizes not focusing on the emotions of high conflict personalities but rather guiding interactions towards practical decision-making and solutions.

### Establish Clear Boundaries

Setting firm boundaries and consequences is critical when interacting with high conflict individuals. Bill Eddy highlights the importance of clearly communicating behavioral expectations and the consequences for not meeting those expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:02">[02:31:02]</a>.

In a recent episode of the Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman, a professor of [[neurobiology_and_ophthalmology | neurobiology and ophthalmology]] at Stanford School of Medicine, delves into the science of heat and heating. A significant portion of the discussion is dedicated to exploring the protocols and necessary precautions associated with deliberate heat exposure, such as using saunas, to optimize health and performance.

## Understanding Body Temperature

Dr. Huberman begins by explaining that our body has two distinct temperatures: the core temperature of our internal organs and nervous system, and the shell temperature of our skin. The core temperature is typically higher than the shell temperature<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. The brain constantly regulates these temperatures, sending signals to either warm up or cool down the body as necessary<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

## Sauna Health Benefits and Recommendations

The use of [[health_benefits_of_sauna | saunas]] has been associated with various health benefits, such as reduced cardiovascular mortality and improved overall longevity. According to studies, the frequency and duration of sauna use significantly impact these benefits. Using the sauna two to three times a week can reduce cardiovascular mortality risk by 27%, and using it four to seven times a week can reduce the risk by 50%<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>.

### Recommended Sauna Protocol

- **Temperature**: 80 to 100 degrees Celsius (176 to 212 degrees Fahrenheit)<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.
- **Duration**: 5 to 20 minutes per session, depending on individual heat tolerance<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>.

## Cautions and Safety

Deliberate heat exposure must be approached with caution due to the risk of hyperthermia, which can cause neuron damage. Dr. Huberman emphasizes that unlike [[benefits_of_deliberate_cold_exposure_for_mental_and_physical_health | cold exposure]], where a broad range of temperatures can be tolerated, the margin for safe heat exposure is narrower<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

> 
> - **Start Slow**: Begin with lower temperatures and shorter durations if you are new to sauna use.
> - **Hydration**: Ensure adequate hydration before and after sauna sessions to replenish lost fluids<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
> - **Medical Conditions**: Individuals with certain health conditions, such as pregnancy or sensitivity to heat, should consult a doctor before sauna use<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.
> - **Cooling Measures**: Utilize cooling techniques if needed, especially focusing on areas with glabrous skin to rapidly cool the core<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:30">[01:30:30]</a>.

## Additional Health Benefits

Regular sauna use can also lead to significant decreases in cortisol levels, providing a tool for [[stress_management_and_performance | stress management]]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>. Heat exposure enhances the expression of heat shock proteins, supporting cellular health and potentially [[healthspan_and_longevity_strategies | extending lifespan]]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>. Furthermore, endorphin pathways are activated, [[endorphins_and_mood_improvement_through_heat | improving mood and overall mental health]]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:21">[01:17:21]</a>.

In conclusion, while deliberate heat exposure through saunas and other methods offers numerous health benefits, it is essential to follow proper protocols and exercise caution to safely optimize these practices.

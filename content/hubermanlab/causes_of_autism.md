Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has perplexed scientists and the public alike with its varied presentation and complex understanding of causative factors. Renowned neuroscientist Dr. Karen Parker, along with Andrew Huberman, delved into the causes of autism, tackling both established understandings and ongoing mysteries surrounding this developmental disorder [[current_understanding_of_autism_spectrum_disorders | current understanding of autism spectrum disorders]].

## Rising Incidence of Autism

The incidence of autism has significantly increased in the last two decades. Statistically, autism now affects 1 in 36 children, compared to a previous figure of 1 in 44 just a couple of years prior. This increase poses the question of whether we are witnessing a rise in autism cases, or whether improved diagnostic capabilities are responsible for this upsurge. Dr. Parker notes that pediatricians now have tools that allow them to diagnose autism in children as young as two or three years old, compared to the previous norm of diagnosis at age nine or ten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

## Genetic Contributions

Autism is known to have a substantial genetic component, with current estimates suggesting that approximately 40-80% of autism cases can be attributed to genetics [[genetic_inheritance_and_epigenetics | genetic inheritance and epigenetics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. The disorder is considered polygenic, meaning multiple common genetic variants contribute to the risk. It is believed that a collection of these variants can influence the degree and presentation of ASD traits in an individual. As Dr. Parker explains, these genetic predispositions are additive, meaning the more such variants a person has, the more prominent the autistic traits may be [[neurobiological_underpinnings_of_autism_spectrum_disorder | neurobiological underpinnings of autism spectrum disorder]].

## Environmental Influences

Aside from genetic factors, there are several environmental risk factors for autism. These include advanced parental age, severe prematurity, and maternal illness during pregnancy, among others [[impact_of_environment_and_lifestyle_on_health_and_physiology | impact of environment and lifestyle on health and physiology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>. There has been considerable debate, sometimes mired in controversy, about other environmental influences such as ultrasounds and vaccines, but scientific consensus has largely debunked these as major factors [[vaccinerelated_inflammation_and_mitochondrial_function | vaccine-related inflammation and mitochondrial function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:52">[02:44:52]</a>.

## Hypotheses and Ongoing Research

One plausible scientific hypothesis suggests that autism, at a biological level, can be related to excitatory-inhibitory imbalances in the brain [[neuroscience_and_brain_function | neuroscience and brain function]]. Dr. Parker proposes that certain developmental trajectories in the brain, possibly influenced by genetic and environmental interactions, predispose individuals to ASD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:58">[02:01:58]</a>.

Recent advances in understanding have suggested that neuropeptides such as vasopressin and oxytocin—traditionally thought to play roles in social bonding—may also be involved in autism [[role_of_oxytocin_and_vasopressin_in_social_behavior | role of oxytocin and vasopressin in social behavior]]. Dr. Parker’s research indicates a correlation between cerebrospinal fluid levels of these neuropeptides and autism, offering a potential biomarker approach to understanding and diagnosing the disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:03">[01:57:03]</a>.

## Conclusion

While significant advances have been made, the full spectrum of causes of autism remains an active field of scientific inquiry. Genetic predispositions play a strong role, and specific environmental factors may contribute to the risk and expression of ASD. Ongoing research aims to untangle these complex interactions with the hope of developing targeted therapies that can aid those affected by autism [[innovative_treatments_for_autism | innovative treatments for autism]].

Mindsets, a core focus of Dr. Alia Crum's research, play a crucial role in shaping the way our physiology responds to various stimuli, such as food, stress, and exercise. This concept, discussed in depth in the Huberman Lab Podcast featuring Dr. Crum, highlights how what we believe can significantly influence our physical and mental health.

## What Are Mindsets?

Mindsets are defined as the beliefs and assumptions that we hold about different domains, which orient us toward particular expectations, explanations, and goals. These core beliefs affect not only our motivation and behaviors but also our physiological processes [[impact_of_mindsets_and_behavior_on_immune_health | and impact on immune health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

## The Milkshake Study: A Case Example

One pivotal study conducted by Dr. Crum involved participants consuming milkshakes labeled either as "indulgent" or "sensible," despite both milkshakes having identical nutritional content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. The results demonstrated that the participants' ghrelin levels, a hormone linked to hunger, dropped more significantly when they believed they were consuming the indulgent shake, illustrating that mindset can alter physiological responses independent of the actual caloric intake.

## Stress Mindset and Physical Performance

Dr. Crum's research further explores the impact of mindset on stress and its physiological manifestations. Viewing stress as enhancing rather than debilitating can alter cortisol responses and influence performance. For example, in studies with Navy SEAL candidates, those with a [[stress_is_enhancing_mindset | stress-is-enhancing mindset]] performed better and had better outcomes in training compared to those with a stress-is-debilitating mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

## Mindset in Medication and Treatment

Mindset also affects how individuals respond to treatments. In collaboration with Dr. Kari Nadeau, Dr. Crum's team reframed the perception of side effects for children undergoing peanut allergy treatments. By educating them that side effects were a sign of the treatment working, patients experienced fewer symptoms and improved outcomes, highlighting the [[placebo_effects_and_their_impact_on_biology_and_psychology | placebo effects in treatment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

## How to Cultivate Adaptive Mindsets

Adopting a mindset that perceives stress and challenges as opportunities for growth can [[enhancing_treatment_through_mindset | enhance well-being and performance]]. Dr. Crum recommends acknowledging stress, welcoming it as a signal of something you care about, and utilizing the stress response to achieve your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a>.

In conclusion, Dr. Crum's research illuminates the profound impact of mindsets on our physiological health. By understanding and shifting our mindsets, we can potentially harness our beliefs to effect positive changes in both body and mind. For further exploration of mindsets and their physiological impacts, Dr. Crum's studies are accessible through the Stanford Mind and Body Lab.

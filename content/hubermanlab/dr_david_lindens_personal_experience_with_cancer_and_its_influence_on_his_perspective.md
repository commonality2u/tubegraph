Dr. David Linden, a renowned professor of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, shares a deeply personal aspect of his life as he navigates his journey with heart cancer. His candid discussion on the Huberman Lab Podcast reveals how his diagnosis has profoundly influenced his outlook on life, his emotions, and his connection to others.

## Initial Diagnosis and Reaction

In the summer of 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Linden experienced severe shortness of breath which he initially mistook for COVID-related symptoms. After seeking medical advice, he was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and later discovered to have a mass pressing against his heart. Originally believed to be a benign condition, further examination revealed it to be a rare and aggressive cancer called synovial sarcoma, located in the heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. This rare diagnosis left Dr. Linden feeling both angry and incredulous, questioning the improbable nature of his illness: "Heart cancer? Who the hell gets heart cancer?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:38">[02:14:38]</a>.

## Coping with Prognosis

Initially given a prognosis of just 6 to 18 months to live, a time frame he has fortunately exceeded, Dr. Linden found himself grappling with intense feelings of anger and gratitude simultaneously. Despite the grim diagnosis, he describes experiencing profound gratitude for the life he has led, acknowledging the blessings of a fulfilling career, a loving family, and the joy of following his curiosity [[finding_ones_unique_purpose | following his curiosity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:39">[02:15:39]</a>. This dual existence of conflicting emotions—rage at the universe juxtaposed with appreciation for life's offerings—was a revelation to him, highlighting the complex nature of human emotional experience.

## Reflections on Mortality

Dr. Linden's diagnosis prompted deep reflection on mortality, not only as a biological inevitability but also as a personal journey, intertwining with the psychology of mortality and meaning [[the_psychology_of_mortality_and_meaning]]. Despite his scientific background, he found it challenging to truly engage with the reality of his mortality, observing that this might be a universal human difficulty. He speculates that the brain's constant drive to predict and prepare for the future inherently conflicts with the acknowledgment of one's end, which has historically led humanity to concoct narratives of an afterlife in various forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:19">[02:24:19]</a>.

## Finding Agency in Curiosity

Throughout his treatment and the accompanying discomfort, Dr. Linden found unexpected solace and a sense of agency in his innate curiosity, showcasing the role of agency and gratitude in mental health [[role_of_agency_and_gratitude_in_mental_health]]. By intellectually engaging with his medical condition, he maintained a semblance of control and empowerment in an otherwise passive situation, illustrating the unique resilience that can stem from one's inherent interests and professional training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:18">[02:17:18]</a>.

## Gratitude for the "Big Things"

While many might expect a terminal diagnosis to shift focus to life's minor delights, Dr. Linden finds his gratitude expanding towards the larger aspects of existence—love, career, and consciousness itself. This introspective appreciation underscores a deep-seated recognition of what truly constitutes a life well-lived, resonating with the science of gratitude and its health benefits [[science_of_gratitude_and_its_health_benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:36">[02:28:36]</a>.

Yet, his response to this criticism was not to step back but to push harder, driven by a desire to constantly improve and innovate in his craft [[the_importance_of_selfdiscipline_and_focus | importance of self-discipline and focus]].

## Breaking Boundaries

Hawk's dedication was not without risks.

Rather than accepting this as a career-ending injury, Hawk's indomitable spirit saw him return to attempt and land the very trick that took him down [[resilience_and_mental_toughness | resilience and mental toughness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

In a recent episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman sat down with Dr. Lane Norton, a leading expert in exercise and nutrition, to discuss several topics related to nutrition and supplementation, among which were the effects and controversies surrounding [[artificial_sweeteners_and_their_impact_on_weight_loss_and_health | artificial sweeteners]] and [[role_of_processed_foods_in_metabolic_disorders | seed oils]]. Below, we summarize Dr. Norton's insights into these topics, as discussed in the podcast.

## Artificial Sweeteners

When it comes to artificial sweeteners, there is often public concern regarding their safety and potential effects on metabolic health, [[the_effects_of_exercise_on_appetite_and_weight_loss | appetite]], and the [[gut_microbiome_and_its_impact_on_health | gut microbiome]]. Here’s a breakdown of the key points from Dr. Norton’s discussion:

### Metabolic Effects and Appetite Stimulation:
Dr. Norton explains that concerns about artificial sweeteners like aspartame and sucralose stimulating insulin secretion or increasing appetite are largely unfounded based on current data. He references meta-analyses that show artificial sweeteners do not significantly affect insulin levels or glycaemia (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:09">[03:23:09]</a>). Moreover, there is a misconception that these sweeteners [[addressing_anxiety_and_confidence | stimulate appetite]]; however, randomized controlled trials show that substituting sugar-sweetened drinks with diet drinks actually results in weight loss and better weight management (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:05">[03:25:05]</a>).

### Gut Microbiome:
The impact of artificial sweeteners on the gut microbiome is another area of concern. Dr. Norton mentions research indicating that [[impact_of_diet_on_gut_microbiome | different sweeteners]] may lead to changes in gut microbiota composition, but the clinical significance of these changes remains unclear (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:09">[03:31:09]</a>). Notably, sucralose and saccharin have shown some effects on the microbiome, yet these findings are not consistent across all studies.

## Seed Oils

Seed oils, such as canola, soybean, and sunflower oils, have been the subject of criticism, with some suggesting they are harmful and could contribute to [[role_of_inflammation_in_chronic_disease | inflammation]] and chronic diseases. Dr. Norton provides clarity on this issue:

### Nutritional Impact and Health Outcomes:
Dr. Norton emphasizes that much of the criticism aimed at seed oils is not adequately supported by high-quality scientific evidence. He argues that seed oils, similar to other [[the_role_of_omega3_fatty_acids | polyunsaturated fats]], do not demonstrate harmful effects when they replace saturated fats in the diet. In fact, studies show either a neutral or beneficial effect on inflammation and metabolic health when seed oils are substituted for saturated fats (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>).

### Contextual Factors:
Dr. Norton advises that when evaluating the health impacts of seed oils, [[impact_of_lifestyle_and_diet_on_mental_health | context is key]]. It is essential to compare the effects of seed oils to those of other fats in equivalent caloric amounts and dietary contexts. The significant influence on health outcomes often arises from overall [[nutrition_and_mental_health | dietary patterns]] rather than the isolated effects of seed oils themselves.

> [!info] Takeaway
> Dr. Lane Norton's evaluation of artificial sweeteners and seed oils underscores the importance of contextual understanding and comprehensive evaluation of scientific data. The concerns associated with these substances are often influenced by misconceptions and lack of high-quality evidence-based studies. Thus, both artificial sweeteners and seed oils, when used appropriately, can be part of a balanced diet without posing significant health risks.

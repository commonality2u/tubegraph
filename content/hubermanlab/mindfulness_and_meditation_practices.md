In a fascinating episode of the Huberman Lab podcast, Andrew Huberman interviews renowned music producer Rick Rubin, delving deep into the topic of mindfulness and meditation practices. Rubin's approach to creativity is profoundly intertwined with various mindfulness techniques that underscore his way of being.

## Meditation Techniques and Experiences

Rubin passionately discusses his long-term relationship with meditation, which began when he was just 14 years old with [[transcendental_meditation_and_brain_health | Transcendental Meditation (TM)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. He describes TM as a foundational element of his life, indicating that it has changed his way of being over the years.

He also practices a variation of meditation that might start with breathing exercises and can evolve into gratitude or meta practices — the latter involving repeated affirmations such as, "May I be filled with loving kindness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. Rubin emphasizes the importance of personal evolution within meditation, explaining that he transitioned into incorporating [[breathwork_in_meditation | breathing]] as a way to enhance his heart rate variability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

## The Role of Meditation in Creativity

Rubin posits that meditation helps artists channel their sensitivity into productive creativity. This sensitivity, while a double-edged sword, gives rise to great art but also leaves creatives vulnerable to overwhelming emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:59">[00:38:59]</a>. According to Rubin, meditation has been pivotal in fostering an internal balance and in providing a structure that supports his [[creative_process_and_creativity_across_domains | creative endeavors]].

## Implementing Mindfulness Daily

Mindfulness isn't confined solely to formal meditation practices for Rubin. His routine includes starting his day with sun exposure and calm [[impact_of_light_exposure_on_circadian_rhythms | stretching exercises]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:21">[01:50:21]</a>. He stresses the significance of dedicating the initial hours of the day to personal space, allowing thoughts to flow naturally before engaging in work-related activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

## Evening Rituals for Mindfulness

Rubin adapts his environment to sustain mindfulness during the evening. This includes limiting exposure to artificial light by wearing red glasses after sunset, creating an atmosphere conducive to winding down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:59">[01:52:59]</a>. He surrounds himself with family in the tranquility of a home bathed in red light, reinforcing the day’s [[evening_routine_and_health | peaceful culmination]].

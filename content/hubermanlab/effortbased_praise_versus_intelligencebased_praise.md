In a recent episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman delves into the concepts of effort-based praise versus intelligence-based praise, highlighting their profound effects on performance, motivation, and personal perception. This article aims to unpack these ideas, providing insights into why focusing on effort might be more beneficial than emphasizing innate intelligence.

## Understanding the Concepts

### Intelligence-Based Praise

Intelligence-based praise typically includes affirmations like "you're so smart" or "you have a natural talent for this." While such praise might seem encouraging on the surface, research highlighted by Dr. Carol Dweck and Dr. Claudia Mueller reveals that such feedback can undermine performance and motivation in the long run, particularly for those who perform well initially.

According to Huberman, tying our identity to being intelligent or talented can create pressure to maintain that label, potentially leading to a decline in performance when faced with challenges. This pressure can also result in individuals avoiding difficult tasks to prevent the risk of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Effort-Based Praise

Effort-based praise focuses on recognizing the hard work and perseverance someone puts into a task, such as "you worked really hard on this" or "your persistence paid off." Unlike intelligence-based praise, effort-based praise encourages individuals to embrace challenges and view setbacks as opportunities for growth.

Research cited by Huberman, particularly a 1998 study by Dweck and Mueller, highlights that students who receive effort-based praise are more likely to choose challenging tasks, persist longer, and perform better over time than those who receive intelligence-based praise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. This transformation aligns with the principles of the [[growth_mindset_and_its_importance | growth mindset]].

## The Evidence

The compelling study by Dweck and Mueller observed that children who received intelligence-based praise chose easier tasks to maintain their "smart" label, whereas those praised for their effort opted for more challenging ones. Furthermore, this study found that intelligence praise recipients often misrepresented their performance, highlighting the risk of fostering a fixed mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

In contrast, children who received effort-based praise exhibited increased motivation, resilience, and improved performance, illustrating how emphasizing effort over innate intelligence can cultivate a growth mindset that enhances learning and personal development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.

## Why Effort-Based Praise Matters

### Encourages Resilience

When praise is centered on effort, it reinforces the idea that persistence and hard work are valuable, empowering individuals to tackle difficulties with resilience. This mindset is crucial in educational and professional settings, where challenges are inevitable. Resilience is also essential in handling adversity and change, as explored in [[coping_with_change_and_adversity | coping with change]].

### Promotes a Growth Mindset

Effort-based praise aligns with the growth mindset theory, which posits that abilities and intelligence can be developed through dedication and hard work. This mindset fosters a love for learning and a resilience essential for great accomplishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. The concept of [[neuroplasticity_and_adaptive_learning | neuroplasticity]] also highlights how the brain can change in response to effortful learning.

### Reduces Fear of Failure

By focusing on effort rather than innate ability, individuals are less likely to fear failure. They see unsuccessful attempts as stepping stones to success rather than reflections of their worth or capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.

## Practical Implications

Educators, parents, and leaders should strive to employ effort-based praise in daily interactions. When observing achievements, highlighting the processes and dedication involved rather than inherent traits can have long-lasting positive effects on motivation and performance. For example, praising a student for their preparation and tenacity in tackling a difficult project encourages continued effort and learning.

In summary, pivoting from intelligence-based to effort-based praise can significantly influence personal and academic success. By fostering environments where effort is celebrated, we prepare individuals to face challenges with confidence and resilience, ready to grow and excel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. This approach not only supports personal development but also enhances strategies for [[navigating_personal_transformation_and_growth | navigating personal transformation]].

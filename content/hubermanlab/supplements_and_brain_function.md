In the podcast hosted by Andrew Huberman, a professor of [[neurobiology_and_ophthalmology | neurobiology and ophthalmology]] at Stanford School of Medicine, an extensive discussion focuses on the intricate relationships between nutrition, [[dietary_and_supplement_recommendations_for_mental_performance | supplements]], and brain function. In the context of brain health, certain nutrients and supplements stand out for their potential to support cognitive function both in the immediate and long-term perspectives.

## Essential Brain-Supporting Nutrients

### Omega-3 Fatty Acids
Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA, are essential for maintaining the structural integrity of neurons, the building blocks of our nervous system. Huberman highlights that while most people get enough omega-6s, omega-3s are often lacking in diets. The consumption of 1.5 to 3 grams of EPA per day can be beneficial for enhancing mood, offsetting depression [[biological_basis_of_depression_and_mood_disorders | depression]], and supporting cognitive function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.

> [!info] Sources of Omega-3
> Omega-3 fatty acids can be ingested through both animal-based sources like fish and plant-based sources such as chia seeds and walnuts. Supplementation via [[supplements_and_dietary_influences_on_brain_function | fish oil]] is also a viable option, especially for those who are not frequent fish eaters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.

### Phosphatidylserine
Phosphatidylserine is another lipid-like compound supportive of neuronal health. Available primarily in meats, fish, and cabbage, studies have shown that 300 mg of phosphatidylserine daily can help reduce cognitive decline and improve cognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.

### Choline
Choline is vital for the production of the neuromodulator acetylcholine, crucial for memory and focus. The primary food source for choline is eggs, especially egg yolks, but it is also found in certain meats and plant foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. Supplementation with alpha-GPC is another method to increase choline intake.

## Notable Supplements for Cognition

### Creatine
Creatine is recognized not only as a compound for muscle support but also for its role in cognitive enhancement. Regular supplementation of 5 grams per day can assist brain function, particularly in individuals who do not consume meat, which naturally contains creatine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>.

### Anthocyanins
Found in blueberries and other berries, anthocyanins have antioxidant properties that may reduce DNA damage and cognitive decline, making them a superfood for brain health [[gut_microbiome_and_brain_health | brain health]]. Consuming about 60 to 120 grams of fresh blueberries daily can yield these benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:08">[00:41:08]</a>.

### Glutamine
Glutamine, abundant in both animal and plant sources, is an amino acid that can support immune and cognitive function. Supplementation can range from 1 to 10 grams per day, and it can also aid in [[mechanisms_of_sugar_cravings | reducing sugar cravings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:52">[00:44:52]</a>.

## The Role of Supplements in Brain Health

Overall, the integration of these nutrients and supplements into one's diet can significantly enhance neuronal function and overall brain health. Huberman emphasizes that while supplements like fish oil and creatine provide convenient ways to reach optimal nutrient levels, obtaining these nutrients from whole foods is also effective.

Supplements provide a feasible strategy to ensure regular intake of key nutrients that may be insufficient in a typical diet. However, before incorporating supplements into oneâ€™s routine, consulting with healthcare professionals is advised to tailor the approach to individual health needs and conditions.

This exploration of [[nutrition_and_dietary_supplements | supplements]] and brain function underscores the idea that informed dietary choices, complemented by well-chosen supplements, can maintain and enhance cognitive health across the lifespan.

Saunas have been a staple of relaxation and wellness routines for centuries, but recent research is shedding light on their profound impact on health. Andrew Huberman, a professor of [[neurobiology_and_ophthalmology | neurobiology and ophthalmology]] at Stanford School of Medicine, delves into the mechanisms and benefits of sauna use in a recent episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast. Below, we explore these benefits, drawing from his discussion and various scientific studies.

## Cardiovascular Health and Longevity

Regular sauna use is associated with significant improvements in cardiovascular health. A 2018 study demonstrated that sauna bathing could reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality. Participants who engaged in sauna sessions two to three times per week were 27% less likely to die from cardiovascular events compared to those who used it once weekly. This risk reduction climbed to 50% for those frequenting the sauna four to seven times weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.

## Hormonal Benefits

Sauna exposure has been shown to modulate hormone levels beneficially. For instance, regular sauna use can decrease cortisol levels, a stress hormone, thus potentially reducing stress and its harmful effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>. Additionally, sauna protocols can significantly increase growth hormone levels, up to 16-fold in some instances, which can aid in tissue repair and growth [[growth_hormonestimulating_peptides | hormone increase, more sporadic usage is beneficial]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a>.

## Mental Health Improvements

Sauna bathing also supports mental health. It enhances mood by activating the [[role_of_emotions_and_the_nervous_system | endorphin system]], specifically through the modulation of dynorphin, a molecule associated with discomfort. Over time, this process enhances the brain's capacity to experience pleasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:58">[01:24:58]</a>. Moreover, frequent sauna use has been correlated with a reduced risk of developing psychotic disorders [[impact_of_lifestyle_and_diet_on_mental_health | mental health benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:46">[01:25:46]</a>.

## Metabolic and Immune Function

Sauna heat exposure activates heat shock proteins, which play a critical role in protein repair and cellular health [[mechanisms_of_heat_exposure_and_body_heating | heat exposure activates heat shock proteins]]. This response helps mitigate damage caused by misfolded proteins, thus enhancing immune function and potentially extending lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>. Moreover, sauna usage may promote the conversion of white fat to beige fat, increasing overall metabolism and energy expenditure [[the_role_of_mitochondria_in_energy_production_and_metabolic_dysfunction | metabolism enhancement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:07">[01:36:07]</a>.

## Optimal Protocols and Considerations

For cardiovascular and longevity benefits, it is advisable to engage in sauna sessions three to seven times per week, at temperatures between 80 to 100 degrees Celsius (176 to 212 degrees Fahrenheit) for sessions lasting 5 to 20 minutes each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>. For hormonal benefits, especially growth hormone increase, more sporadic usage is beneficial.

It's crucial to ensure that sauna use is safe and tailored to individual health conditions. Hyperthermia can be dangerous, and caution should be exercised, especially by individuals who are pregnant, nursing, or sensitive to heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

In conclusion, saunas are more than just a luxury; they are a potent tool for enhancing both physical and mental health. The science outlined by Huberman indicates that with correct usage, sauna bathing can significantly contribute to a healthier life.

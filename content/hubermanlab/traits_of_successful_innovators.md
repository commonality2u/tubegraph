## Traits of Successful Innovators

In a recent episode of the Huberman Lab podcast, Andrew Huberman sat down with Marc Andreessen to delve into the intricate world of innovation, exploring the key traits that set great innovators apart from the rest. This conversation shed light on the psychological and environmental components that contribute to the making of an exceptional innovator and offered insights into how these traits can be nurtured and leveraged. Let's explore these traits as discussed by Marc Andreessen.

### Key Traits of Innovators

Marc Andreessen, a notable tech investor and innovator himself, outlined a set of traits that are frequently observed in highly successful innovators. These traits, which align with the Big Five personality traits, are crucial in determining an individual's capability to innovate effectively.

#### 1. Openness to Experience

One of the most significant traits is a high level of **openness to experience**. This involves a profound curiosity and willingness to engage with new ideas. Innovators are naturally inclined to explore a wide array of concepts and are not limited to a single domain. Andreessen noted that many innovators exhibit creativity not just in their professional pursuits but also in their personal lives, embracing artistic and diverse experiences ([[creative_process_and_artistic_inspiration | creative process and artistic inspiration]]) (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>).

#### 2. Conscientiousness

However, openness alone is insufficient. Complementing this trait is **conscientiousness**, which represents the diligence and consistency necessary to drive a project or idea through to completion. Innovators who are high in conscientiousness possess an ability to focus meticulously and work persistently over long periods, often over many years, to bring their ideas to fruition [[the_importance_of_selfdiscipline_and_focus | the importance of self-discipline and focus]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>).

#### 3. Disagreeableness

Another critical trait identified is **disagreeableness**. While this might sound negative, it reflects a personâ€™s ability to withstand external pressure and criticism. Disagreeable individuals are often willing to challenge the status quo and push through criticism, which is essential when pioneering new ideas that might initially face resistance or skepticism from the broader community [[challenges_and_opposition_faced_by_innovators | challenges and opposition faced by innovators]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>).

#### 4. High Intelligence 

Innovators typically show high levels of **intelligence** or IQ, which is necessary for synthesizing complex information and solving intricate problems. This intellectual capability allows them to understand and visualize pathways that others may not perceive [[concept_of_intelligence_and_learning | concept of intelligence and learning]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>).

#### 5. Low Levels of Neuroticism

Lastly, successful innovators often exhibit relatively **low levels of neuroticism**. This trait allows them to handle stress and failures more effectively, maintaining their focus and drive even in challenging circumstances [[the_impact_of_stress_on_eating_and_metabolism | the impact of stress on eating and metabolism]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>).

### Born or Made?

Marc Andreessen discussed whether these traits are innate or developed, suggesting that while genetic predispositions play a role ([[genetic_inheritance_and_epigenetics | genetic inheritance and epigenetics]]), the decision to pursue innovation and how an individual navigates their environment significantly impacts their success. Innovators emerge from a combination of inherent traits and their choices, along with environmental influences like culture and upbringing [[impact_of_environment_and_lifestyle_on_health_and_physiology | impact of environment and lifestyle on health and physiology]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>).

### Conclusion

Understanding these traits helps to illuminate why certain individuals are capable of transforming industries and initiating profound change. As Andreessen highlighted, these innovators are rare and often swim upstream against societal norms. But with the right mix of traits and support, they are able to implement ideas that ultimately reshape the world.

By aligning potential innovators with environments that support their unique traits, society can better harness these individuals' transformative power, leading to advancements across various fields. For aspiring innovators, developing these traits and cultivating an environment that nurtures them could be key steps toward achieving breakthroughs.

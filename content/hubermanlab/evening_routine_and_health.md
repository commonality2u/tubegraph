The importance of having a structured evening routine cannot be understated, especially when it comes to our health and overall well-being. Andrew Huberman, a professor of [[neurobiology_and_ophthalmology | neurobiology and ophthalmology]] at Stanford School of Medicine, shares several insights on how we can optimize our evening habits to support better health outcomes.

## Significance of Evening Light Exposure

It's crucial to understand that light exposure in the evening can significantly impact our sleep quality. Huberman emphasizes the importance of getting a bit of natural sunlight in your eyes before the sun sets. This practice adjusts the sensitivity of neurons in your retina and in your brain, helping protect you against the effects of artificial light exposure later in the evening (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>).

> Viewing afternoon or evening sunlight can offset melatonin reduction caused by exposure to artificial lights by about 50% if viewed in the late afternoon or evening.

## Benefits of Red Lighting

Incorporating red lights into your evening routine can be highly beneficial. Red lights are known for their calming effects and their ability to lower cortisol levels compared to standard fluorescent or LED lighting. Applying red light in certain areas of your home, such as the bedroom, can create a soothing environment conducive to sleep. 

Huberman suggests using dimmable red lights to reduce blue wavelength exposure and assist the natural wind-down of the body's alertness systems in the evening. Furthermore, he mentions that red lighting appears to make individuals feel sleepier, which could facilitate a smoother transition to bedtime (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>).

## Evening Routine Tips

### Dimming the Lights

Dimming house lighting as much as possible without compromising safety is a simple yet effective tool. Setting lights low in the room can decrease exposure to stimulating wavelengths that might interfere with melatonin production (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>).

### Screen Time Management

For those who need to use screens in the evening, it is advisable to employ functions that eliminate blue light. Huberman shares a method for iPhone users involving the accessibility settings, allowing users to toggle a red-light filter on and off with a triple click (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>).

### Addressing Sleep Interruptions

If you find yourself waking up in the middle of the night, several strategies can help. Huberman suggests techniques such as long exhale breathing, using hypnosis apps like Reveri for self-directed relaxation [[role_of_hypnosis_in_pain_management | hypnosis for stress, anxiety, and pain management]], and being cautious about fluid intake before bed to lessen the chance of waking up due to discomfort from a full bladder (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>).

## Conclusion

Having an evening routine that incorporates exposure to natural light, the use of calming red lighting, and proper screen management can significantly enhance sleep quality [[importance_of_sleep_in_recovery_and_performance_enhancement | sleep quality and performance enhancement]] and overall health. By understanding and implementing these science-based strategies, your evenings can become a cornerstone for better health outcomes and improved daily performance.

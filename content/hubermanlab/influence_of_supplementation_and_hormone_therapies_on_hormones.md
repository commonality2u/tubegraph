In the latest episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman hosts Dr. Kyle Gillett to discuss various aspects of hormone health, with a focus on how supplementation and hormone therapies can influence hormonal balance and optimization. Dr. Gillett is an expert in family and obesity medicine and brings a wealth of knowledge about hormone therapy and supplementation.

## Hormone Optimization via Supplementation and Hormone Therapies

Dr. Gillett elaborates on several methodologies for optimizing hormone levels. The discussion centers around various approaches, including lifestyle modifications, supplements, and hormone replacement therapies (HRT).

### Behavior and Lifestyle Interventions

A pivotal element of hormone optimization is setting a strong foundation involving behavior and lifestyle interventions. Dr. Gillett highlights the importance of maintaining a balanced approach through what he refers to as the "big six pillars":
- Diet
- Exercise
- Stress optimization
- Sleep
- Sunlight
- Spiritual health

These pillars form the basis for any further supplementation or therapeutic interventions for hormone optimization, emphasizing that lifestyle choices are foundational and supplements act to support these practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

### Supplements for Hormone Optimization

Dr. Gillett discusses a variety of supplements known to impact hormone levels:

- **Curcumin & Black Pepper Extract**: Known to inhibit 5-alpha-reductase, potentially affecting DHT levels. Used for their anti-inflammatory properties but can lower DHT in men who might not favorably experience this effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:43">[00:46:43]</a>.

- **Creatine**: Mentioned as beneficial for both muscle and cognitive health, and notably increases DHT, which could be advantageous for some [[nutritional_and_supplemental_support_for_muscular_performance | supplements and nutrition for muscle performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>.

- **Inositol**: Particularly effective for women with PCOS, acting as an insulin sensitizer, and in some forms, an anti-androgen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:06">[01:02:06]</a>.

- **Boron**: Known to lower SHBG and potentially positively affect testosterone levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:52">[01:57:52]</a>.

- **Tongkat Ali**: Noted for potentially reducing SHBG, therefore freeing testosterone. It's also considered for enhancing libido and vitality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:50">[01:47:50]</a>.

- **Fadogia Agrestis**: Discussed in relation to increasing luteinizing hormone, which may boost testosterone production naturally [[testosterone_and_its_effects_on_human_and_animal_behavior | testosterone and its effects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:28">[01:52:28]</a>.

### Hormone Replacement Therapy

Hormone replacement therapies like testosterone replacement are becoming increasingly popular even amongst those not necessarily hypogonadal. Dr. Gillett points out a shift from large, infrequent doses to smaller, frequent doses to avoid peaks and troughs that can disrupt physiological balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:18">[01:31:18]</a>.

In discussing testosterone therapy, Dr. Gillett emphasizes that it's essential to monitor individual responses and adjust therapies accordingly. HRT is not without risks, such as increased potential for sleep apnea and cardiovascular issues, particularly if not managed properly with attention to factors like estrogen levels [[hormone_optimization_and_health_optimization | hormone optimization and optimization approaches]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>.

### Peptides and Other Therapeutics

Peptides like BPC-157 and melanotan were also discussed for specific therapeutic applications. The regulation of peptides can offer healing properties and are turning heads for their potential in both health optimization and athletic improvements [[overview_of_peptide_therapeutics | peptide therapeutics overview]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:06">[02:36:06]</a>.

> It's crucial to obtain peptides and hormone therapies through trusted medical professionals to ensure the safety and efficacy of these treatments.

### Conclusion

Dr. Gillett's approach provides a comprehensive view of the impact of supplementation and hormone therapies on hormones. These interventions, while beneficial, require careful consideration and monitoring by healthcare professionals. The podcast underscores the importance of foundational lifestyle choices as prerequisites for any supplementary or therapeutic measures, ensuring these treatments enhance rather than disrupt hormonal health.

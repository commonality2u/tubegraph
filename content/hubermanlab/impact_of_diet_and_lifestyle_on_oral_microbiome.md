Recent discussions in the field of dentistry have highlighted the significant influence of diet and lifestyle on [[influence_of_diet_and_lifestyle_on_oral_health | oral microbiome]], emphasizing its effect not only on oral health but also on overall systemic health. Dr. Stacy Whitman, a functional dentist, shares insights on how everyday choices can affect our oral ecosystem during an episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast.

## Understanding the Oral Microbiome

The oral microbiome is a complex community of bacteria, fungi, and viruses residing in the mouth. Maintaining this delicate balance is crucial, as a disrupted microbiome can lead to oral diseases and larger [[effects_of_oral_health_on_overall_health | health issues]]. Dr. Whitman explains that the traditional approach of using strong oral hygiene products often exacerbates these imbalances:

> We have been taught that we need to "carpet bomb" the mouth but unfortunately, many of these products damage our delicate microbiome, making things far worse. (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>)

## The Role of Diet

Dr. Whitman emphasizes that dietary choices significantly impact oral health:

- **Processed Foods**: Many modern processed foods contain added sugars and fermentable carbohydrates that feed harmful bacteria, causing cavities. Foods like crackers, chips, and granola bars, which are sticky and contain sugars, are particularly harmful [[impact_of_sugar_on_health | (impact of sugar on health)]]. (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>)

- **Whole Foods**: Conversely, a diet rich in whole, nutrient-dense foods supports a healthy oral microbiome. High-quality protein, a variety of vegetables, and whole grains are recommended to support oral and systemic health [[role_of_diet_and_fermented_foods_in_supporting_gut_health | (role of diet and fermented foods in supporting gut health)]]. (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>)

## Lifestyle Factors

In addition to diet, several lifestyle factors are crucial in maintaining a balanced oral microbiome:

- **Breathing Patterns**: Dr. Whitman highlights the importance of nasal breathing [[nasal_breathing_and_its_relation_to_oral_and_systemic_health | over mouth breathing]], which can dry the mouth and negatively influence the oral microbiome. Nasal breathing ensures better oxygenation and supports the production of nitric oxide, which is beneficial for cardiovascular health as well [[endurance_training_and_cardiovascular_health | (endurance training and cardiovascular health)]]. (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>)

- **Hydration**: Good hydration supports healthy saliva production, which is essential for remineralizing teeth and maintaining the oral environment. [[hydration_and_its_impact_on_health | Dehydration can lead to thick, mucousy saliva]] which is not beneficial for oral health. (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:50">[01:47:50]</a>)

- **Intermittent Fasting**: Implementing eating windows can prevent the mouth from constantly being in an acidic state, allowing time for the natural repair processes to remineralize teeth [[intermittent_fastings_effect_on_hormones_and_weight_loss | (intermittent fasting's effect on hormones and weight loss)]]. (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>)

## Conclusion

The connection between oral health and overall systemic health is becoming increasingly clear. By focusing on diet and lifestyle, individuals can not only improve oral health but potentially mitigate risks for broader health issues such as [[role_of_sleep_and_light_on_circadian_rhythms | cardiovascular diseases and cognitive decline]]. Dr. Whitman encourages a less is more approach, focusing more on dietary and lifestyle interventions rather than heavy reliance on products.

For more information on improving oral microbiome health, consider exploring advances like hydroxyapatite toothpaste, which mirrors the natural mineral composition of enamel, thus offering an effective alternative to fluoride toothpastes [[fluoride_and_other_elements_related_to_toothpaste_choices | (fluoride and other elements related to toothpaste choices)]].

In a recent episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman and Dr. Richard Schwarz delved deeply into the psychological and therapeutic aspects of trauma, particularly through the lens of [[internal_family_systems_ifs_therapy | Internal Family Systems (IFS) therapy]]. This exploration revealed significant insights into how trauma impacts psychological wellbeing and how it can be addressed.

## Understanding Trauma

Dr. Schwarz begins by distinguishing between events that are traumatic and those that are traumatizing. He explains that not every bad event becomes a trauma; it is not necessarily the event itself, but how it is processed internally and integrated (or not) that defines it as trauma. Trauma often manifests when vulnerable parts of an individual's psyche are hurt or feel worthless during an event and are subsequently exiled or locked away. These “exiles” remain frozen in time, perpetually living through the trauma, leading to protective behaviors or feelings in the individual that can interfere with their daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Impact on Personality and Self-Perception

Through IFS, Dr. Schwarz emphasizes that our minds are composed of various "parts" or subpersonalities that each have roles within our personality. Trauma affects these parts by forcing them into extreme roles to manage the vulnerability and pain created by the trauma. This often results in a pattern where some parts are fixated on protection, while others may be exiled, thus impacting [[personal_development_and_selfidentity | self-perception and personal development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## Protective Mechanisms and Vulnerability

IFS identifies two main types of protectors—the managers and the firefighters. Managers work to control life's circumstances to prevent any resurgence of trauma, while firefighters react impulsively to douse the flames of emotion when those protective strategies fail. Both are direct responses to the presence of exiled parts created by trauma; their primary mission is to shield the individual from re-experiencing the pain of their trauma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

## Trauma, Memory, and Time

A particularly intriguing aspect of trauma discussed by Dr. Schwarz is the role of [[neuroscience_of_perception_and_time | time perception in trauma]]. He notes that trauma locks parts of our emotional being in the past, causing individuals to react to present situations as if they are still enduring past traumas. The challenge, therefore, is unlocking these parts and bringing them into the present where they can be healed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

## Healing and Transformation

IFS therapy aims to transform these parts, not by suppressing them but by understanding and recontextualizing them. The goal is to connect with these parts in a compassionate and curious manner to understand what they protect and why. By doing so, individuals can [[achieving_personal_transformation_and_healing | unburden these parts]] of past traumas and integrate them, leading to a more coherent and resilient self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:03">[01:17:03]</a>.

## Conclusion

The discussion between Dr. Huberman and Dr. Schwarz sheds light on the nuanced role of trauma in psychological well-being. Through understanding the complex interplay of our internal parts, IFS offers a framework for healing and personal growth, highlighting the importance of approaching our inner experiences with compassion and curiosity. Such an approach not only aids in overcoming trauma but cultivates a more profound connection with oneself and others.

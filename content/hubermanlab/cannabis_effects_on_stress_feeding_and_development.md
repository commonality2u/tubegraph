title: Cannabis Effects on Stress, Feeding, and Development

---

## Introduction
Cannabis, a complex plant utilized for its medicinal and recreational properties, has generated significant interest from both scientific and public sectors. One area of focus is its influence on stress, feeding behavior, and developmental stages. Dr. Matthew Hill, a professor of Cell Biology and Anatomy at the University of Calgary, has centered much of his research around these impacts. This article distills key insights from a detailed discussion with Dr. Hill on these subjects.

## Cannabis and Stress

### The Role of Endocannabinoids
Cannabis primarily influences the brain and body through the endocannabinoid system [[effects_of_cannabis_on_the_brain_and_body | effects of cannabis on the brain and body]], which plays a crucial role in regulating stress responses. The primary psychoactive component of cannabis, THC (Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol), acts on cannabinoid receptors, predominantly the CB1 receptor, which is widely distributed throughout the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

### Stress Modulation
Endocannabinoids like anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2AG) modulate stress by maintaining homeostasis within neural circuits. Dr. Hill indicates that stress exposure leads to a decrease in anandamide signaling, which is intricately linked with anxiety states and can facilitate synaptic changes associated with stress responses [[alcohols_impact_on_stress_and_mood | alcohol's impact on stress and mood]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:33">[03:34:33]</a>.

### Cannabis as a Stress Reducer
Many users report cannabis as a tool to alleviate stress and anxiety [[science_based_tools_for_managing_stress | science-based tools for managing stress]], likely due to THC's role in modulating brain circuits involved in threat responses, notably in the amygdala [[role_of_amygdala_in_fear_response | role of amygdala in fear response]]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:53">[02:41:53]</a>. However, dosage is critical as higher doses may conversely lead to increased anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:16">[02:14:16]</a>.

## Cannabis and Feeding

### Appetite Stimulation
Cannabis is famously associated with stimulating appetite, a phenomenon colloquially known as "the munchies." THC influences feeding behavior through interactions with hypothalamic circuits and reward systems in the brain. It may mimic the neurochemical changes that occur during fasting, artificially inducing feeding behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>.

### Cannabinoid Interaction in Feeding Behavior
Cannabinoid receptors are involved in modulating the sensory experiences of food, enhancing the pleasure derived from eating, particularly sweet foods [[mechanisms_behind_food_preferences | mechanisms behind food preferences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. Studies have shown that THC can make palatable foods more rewarding and can override satiety signals, leading individuals to consume more even when they are not hungry [[role_of_dopamine_in_food_cravings_and_consumption | role of dopamine in food cravings and consumption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>.

## Cannabis and Development

### Impact on Adolescents
The developmental impact of cannabis, especially during adolescence, is a contentious topic. Adolescents are more susceptible to the effects of cannabis due to the ongoing development of the endocannabinoid system and its role in brain maturation [[sensitive_periods_for_neurodevelopment_especially_during_puberty | sensitive periods for neurodevelopment, especially during puberty]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:10">[02:26:10]</a>.

### Developmental Concerns
Regular cannabis use during developmental stages is associated with potential delays and alterations in cognitive development. There is ongoing debate about the long-term implications, particularly concerning cognitive and psychological development [[impact_of_cannabis_on_brain_health_and_cognition | cannabis influence on creativity and cognition]], although definitive causal relationships remain under investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:06">[02:45:06]</a>.

## Conclusion
Cannabis's impact on stress, feeding, and development illustrates the complexity of its interaction with the human body. While it holds potential benefits for stress reduction and appetite stimulation, particularly for medical conditions like cancer treatment side effects [[health_effects_and_risks_of_cannabis | health effects and risks of cannabis]], its role during adolescence and developmental periods requires cautious consideration. Future research, like that conducted by Dr. Hill, continues to shed light on these nuanced effects, guiding both medical application and public health policies.

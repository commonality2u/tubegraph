In a recent discussion between Andrew Huberman and Dr. Maya Shankar on the Huberman Lab podcast, the focus was cast on effective goal setting and strategies to bolster motivation. Dr. Shankar, a cognitive scientist, provided insights into how subtle changes in framing our goals can significantly affect our motivation and success in achieving them.

## Framing Goals: Approach vs. Avoidance

Dr. Shankar explained that the way we frame our goals can greatly affect our motivation levels and emotional responses to success or failure. She differentiates between **approach-oriented goals** and **avoidance-oriented goals**:

- **Approach-Oriented Goals**: These are goals framed in terms of what we want to achieve or gain, such as wanting to eat healthier foods. Success in approach goals is usually associated with feelings of pride and accomplishment, which can boost motivation and perseverance.
  
- **Avoidance-Oriented Goals**: These are framed around what we want to avoid, like avoiding unhealthy foods. The completion of avoidance goals typically results in feelings of relief. However, these goals can be harder to track and may not be as motivating over the long term.

Dr. Shankar recommends framing goals in an approach-oriented manner to enhance motivation and ensure clear markers of progress [[effective_goal_setting_techniques | Techniques for setting effective goals]] [00:40:55].

## Agency in Goal Setting

Another critical factor in maintaining motivation is **who sets the goal**. Dr. Shankar pointed out that when we take ownership of our goals rather than having them set by others, we preserve our sense of agency and control, which is a powerful motivator. This concept of personal agency can be leveraged by allowing choice and involvement in the goal-setting process, even if guided by mentors or coaches [[role_of_agency_and_gratitude_in_mental_health | Role of agency in mental health]] [01:48:01].

## Overcoming the Middle Problem

A common issue with goal achievement is the **middle problem**, where motivation dips midway through pursuing a goal. Dr. Shankar suggests breaking down larger goals into shorter, more manageable time frames to minimize prolonged periods of lower motivation. For instance, instead of setting a yearly resolution, set weekly or monthly objectives to create more frequent opportunities for a reset and renewed motivation [[motivation_strategies_for_achieving_goals | Motivation strategies for achieving goals]] [02:21:03].

## Leveraging Fresh Starts

Aligning new goals with significant life milestones, such as starting a new job or moving, can exploit the **fresh start effect**. These moments naturally segment our lives, providing a psychological clean slate that increases the likelihood of adopting new habits. Even arbitrary times, like the start of the week or month, can serve as effective fresh start moments [[the_biology_of_habit_formation | Biology of habit formation]] [02:17:33].

## Integration of Temptation Bundling

To combat aversion and enhance motivation, Dr. Shankar mentioned the concept of **temptation bundling**. This strategy involves pairing a less desirable task (e.g., exercising) with an enjoyable activity (e.g., listening to your favorite podcast) that you would otherwise forgo in lieu of something more indulgent. This makes the task more appealing and can lead to greater consistency in behavior [[role_of_dopamine_in_motivation_and_goal_pursuit | Role of dopamine in motivation and goal pursuit]] [02:22:07].

## Conclusion

Dr. Shankar's insights highlight the power of subtle changes in goal framing and the importance of personal agency in maintaining motivation. By strategically leveraging approach orientations, breaking down goals, tapping into fresh starts, and utilizing temptation bundling, individuals can sustain motivation and achieve their aspirations more effectively.

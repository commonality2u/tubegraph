In the latest episode of the Huberman Lab podcast, Andrew Huberman, a professor of [[neurobiology_and_ophthalmology | neurobiology and ophthalmology]] at Stanford School of Medicine, dives into the fascinating topic of time perception and its [[the_neuroscience_of_perception_and_time | neurochemical underpinnings]]. One key area of focus is how neuromodulators such as dopamine and serotonin affect our perception of time. Understanding these effects can offer profound insights into how we experience the world every day [00:00:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">00:00:14</a>).

## Dopamine: The Fine-Slicer of Time

Dopamine is a well-known neuromodulator associated with motivation, pursuit, and reward. However, it also plays a critical role in how we perceive the passage of time. Huberman explains that increased levels of dopamine lead us to overestimate the amount of time that has passed. In experiments, when subjects were given substances that elevate dopamine levels, they often reported that a minute had passed when in reality only about 38 seconds had elapsed [00:34:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">00:34:46</a>).

> As dopamine rises, it increases the frame rate of our time perception, similar to increasing the frames per second in a video. This fine-slicing makes experiences appear to occur at a slower pace [[understanding_dopamines_role_in_motivation_and_satisfaction | understanding dopamine's role in motivation and satisfaction]] [00:36:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">00:36:14</a>).

## Serotonin: The Broad Batcher

In contrast to dopamine, serotonin, another crucial neuromodulator, tends to slow down our perception of time. When serotonin levels are elevated, people often underestimate the passage of time. For instance, in studies with increased serotonin, subjects might allow six minutes to pass but perceive it as only five minutes [00:37:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">00:37:47</a>).

> Serotonin reduces the frame rate at which we perceive events, effectively broad batching time. This mechanism makes activities seem less detailed and more continuous [[the_role_of_dopamine_and_serotonin_in_depression | role of dopamine and serotonin in depression]] [00:39:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">00:39:14</a>).

## Circadian Variations

Huberman emphasizes that our natural [[circadian_and_ultradian_rhythms | circadian rhythms]] also influence these neurochemical levels, which in turn affects time perception throughout the day. Generally, dopamine and norepinephrine are higher in the morning, enhancing our ability to fine-slice time for detail-oriented, precise tasks. Conversely, in the evening, serotonin levels rise, favoring creative and broader thinking tasks [00:39:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">00:39:19</a>).

## Practical Applications

This understanding has practical implications. By aligning tasks requiring precision with the earlier part of the day when dopamine is naturally higher, and reserving creative tasks for later when serotonin dominates, one can optimize performance according to natural neurochemical oscillations [[impact_of_sleep_on_learning_and_memory | impact of sleep on learning and memory]] [00:40:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">00:40:46</a>).

## Conclusion

The interplay between dopamine and serotonin significantly shapes our perception of time, influencing how we experience day-to-day activities. By harnessing this knowledge, we can strategically plan our activities to align with these natural neurochemical cycles, thereby enhancing productivity and time management effectively [00:44:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">00:44:17</a>). For more insights, including the role of novelty and environmental factors on time perception, Andrew Huberman suggests exploring further neurobiological studies [[neuroplasticity_and_memory_formation | neuroplasticity and memory formation]].

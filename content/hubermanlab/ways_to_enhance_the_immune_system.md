In a recent episode of the Huberman Lab podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman and his guest, Dr. Roger Schwell, a board-certified pulmonologist and sleep medicine expert, discussed various strategies for enhancing immune function. The conversation outlined several natural and scientifically-backed methods to bolster the immune system, which can help in preventing infections and aiding faster recovery. Here are the key takeaways.

## The "New Start" Protocol

Dr. Schwell introduced the acronym **"New Start"** as a framework for bolstering overall health, including immune health. Each letter in "New Start" represents a pillar of health improvement:

### Nutrition
- Consuming a diet rich in natural, unprocessed foods supports immune health [[nutrition_and_supplementation_for_health | Nutrition and Supplementation for Health]].
- Avoid processed foods whenever possible [[role_of_processed_foods_in_metabolic_disorders | Role of Processed Foods in Metabolic Disorders]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>].

### Exercise
- Moderate exercise reduces inflammation and enhances immune function [[exercise_physiology_and_health_benefits | Exercise Physiology and Health Benefits]].
- However, over-exercising can suppress immunity [[impact_of_stress_on_eating_and_metabolism | Impact of Stress on Eating and Metabolism]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>].

### Water
- Adequate hydration and the use of external water therapies such as saunas and cold plunges can boost innate immunity [[water_filtration_and_tap_water_contaminants | Water Filtration and Tap Water Contaminants]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>].

### Sunlight
- Natural sunlight, particularly the infrared spectrum, has significant benefits for mitochondrial health and immune function through enhanced melatonin production [[impact_of_sunlight_and_red_light_on_health | Impact of Sunlight and Red Light on Health]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>].

### Temperance
- Avoiding toxins and maintaining a balanced lifestyle aid in sustaining strong immune function [[effects_of_alcohol_on_brain_and_body | Effects of Alcohol on Brain and Body]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>].

### Air
- Fresh air, particularly with natural compounds from forest environments, supports immune responses [[role_of_sunlight_and_darkness_in_mental_health | Role of Sunlight and Darkness in Mental Health]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:22">[02:37:22]</a>].

### Rest
- Quality sleep is fundamental, as poor sleep can impair the immune system [[improving_sleep_quality | Improving Sleep Quality]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>].

### Trust
- Psychological factors, including trust in a higher power or community, can profoundly affect immune health [[trust_and_social_relationships | Trust and Social Relationships]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:09">[03:12:09]</a>].

## Light Exposure and Mitochondrial Health

Dr. Schwell explored how exposure to sunlight, especially in the infrared spectrum, aids in mitochondrial efficiency and melatonin production in mitochondria. This type of light can penetrate the skin deeply, enhancing cellular health and providing an antioxidant effect that is crucial for stable mitochondrial function and immune response [[effects_of_different_wavelengths_of_light_on_health | Effects of Different Wavelengths of Light on Health]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>].

## The Role of Saunas and Cold Plunges

Exposure to heat via saunas can elevate core body temperature, stimulating the immune system by increasing interferon productionâ€”a critical component in combating viruses. Following heat exposure with cold provides a contrasting benefit by mobilizing white blood cells, thereby enhancing immune surveillance [[benefits_of_deliberate_cold_exposure_for_mental_and_physical_health | Benefits of Deliberate Cold Exposure for Mental and Physical Health]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:02">[02:01:02]</a>].

## Supplementation

Dr. Schwell highlighted certain supplements that could enhance immune function:
- **N-acetylcysteine (NAC)**: Acts as a precursor to glutathione, a major antioxidant, and reduces flu symptoms [[nacetyl_cysteine_and_its_health_applications | N-Acetyl Cysteine and its Health Applications]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:09">[02:25:09]</a>].
- **Zinc**: Plays a role in immune function but should be balanced with copper to avoid deficiencies [[rational_approach_to_supplementation | Rational Approach to Supplementation]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:05">[02:26:05]</a>].

## Conclusion

Incorporating these strategies not only supports better daily health but enhances the body's resilience against infections and potential illness. By aligning lifestyle factors with these [[impact_of_mindsets_and_behavior_on_immune_health | scientifically-backed approaches]], individuals can significantly optimize their immune system's performance and overall wellness.

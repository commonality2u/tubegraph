Postcycle Therapy (PCT) is an important phase that follows any cycle of anabolic-androgenic steroid use or exogenous hormone treatments, particularly in contexts like testosterone replacement therapy ([[testosterone_and_estrogen_balance | TRT]]) or other hormone supplementation protocols. In this article, we explore the concept of PCT, its significance, and some natural supplements that may assist in restoring the body's natural hormone balance.

## What is Postcycle Therapy?

Postcycle Therapy (PCT) refers to a regimen of pharmaceuticals and/or supplements taken to aid in restoring the body’s natural hormonal environment after a period of exogenous hormone use. The primary goal of PCT is to reestablish the body’s natural production of hormones, minimizing side effects associated with the discontinuation of artificial hormone intake.

During the podcast, Dr. Kyle Gillett provides insights into various aspects of PCT, highlighting its critical role in transitioning from an exogenous to a healthy endogenous hormonal state ([[hormone_optimization_using_behavioral_tools | hormone optimization]]).

## Purpose of PCT

1. **Hormonal Rebalance:** It helps to restore the natural production of testosterone and other hormones that may be suppressed during the anabolic steroid cycle ([[sciencebased_protocols_for_muscle_hypertrophy | muscle hypertrophy]] and maintenance).
2. **Reducing Estrogen Levels:** Prevents estrogen rebound which can often lead to unwanted side effects such as gynecomastia.
3. **Maintaining Gains:** Ensures that the muscle mass and strength gains achieved during the cycle are retained as much as possible ([[mechanisms_of_muscle_metabolism_and_energy_use | muscle metabolism]]).

## Natural Supplements for Hormone Boosting

In certain cases, individuals may opt for natural supplements to aid in the recovery of their natural hormone levels post-cycle. Below are some supplements discussed by Dr. Gillett and Andrew Huberman that can be useful in this context:

### Tongkat Ali

- **Mechanism:** Tongkat Ali, also known as Eurycoma longifolia, may reduce sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), thereby increasing free testosterone levels and acting as a selective estrogen receptor modifier (SERM).
- **Benefits:** It potentially raises androgen levels and provides mild estrogen control, contributing to a rebound in testosterone levels ([[supplementation_for_hormone_health | supplementation for hormone health]]).
- **Dosage:** Typically, a dose of around 400 mg per day is suggested.

### Fadogia Agrestis

- **Mechanism:** This Nigerian shrub is believed to increase luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, which can promote testosterone production.
- **Cycling Recommendation:** Dr. Gillett suggests a cycle of three weeks on followed by one week off to mitigate potential concerns about long-term usage (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:51">[01:53:51]</a>).

### Boron

- **Benefits:** Boron can help regulate SHBG levels and increase the bioavailability of testosterone.
- **Dosage:** A dose of around 3-6 mg per day is typical.

### L-Carnitine

- **Role in Fertility:** L-carnitine has shown promise in improving sperm quality and motility due to its role in fatty acid transport and energy production ([[understanding_fertility_and_germ_cells | fertility and germ cells]]).
- **Forms & Dosage:** Available as an oral supplement in L-carnitine L-tartrate or acetyl-L-carnitine forms, with injectable forms also available for higher bioavailability (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:57">[02:12:57]</a>).

## Considerations

Before beginning any PCT or supplement protocol, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional to tailor the approach based on individual health conditions and needs. Comprehensive blood work can also provide insight into which supplements may be most beneficial for optimizing hormone levels ([[blood_work_and_health_evaluation | blood work and health evaluation]]).

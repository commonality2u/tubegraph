In a recent podcast episode of the Huberman Lab podcast, host Andrew Huberman and Dr. Gabrielle Lyon delved into the significant role of mindset and psychological factors in adhering to health protocols. Dr. Lyon, an expert in geriatrics, nutrition, and health, highlighted several critical aspects of mindset that can substantially influence one's adherence to health and wellness routines.

## Setting Standards Over Goals

Dr. Lyon emphasizes the importance of setting standards instead of goals when it comes to maintaining health. She advocates for developing a framework where certain behaviors are non-negotiable, regardless of circumstances or feelings. This mindset involves committing to consistent actions, such as regular exercise and dietary practices, that are integral to one’s health routine, rather than setting temporary goals that may not sustain long-term health benefits. Dr. Lyon asserts, "Standards remain, goals come and go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:30">[02:48:30]</a>.

## Awareness of Points of Failure

A crucial part of maintaining adherence to health protocols is having an awareness of personal vulnerabilities and potential points of failure. Dr. Lyon points out that knowing where one tends to fail can help in devising strategies to avoid these pitfalls. She illustrates how predictable behaviors, such as excessive celebrations of success, can lead to disruptions in health routines. She notes the importance of understanding these patterns to maintain consistency in health practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

## Neutrality and Emotional Regulation

Neutrality in response to life’s fluctuations is another concept introduced by Dr. Lyon. She explains that maintaining a balanced emotional state can prevent the disruptive highs and lows that often derail health routines. By managing emotions and maintaining a steady course through life's ups and downs, individuals are better positioned to adhere to their health standards without being sidetracked by temporary emotional states. Dr. Lyon emphasises this approach as critical for long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:32">[02:52:32]</a>.

## Perception of Self-Worth

Dr. Lyon also discusses how an individual’s sense of self-worth impacts their health adherence. She posits that individuals often act in ways that reflect their sense of worthiness, and feeling unworthy of health can lead to self-sabotage. This psychological barrier must be addressed to ensure sustainable health practices. It’s essential that individuals cultivate a belief in their worthiness to be healthy, which can drive sustained engagement with health-promoting behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:32">[02:56:32]</a>.

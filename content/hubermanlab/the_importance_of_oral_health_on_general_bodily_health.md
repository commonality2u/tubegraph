### Oral Health, Generally

Oral health, often narrowly defined as just the care and appearance of teeth and fresh breath, plays a crucial role in overall bodily health. In the recent Huberman Lab podcast episode, Dr. Andrew Huberman emphasized [[effects_of_oral_health_on_overall_health | the interconnections between oral health and the general health]] of our body, advocating it as the seventh pillar of mental and physical health.

## Oral Health as the Seventh Pillar

Traditionally, the six pillars of health and performance include sleep, sunlight exposure, nutrition, exercise, stress management, and social relationships. Dr. Huberman proposes the inclusion of oral health as the seventh pillar, arguing that it significantly impacts cardiovascular, metabolic, and brain health as well as the prevention of various diseases (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>).

## The Oral Microbiome

One of the key discussions in the episode was about the oral microbiome, which is crucial to maintaining oral and overall health. The mouth hosts a vast array of bacteria, some beneficial and some harmful. It's not only a pathway but also a barrier, and maintaining a healthy balance in this microbiome affects the body beyond the oral cavity (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>). This topic relates to the broader concept of the [[gut_microbiome_and_overall_health | gut microbiome]] and its impacts.

## Remineralization and Demineralization

A fascinating aspect of oral health is the process of remineralization and demineralization. Remineralization allows teeth to repair themselves, particularly if cavities haven't deeply penetrated through the enamel (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>). This process depends heavily on the salivaâ€™s pH balance and can prevent cavities if managed properly.

## The Systemic Impact of Oral Health

Dr. Huberman highlighted that oral health has systemic effects crossing into cardiovascular and metabolic realms (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>). Poor oral health, particularly through periodontal disease, is linked with systemic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, complications of diabetes, and possibly Alzheimer's disease (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>). This reminds us of the importance of maintaining health through a [[nutrition_and_dietary_supplements | balanced diet and appropriate supplementation]].

## The Role of Saliva

Saliva, often overlooked, plays a crucial role in maintaining oral health. It helps to neutralize acids, providing a natural defense against cavities and gum disease (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>). Optimizing the production and composition of saliva is crucial for supporting the oral microbiome and facilitating the remineralization process (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>).

> Dr. Huberman underscores a strong connection between oral and gut health, emphasizing that these two components are contiguous and should be viewed as a combined aspect of health maintenance in daily protocols (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>).

## Conclusion

Maintaining optimal oral health extends beyond avoiding cavities or achieving white teeth; it serves as a foundation for overall body health. Implementing daily protocols that enhance saliva production, manage the oral microbiome, and encourage proper remineralization can lead to improved physical health outcomes. As Dr. Huberman suggests, re-evaluating and integrating oral health as a critical health pillar is imperative for fostering [[sciencebased_protocols_for_daily_life | comprehensive well-being]].

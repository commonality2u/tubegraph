Cannabis use among adolescents is a growing concern, particularly with the increased potency of modern cannabis strains. In the conversation between Dr. Andrew Huberman and Dr. Bonnie Halper Felsher, expert insights are provided on the implications of cannabis use in youth, covering aspects ranging from behavioral trends to potential health risks.

## Prevalence and Trends in Cannabis Use

Cannabis use in youth has largely been influenced by the varying legal landscape and the rising potency of the drug. Dr. Halper Felsher notes that today's cannabis is significantly more potent than in previous decades, with THC levels that are much higher than they were when many adults first encountered the substance. For instance, the THC content in what is now a typical joint could be equivalent to the potency of what would have been ten joints several decades ago (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>).

The prevalence of cannabis use is also notable, with anywhere from 10% to 20% of teens reportedly using some form of cannabis, be it through traditional means such as joints or through newer methods like [[risks_and_health_impacts_of_vaping_and_ecigarettes | e-cigarettes and vapes]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>).

## Cannabis Initiation and Social Dynamics

The transition into cannabis use often begins with social interactions and experimentation. Dr. Halper Felsher emphasizes that the initiation of cannabis, particularly in the form of e-cigarettes, can often be linked to an environment where nicotine is already present. This progression can happen as teens initially use nicotine-based products and then move towards including or substituting cannabis (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:16">[01:08:16]</a>).

## Health Risks and Psychological Effects

Cannabis use poses several risks, especially when initiated at a young age. The conversation highlights concerns over psychosis, with evidence suggesting that high THC cannabis could be linked, or even causal, to [[cannabis_use_and_its_potential_link_to_psychosis | psychotic symptoms in young males predisposed to psychosis]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>). This is particularly concerning as some symptoms may become irreversible, although it is not entirely clear whether all cases of cannabis-induced psychosis lead to permanent changes.

## Addiction and Coping Mechanisms

Many young users turn to cannabis as a mechanism for coping with [[coping_with_change_and_adversity | stress]], anxiety, and the pressures of adolescence. However, similar to other substances, cannabis use can quickly transition from casual to habitual, posing challenges related to [[addiction_and_recovery | addiction and dependence]]. Dr. Halper Felsher notes that about one in six youths using cannabis become addicted, often because they perceive it as less harmful compared to other substances like alcohol (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>).

## Addressing the Issue

In tackling this growing issue, Dr. Halper Felsher points to the necessity for comprehensive education and harm reduction approaches. This includes having open conversations about the risks of cannabis and providing youth with factual information, rather than employing fear-based tactics that might not resonate or convince. She advocates for dialogue that connects young people's aspirations and goals with their current choices to make them more aware of the consequences of their actions (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:01">[02:01:01]</a>).

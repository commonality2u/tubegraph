In a recent episode of the Huberman Lab podcast, Andrew Huberman and guest Stu McMillan discussed unconventional methods in fitness that could bring about improvements in power, speed, coordination, and overall health. A significant portion of the conversation focused on two often overlooked activities: skipping and striding. These activities could serve as zero-cost and effective elements in anyone's fitness routine, regardless of age or athletic capability.

## Skipping: Not Just for Kids

Stu McMillan describes skipping as one of the best plyometric activities, beneficial for people of all ages. Known as a children's activity, skipping is, in fact, a high-value exercise that can significantly enhance power, speed, and coordination while improving the muscle, fascial, and nervous system function [[impact_of_nervous_system_on_fat_metabolism | improving the muscle, fascial, and nervous system function]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">00:00:39</a>]. Skipping doesn't just make you feel like you're reverting to childhood play; it's also physically engaging in a way that primes your body for better physical performance in various settings.

### How Skipping Benefits Fitness 

Skipping involves a natural, rhythmic movement pattern that aids in developing core strength, burning calories, and improving cardiovascular health [[importance_of_cardiovascular_exercise_for_health | cardiovascular health]]. Moreover, skipping encourages an open, expressive movement pattern, which is often lost in adulthood [[mindset_and_mental_health | open, expressive movement pattern, which is often lost in adulthood]]. This quality enhances posture and can lead to improvements in mental well-being by elevating mood and boosting energy levels [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">00:40:00</a>]. The exercise also engages various muscle groups with every hop and skip, contributing to balanced muscle development and reducing the risk of injury.

### Suggested Routine for Skipping

Starting with a simple routine can help integrate skipping into your fitness regimen:

- **Duration**: Begin with 30-second intervals of skipping, followed by 30-second walks. Repeat this pattern for 10–15 minutes.
- **Environment**: Skipping can be done on any surface—grass, concrete, or track [[importance_of_environment_and_external_influences_in_accessing_creativity | done on any surface]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">00:56:00</a>].
- **Frequency**: Include skipping a few times per week as part of your regular workout routine.

## Striding: The Bridge to Sprinting

Striding refers to running at a speed that's approximately 75-90% of your maximum sprinting capability. McMillan suggests that many people mistakenly believe they are sprinting when they are, in fact, striding. This makes striding an ideal transition toward sprinting, enabling you to work on form, muscle memory, and cardiovascular conditioning without exerting maximum effort [[exercise_selection_and_progression_strategy | without exerting maximum effort]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:43">00:56:43</a>].

### Benefits of Striding

Striding can serve several purposes in a fitness routine:

- **Injury Prevention**: Unlike full-speed sprints, striding places less stress on the body, allowing muscles and joints to adapt progressively to faster speeds [[role_of_biomechanics_and_injury_prevention | progressively to faster speeds]].
- **Performance**: By working in a range just below maximum effort, striding can improve your overall running form and efficiency, aiding in faster sprint performances over time.
- **Fitness and Coordination**: Incorporating strides can heighten proprioception, improve coordination, and build better muscle patterns for running [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">01:00:00</a>].

### Transitioning to Striding

A simple way to integrate striding into your routine:

- **Warm-Up**: Before striding, ensure you're warmed up thoroughly—10-15 minutes of general flexibility [[fitness_protocols_for_endurance_and_strength | flexibility]] and aerobic exercises.
- **Execution**: Perform striding drills at a controlled pace, focusing on form and technique without exerting maximum effort.
- **Frequency and Duration**: Incorporate striding into workouts 2-3 times a week, focusing on short distances initially and gradually increasing as form improves [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">00:56:50</a>].

> [!info] Key Insight
> Skipping and striding are highly efficient ways to improve overall fitness, particularly for those seeking improvements in power, speed, and coordination. By incorporating both activities into your fitness regimen, you can tap into exercises that promote both physical and mental well-being, helping to build a holistic approach to fitness [[emotional_health_and_personal_development | holistic approach to fitness]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">00:39:00</a>].

Through skipping and striding, individuals can rediscover the joys of movement while also paving the path for improved physical performance and health longevity [[exercise_and_physical_fitness_for_aging | health longevity]].

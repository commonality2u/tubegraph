In a recent episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Andrew Huberman, a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine, delves into the fascinating interplay between food and brain health [[neurobiology_and_ophthalmology | neurobiology and ophthalmology]]. In this episode, Huberman offers insights into specific nutrients that are crucial for maintaining and enhancing brain function, both in the immediate term and for long-term cognitive health. The information presented is backed by peer-reviewed scientific studies, offering a reliable guide on nutrition for brain health.

## Essential Fatty Acids: Omega-3s

One of the primary nutrients highlighted is **omega-3 fatty acids**, which play a vital role in maintaining neuronal integrity [[the_role_of_omega3_fatty_acids | The Role of Omega-3 Fatty Acids]]. The brain's structural health is largely dependent on these essential fatty acids, particularly the EPA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid) variety. Huberman notes that omega-3s are essential not only for cognitive functionality but also for mood stabilization, potentially rivaling antidepressants in efficacy without associated side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

### Sources of Omega-3s

To ensure optimal brain function, Huberman recommends consuming fish such as mackerel, salmon, and sardines, which are rich in omega-3s. For those who do not favor fish, alternatives like **chia seeds, walnuts, and soybeans** can also provide substantial amounts of these fatty acids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

## Phosphatidylserine

**Phosphatidylserine** is another lipid-like compound that supports neuronal function. It is found abundantly in meats and fish. While some people opt for supplements, consuming phosphatidylserine naturally is beneficial for cognition and could help reduce cognitive decline associated with aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.

## Choline

**Choline** is crucial for acetylcholine production, a neuromodulator responsible for enhancing focus and alertness [[tools_for_improving_focus_and_attention | Tools for Improving Focus and Attention]]. Foods like **egg yolks** are particularly high in choline, but it can also be obtained from potatoes, nuts, seeds, and grains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.

## Creatine

Already known for its role in physical performance, **creatine** also supports cognitive function by serving as an energy source for the brain. Creatine supplementation, often in the form of creatine monohydrate, has shown promise in improving brain function, especially for those on vegetarian diets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>.

## Anthocyanins from Berries

**Anthocyanins**, powerful antioxidants found in blueberries and other dark berries, have been credited with reducing DNA damage and mildly offsetting cognitive decline. Incorporating a cup of these berries into your diet daily can be beneficial [[food_influences_on_cognition_and_longevity | Food influences on cognition and longevity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>.

## Glutamine

Lastly, **glutamine** serves a unique role in supporting both cognitive function and the immune system. Foods like cottage cheese, meats, fish, and vegetables, including spinach and parsley, are rich in glutamine. Huberman suggests that glutamine can also help curb sugar cravings by inducing feelings of satisfaction and satiation [[mechanisms_of_sugar_cravings | Mechanisms of sugar cravings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>.

> Ensuring a diet rich in these key nutrients can elevate not only your immediate cognitive functionality but support long-term brain health [[supplements_and_brain_function | Supplements and brain function]]. Alongside these dietary components, maintaining proper hydration and incorporating exercise [[physical_exercise_and_brain_health | physical exercise and brain health]] are crucial modulatory elements for brain health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>.

For those interested in optimizing brain function through diet, integrating these nutrient-rich foods can make a significant difference. By prioritizing these essential nutrients, you set a strong foundation for maintaining a sharp and healthy mind.

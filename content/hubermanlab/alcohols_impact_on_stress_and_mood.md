In a recent episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Dr. Andrew Huberman discussed the multifaceted effects of alcohol on the human body, with a particular focus on stress and mood changes. [[effects_of_alcohol_on_brain_and_body | Alcohol]], being a commonly consumed substance across the globe, has extensive impacts on our neurobiology and behavior, influencing how we experience stress and mood states.

## Acute Effects on Mood

When initially consumed, alcohol tends to produce a temporary increase in mood by elevating levels of **dopamine** and **serotonin**, two critical neurotransmitters involved in pleasure and mood regulation [[role_of_dopamine_and_serotonin_in_depression | (role of dopamine and serotonin in mood)]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:31">[01:27:31]</a>). This is often why people experience feelings of euphoria, relaxation, or talkativeness shortly after drinking. However, this feel-good effect is typically short-lived. It is followed by a prolonged period of decreased mood as the effects of alcohol wear off, leading many to continue drinking in an attempt to reclaim the initial euphoric state [[the_impact_of_dopamine_on_addiction_and_craving | (impact of dopamine on addiction)]].

## Long-term Impact on Stress

One of the most significant effects of alcohol is its impact on the body's stress system, especially the **hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis** [[sciencebased_tools_for_managing_stress | (tools for managing stress)]]. Alcohol consumption, even at low to moderate levels, can disrupt this system, leading to increased release of cortisol, known as the stress hormone, at baseline when not drinking (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:21">[00:40:21]</a>). This elevation in cortisol can result in heightened stress and anxiety levels in everyday situations when alcohol is not present in the system.

## Changes in Baseline Mood

Habitual alcohol use also brings about lasting changes in mood-related neural circuits. Chronic consumption can lead to a persistent decrease in mood and well-being when alcohol is absent, forcing individuals into a cycle of drinking to counter these negative feelings (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>).

## Alcohol-induced Anxiety

In addition to mood disorders, alcohol can induce **"hangxiety,"** a colloquial term for anxiety following a night of drinking [[hangover_mechanisms_and_remedies | (exploration of hangxiety)]]. This state is partly attributable to increased cortisol levels and other hormonal imbalances caused by alcohol consumption (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>).

## Long-term Neural Circuitry Changes

Moreover, chronic alcohol consumption is linked to alterations in brain circuits that manage **habitual and impulsive behavior** [[alcohol_consumption_and_brain_health | (alcohol impact on brain health)]]. These changes can exacerbate tendencies toward mood disorders and anxiety and increase dependency as the brain adapts to regular alcohol consumption (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:55">[01:26:55]</a>).

## Conclusion

While alcohol might offer temporary relief from stress and a boost in mood, its long-term effects include heightened baseline stress levels, disruption of mood-regulating hormones, and a potential increase in dependency. Understanding these impacts can help individuals make more informed choices about alcohol consumption and its place in their lives. If you're exploring ways to manage stress or improve mood, consider exploring non-alcoholic methods and consulting professionals for suitable interventions.

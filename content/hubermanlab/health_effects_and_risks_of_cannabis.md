Cannabis, often referred to as marijuana, contains numerous compounds that have significant impacts on the brain and body. While many are familiar with THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the psychoactive component, cannabis also contains CBD (cannabidiol) and CBN (cannabinol), which have their own effects. The various strains of cannabis—sativa, indica, and hybrids—along with type-specific strains (type 1, type 2, and type 3), have varying ratios of THC to CBD, influencing their effects on users [[effects_of_cannabis_on_the_brain_and_body]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Potential Health Hazards

### Mental Health Risks

One of the most concerning aspects of cannabis use is its potential to [[cannabis_anxiety_and_the_endocannabinoid_system | increase anxiety]] and depression over time. Chronic use—defined as usage more than twice a week—has been linked to increased levels of anxiety and depression. Moreover, these effects become more pronounced over the course of long-term use, even leading to the development of new mental health disorders in users who weren't previously experiencing such conditions [[impact_of_lifestyle_and_diet_on_mental_health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:22">[02:20:22]</a>.

#### Psychosis

Cannabis use, particularly during adolescence (ages 14 to 25), is associated with an increased risk of developing psychosis-related conditions later in life. This includes schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, especially in individuals with a genetic predisposition to these disorders [[genetic_predispositions_to_alcoholism]]. The risk is notably higher with the use of potent THC strains and frequent use [[cannabis_use_and_its_potential_link_to_psychosis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:38">[02:25:38]</a>.

### Cognitive and Developmental Concerns

Cannabis significantly impacts brain development, which continues until around age 25. Adolescents who use cannabis regularly show accelerated thinning of the prefrontal cortex, an area critical for planning, decision-making, and behavioral regulation [[understanding_adolescence_and_brain_development]]. This thinning is correlated with impaired cognitive function and executive ability [[impact_of_adolescence_on_brain_development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:14">[02:30:14]</a>.

### Neurological and Physiological Effects

Cannabis affects neurotransmitter systems extensively. THC can lower the efficiency of neural signaling by outcompeting endogenous cannabinoids, thus altering mood and perception beyond normal functional ranges. Over time, habitual use can lead to reduced cannabinoid receptor sensitivity, similar to how tolerance develops with other substances [[the_impact_of_dopamine_on_addiction_and_craving]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:30">[02:22:30]</a>.

### Cardiovascular and Respiratory Issues

Inhalation of cannabis via smoking or vaping has clear negative effects on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. It damages endothelial cells, which line the blood vessels throughout the body, increasing the risk of vascular diseases. These issues are independent of the active components like THC or CBD but are a result of the smoke and the method of consumption itself [[risks_and_health_impacts_of_vaping_and_ecigarettes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:02">[02:08:02]</a>.

### Hormonal Imbalances

Cannabis use elevates prolactin levels and can suppress testosterone, impacting libido and reproductive health [[hormonal_influences_on_aggression_including_testosterone_and_estrogen]]. The conversion of testosterone to estrogen is also increased, leading to potential reproductive and hormonal imbalances in both men and women [[cannabis_influence_on_creativity_and_cognition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:02">[01:59:02]</a>.

## Usage During Pregnancy

Shockingly, about 15% of pregnant women report using cannabis, typically in the form of edibles. This poses serious risks to fetal development, as the cannabinoids in cannabis interfere with endogenous cannabinoid systems crucial for neural development [[impact_of_neurotransmitters_on_fetal_development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:21">[02:14:21]</a>. The full implications of prenatal cannabis exposure are yet to be fully understood, but the preliminary data are alarming [[cannabis_effects_on_stress_feeding_and_development]].

## Conclusion

While cannabis and its derivatives like CBD have therapeutic applications, particularly in pain management and anxiety relief, its usage is not without significant risk. The adverse effects on mental health, cognitive function, and overall physical health necessitate a cautious approach to its consumption, especially among adolescents and pregnant women [[cannabis_anxiety_and_the_endocannabinoid_system]]. Cannabis use should be informed by a comprehensive understanding of its risks and should be approached with consideration of individual predispositions and lifestyle factors [[cannabis_use_and_legal_considerations]].

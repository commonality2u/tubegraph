In the latest episode of the Huberman Lab podcast, Andrew Huberman hosts David Goggins, a retired Navy SEAL and ultramarathon runner known for his extreme mental and physical resilience. The discussion delves deep into the principles behind [[building_tenacity_and_willpower_through_challenges | building inner strength]] and developing steadfast willpowerâ€”a central theme in Goggins' life.

## Understanding Willpower

David Goggins outlines his approach to developing willpower, emphasizing that it is less about natural talent and more about rigorous practice and discipline. He states, "I never forget how it is to be rock bottom and how to build that up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. For Goggins, willpower is not a gift but a skill honed by embracing failures and pushing through severe discomfort.

## The Role of Inner Dialogue

Goggins describes the importance of maintaining an internal dialogue that is constructive yet brutally honest. Unlike the typical positive affirmations many employ, Goggins insists on addressing his weaknesses head-on. By fostering what he refers to as a "second voice," he's able to counter the innate negativity with hard-fought assurance: "You don't just come out of it. You spend decades studying your mind and the human mind on how it functions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:12">[01:58:12]</a>. 

## Practicing Failure to Achieve Success

A critical step in Goggins' methodology is learning how to fail properly, which lays the groundwork for success: "I didn't teach myself victory first. I taught myself failure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:10">[02:20:10]</a>. He emphasizes the necessity of confronting and learning from setbacks to build a stronger foundation for future achievements.

## Scientific Insights: The Anterior Mid-Cingulate Cortex

Huberman brings a scientific perspective to the conversation by introducing the role of the [[superaging_and_the_anterior_midcingulate_cortex | anterior mid-cingulate cortex]]. He notes that this brain structure expands when people perform actions they do not want to do, contributing to long-term willpower and potentially increasing lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:38">[00:46:38]</a>. This scientific insight aligns with Goggins' life experience, wherein constantly pushing through discomfort fortifies his inner strength.

## Daily Practices for Building Willpower

Goggins provides an actionable framework to develop willpower through repeated exposure to tasks that challenge and suck, such as intensive exercise or rigorous study routines. He stands by the idea that the pathway to growth lies in discomfort: "It sucks to wake up every morning of your life and say, god, man, I'm not smart. So guess what I got to do. I got to study" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>.

The episode concludes with Goggins recounting his journey's labyrinthine personal corridors, underscoring routine self-reflection and preparation for repeated failure as key facets of his philosophy.

Peptides, small chains of amino acids, have gained increasing attention for their potential roles in health and performance enhancement. Researchers and clinicians are diving into the world of peptide therapies to explore how these compounds can be utilized for mental health, physical health, and overall performance improvement. In a recent discussion on the Huberman Lab Podcast with Dr. Craig Conover, a world expert in performance medicine, several aspects of peptide therapies were explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## What Are Peptides?

Peptides are essentially small proteins. They are naturally occurring and play crucial roles in various physiological functions. For instance, insulin is a peptide hormone that regulates blood glucose levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. In the context of performance medicine, exogenous peptides—those introduced from outside the body—are used to activate multiple pathways in the brain and body to improve health and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Popular Peptides and Their Uses

### GLP-1 Agonists

One of the most well-known peptides in recent years is the GLP-1 agonist, used primarily for weight loss and diabetes management [[glp1_and_novel_medications_for_obesity_and_diabetes | GLP-1 and novel medications for obesity and diabetes]]. Drugs like semaglutide and tirzepatide have been prescribed for their glucose-regulating effects and also for substantial weight loss as an off-label use [[impact_of_different_diets_on_health | impact of different diets on health]]. While there are concerns about the loss of lean body mass with rapid weight reduction, strategies like micro-dosing and combining with resistance training can offset these effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.

### BPC-157

BPC-157, or Body Protection Compound-157, is another peptide gaining traction for its anti-inflammatory properties and its role in healing injuries, especially in ligaments and tendons [[peptides_for_tissue_healing_and_repair | peptides for tissue healing and repair]]. Clinically, BPC-157 has been used extensively to treat chronic injury and inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. However, due to recent regulatory changes, alternatives like pentadecapeptide arginate are being explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:23">[00:45:23]</a>.

### Growth Hormone Secretagogues

Peptides like Ipamorelin and Tesamorelin are employed to stimulate endogenous growth hormone release [[growth_hormone_secretagogues_and_their_uses | growth hormone secretagogues and their uses]]. They're valued for their potential to improve sleep and metabolic health without the adverse effects of directly taking growth hormone. These secretagogues can enhance sleep quality by increasing growth hormone pulses during sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:18">[00:48:18]</a>.

### Cerebral Peptides

Pinealon and glycine, taken together, have shown promise in improving rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, suggesting a role in cognitive enhancement and mood regulation [[rem_sleep_and_its_function_in_human_health | REM sleep and its function in human health]]. Pinealon, in particular, is thought to have regenerative effects on the pineal gland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:03">[01:26:03]</a>.

## The Regulatory Landscape

Peptide therapies exist in a gray area of regulatory approval. While some peptides like GLP-1 agonists are FDA-approved, others have faced removal or restriction, making sourcing and legal pathway navigation a challenge for practitioners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:36">[02:11:36]</a>. It's crucial for consumers to work with healthcare providers to ensure they're accessing clean, safe, and legally-obtained therapies.

## Conclusion

The field of peptide therapies represents a fascinating intersection of biochemistry and clinical application, promising significant advancements in personal health management [[exploring_science_and_medicine_for_personal_growth | exploring science and medicine for personal growth]]. As research continues and regulatory conditions evolve, these therapies could become more widely accessible, offering new avenues for enhancing physical and mental performance. For those interested in pursuing such therapies, it remains imperative to consider medical advice and consultation with qualified healthcare practitioners to navigate this rapidly developing landscape effectively.

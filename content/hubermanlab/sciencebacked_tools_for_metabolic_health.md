In a recent episode of the Huberman Lab podcast, Andrew Huberman, a professor of [[neurobiology_and_ophthalmology | neurobiology and ophthalmology]] at Stanford School of Medicine, discussed a variety of science-backed tools for metabolic health. These tools are based on the synthesis of scientific research and practical insights from various experts in health and fitness. Here are some key takeaways from the episode.

## Soleus Pushups: A Metabolic Booster

One of the most intriguing topics discussed in this episode was a study from the University of Houston about a simple exercise termed as "soleus pushups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. The soleus muscle, a part of the calf muscle group, can significantly impact blood sugar regulation and metabolism when exercised correctly. This muscle is predominantly composed of slow-twitch fibers, making it suitable for endurance and stabilization tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### Study Highlights

- **Design**: Participants performed soleus pushups while seated, lifting and lowering their heels continuously.
- **Duration**: Exercises were performed for a total of 270 minutes throughout a day, divided into manageable sessions.
- **Outcomes**: Results showed a 52% reduction in postprandial glucose levels and a 60% decrease in insulin levels, even though the soleus only comprises 1% of total body musculature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

This suggests that even small muscle groups can have large systemic effects if exercised appropriately. While more research is needed, this exercise could be a game-changer for those leading sedentary lifestyles or those unable to engage in extensive physical activities.

## Cardiovascular Exercise and Metabolic Health

Dr. Huberman highlighted the importance of cardiovascular exercise for metabolic health, particularly emphasizing "zone two" cardio, which involves maintaining a pace that is challenging yet allows for conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. Achieving 180 to 200 minutes of this form of exercise weekly can have profound effects on metabolic and cardiovascular health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>.

### Key Benefits

- **Longevity**: Regular cardiovascular activity supports longer lifespan and healthspan.
- **Metabolic Efficiency**: Improves fuel utilization at the cellular level, promoting better energy management and glucose regulation [[impact_of_exercise_on_brain_and_body_health | impact of exercise and physical movement on blood sugar and insulin sensitivity]].
  
## Heat and Cold Exposure

Another science-backed tool discussed was the use of heat and cold exposure for enhancing metabolic health. Regular sauna use can lead to physiological changes that improve cardiovascular health and increase growth hormone levels, while cold exposure offers benefits in metabolic regulation and recovery from exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:31">[00:52:31]</a>.

### Protocol

- **Heat Sessions**: Spend about 15-20 minutes in a sauna, followed by a brief cool-down. This process should be repeated multiple times to maximize benefits [[heat_and_cold_exposure_for_health_benefits | health benefits of sauna]].
- **Cold Exposure**: Use cold baths or showers but avoid immediately after resistance training, as it might impede muscular adaptations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>. Cold exposure offers benefits in metabolic regulation and recovery from exercise [[impact_of_cold_exposure_on_athletic_performance_and_recovery | impact of cold exposure on athletic performance and recovery]].

## Conclusion

The episode provided valuable insights into how specific, targeted exercises and environmental exposures can dramatically [[improving_metabolic_health_through_lifestyle_changes | affect metabolism]] and overall health. By applying these science-backed strategies, individuals can enhance their metabolic health, improve blood sugar regulation, and support cardiovascular wellness. For those looking to optimize these areas, integrating soleus pushups into daily routines, committing to cardiovascular exercise, and utilizing heat and cold exposure can offer significant advantages.

In a recent episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, host Andrew Huberman, a professor of [[neurobiology_and_ophthalmology | neurobiology and ophthalmology]] at Stanford School of Medicine, sat down with Dr. David Yeager, a professor of psychology at the University of Texas at Austin. They delved into various educational strategies for motivating youth, focusing primarily on the practical applications of "[[growth_mindset_and_its_application | growth mindset]]" and "[[stress_as_a_performanceenhancing_factor | stress as a performance-enhancing mindset]]" in educational settings.

## Understanding Growth Mindset

Dr. Yeager explains that a growth mindset is simply the belief that one's abilities or potential in any domain can change and improve, provided the right conditions and support are in place. Many misunderstand this as the idea that trying hard will make anyone capable of anything, but it's more nuanced than that. The belief that potential is malleable can reduce the stress associated with thinking abilities are fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Motivating Students Through Field Experiments

One of the standout methods discussed by Dr. Yeager involves field experiments with high school students. He referenced a 2019 study published in *Nature*, where a brief growth mindset intervention significantly impacted students' academic success. The intervention consisted of just two 25-minute sessions for ninth graders, yet resulted in more students receiving good grades and enrolling in advanced math classes up to four years post-intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## Changing Interpretations of Challenges

Dr. Yeager points out the importance of how students interpret effort. In a fixed mindset, needing to try hard might signal lack of ability, leading to discouragement. A growth mindset, however, views effort as a natural path to improvement. He emphasizes addressing "[[effortbased_praise_versus_intelligencebased_praise | effort beliefs]]" in educational settings to avoid the oversimplified message of merely trying harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

## Stress as a Performance-Enhancing Mindset

The conversation turned to reframing stress as a positive force. Dr. Yeager noted that physiological responses to stress, such as increased heart rate and sweating, can be positive indicators of readiness if appraised correctly. The mindset that [[stress_is_enhancing_mindset | stress can be enhancing rather than debilitating]] can transform how challenges are approached, allowing individuals to harness physiological responses for improved performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>.

## Mentor Mindset

The "mentor mindset" was introduced as a solution to what Dr. Yeager terms the "Mentor's Dilemma" â€” the challenge of providing critical feedback while maintaining motivation. This mindset involves holding high standards paired with high support, sending a clear message that students are capable of achieving these standards with appropriate effort and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.

## Purpose-Driven Learning

One of the more profound components discussed was [[contributions_to_personal_and_societal_growth | purpose-driven learning]]. Dr. Yeager shared research indicating that students are more motivated by the potential contribution their learning can make to society, rather than future financial gain. When students view their studies as tools to contribute meaningfully to the world, they engage more deeply and persistently, even when tasks are tedious or difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:01">[01:35:01]</a>.

> [!info] Key Takeaway
> Schools and educators aiming to motivate youth should focus on cultivating environments where growth and challenge are embraced, [[stress_management_and_performance | stress is reframed as beneficial]], and contributions to society are highlighted as integral parts of learning.

These educational strategies discussed in the podcast illuminate pathways toward creating a more supportive and motivating educational environment for young learners, thereby setting the stage for increased engagement, persistence, and success.

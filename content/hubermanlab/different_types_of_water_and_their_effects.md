In a recent episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast, Andrew Huberman, a professor of [[neurobiology_and_ophthalmology | neurobiology and ophthalmology]] at Stanford School of Medicine, delves into the intriguing world of water. He examines various types of water and their effects on the body, encompassing everything from basic tap water to more esoteric forms such as hydrogen-rich and structured water. This article synthesizes his findings, offering insights into the importance of water's composition and how it can impact our health.

## Tap Water and Its Contaminants

Tap water is the most common form of water consumed worldwide. However, Huberman highlights the presence of various contaminants in tap water, such as disinfectant byproducts (DBPs) and fluoride, which can have adverse effects on health, particularly concerning reproductive and thyroid functions [[water_filtration_and_tap_water_contaminants | water filtration and tap water contaminants]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:17">[01:30:17]</a>. He recommends filtering tap water to remove these harmful substances, especially the excess fluoride that can disrupt thyroid hormones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:32">[01:35:32]</a>.

## Filtered Water

Filtered water refers to tap water that has undergone additional purification processes. Filters can range from simple carbon filters to more complex reverse osmosis systems. Huberman notes that while basic filters can remove many harmful elements, reverse osmosis water may lack essential minerals like magnesium and calcium unless supplemented [[influence_of_water_temperature_and_ph_on_absorption | influence of water temperature and pH on absorption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:01">[01:58:01]</a>.

## Distilled and Double Distilled Water

Distilled water is created by boiling water and then condensing the steam back into a liquid, a process that removes both contaminants and beneficial minerals. Huberman advises against using distilled water for regular consumption due to its lack of magnesium and calcium, which are important for health [[hydration_and_its_impact_on_health | hydration and its impact on health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:30">[01:57:30]</a>.

## Hydrogen-Rich Water

Hydrogen-rich water has been enhanced to contain higher levels of hydrogen, which reportedly has several health benefits. Huberman highlights a study showing that hydrogen-rich water can reduce inflammation and improve antioxidant activity in the body [[benefits_of_heat_and_cold_contrast_therapy | benefits of heat and cold contrast therapy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:04">[02:05:04]</a>. However, he notes that these effects are largely due to the increased pH of the water, which facilitates faster absorption by cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:32">[02:08:32]</a>.

## Alkaline Water

Alkaline water has a higher pH than regular water. Huberman explains that higher pH water can be absorbed more efficiently, although it does not alter the body's overall pH [[role_of_light_and_behavior_in_regulating_circadian_biology | role of light and behavior in regulating circadian biology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:08">[00:52:08]</a>. The alkalinity aids in better hydration, potentially reducing inflammation and improving cognitive function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:05">[02:09:05]</a>.

## Structured Water

Structured water, or "fourth phase" water, is a controversial topic. While some proponents claim it offers superior health benefits, Huberman indicates that there is little scientific evidence supporting these claims [[nutrition_and_dietary_supplements | nutrition and dietary supplements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:08">[02:14:08]</a>. Structured water is said to have a different molecular arrangement, but its supposed advantages over regular water remain scientifically unproven.

> Huberman suggests that if your tap water has sufficient magnesium content post-filtration, it is generally adequate. For those interested in experimenting with water types, hydrogen-rich water tables can provide an affordable option to increase water pH. However, the choice of water largely depends on individual health needs and preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:12">[02:13:12]</a>.

In conclusion, while there are various forms of water, the key takeaway is to ensure that the water consumed is free of harmful contaminants and has enough essential minerals [[nutrition_and_supplementation_for_health | nutrition and supplementation for health]]. The minor differences between types such as alkaline and hydrogen-rich waters generally pertain to absorption rates and the subjective experience of drinking them.

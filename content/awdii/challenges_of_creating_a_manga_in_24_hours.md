## Challenges of Creating a Manga in 24 Hours

Creating a manga is an intricate and time-consuming art form that traditionally takes months, if not years, to perfect. However, in a bold move, a content creator attempted to distill this elaborate process into a single 24-hour period. The journey presents several challenges that can serve as a learning experience for budding artists and writers.

### Lack of Experience and Skills

One of the first hurdles mentioned was the creatorâ€™s acknowledgment of not having comprehensive skills in manga creation, neither in writing stories proficiently nor in illustrating them. The fact that most manga take extensive time to conceptualize and perfect (00:00:52) only adds to the challenge faced in this tight timeframe. This echoes the struggles faced during the [[transition_from_university_to_anime_content_creation | transition from university to anime content creation]], where adapting learned skills to new formats is tested.

### Developing a Storyline

The video highlights the strategy of starting with a catchy, light novel-style title and developing a plot backward from there. This reverse engineering of stories can seem daunting, especially in limited time, and often results in a slew of ideas, many of which may not be fully fleshed out or appear nonsensical (00:02:22). Simplifying the scope was essential, and aiming for a 10-page one-shot rather than a full manga chapter was a pragmatic decision (00:03:56). This approach is reminiscent of [[the_creative_process_of_developing_a_manga_storyline | creative processes]] often needed to tackle complex storylines effectively.

### Time Management and Planning

Throughout the process, delays became evident. Starting with conceptual development in the library around 9 AM, the creator struggled with deciding on an idea and scripting by early afternoon (00:04:44). Overestimating one's capacity to manage time and handle unforeseen occurrences, such as technical difficulties with digital tools, proved significant as the day progressed (00:10:00). These challenges are parallel to those discussed in [[the_pressures_and_challenges_of_maintaining_viewership_as_a_streamer | maintaining high-pressure environments]].

### Technical and Artistic Limitations

The abrupt transition from digital to traditional paper drawing due to technical malfunctions, like a malfunctioning Apple Pencil, showed that equipment reliability is a tangible constraint (00:10:18). Moreover, artistic experimentation with the minimalistic style design faced setbacks, necessitating a shift to more realistic drawings that still did not meet ideal expectations (00:06:46). This reflects the [[concepts_of_minimalistic_and_realistic_character_design | balancing act between minimalistic and realistic designs]] in creative works.

### Sustaining Motivation

Maintaining creativity and motivation was another significant challenge highlighted in the video. Despite moments of low morale and exhaustion, the creator persisted, demonstrating resilience after a brief period of rest (00:12:01). The importance of mental breaks and re-evaluation of strategies became apparent after attempted failure within the tight deadline. These instances resonate with the [[reflections_on_pursuing_creative_endeavors_and_first_steps_in_manga_creation | introspective journey of starting creative endeavors]].

### Conclusion and Reflection

Although the goal of completing a manga within 24 hours was unmet, the process prompted reflection and resilience. Completing the piece over the following days illustrated that the essence of creativity often transcends rigid time constraints (00:12:10). The experience, while arduous, not only provided insights into manga creation but also underlined that starting any creative endeavor is a valuable step in personal growth and skill acquisition.

For those considering a similar challenge, remember the insights from this experience: manage your time wisely, anticipate technical difficulties, keep your story focused, and most importantly, enjoy the creative journey despite its hurdles.

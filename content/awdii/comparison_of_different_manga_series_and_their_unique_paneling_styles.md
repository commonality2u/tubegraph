Manga, with its intricate art and storytelling, is a unique medium that relies heavily on paneling to convey emotional weight, action, and narrative progression. Various manga series employ distinct paneling styles, each contributing to its storytelling in remarkable ways. This article delves into how different manga series utilize panel design to enhance their stories.

## The Minimalist Approach: *Blum*

In *Blum*, the approach to paneling is minimalist and wordless. Much of the story is conveyed through visuals alone, encouraging readers to interpret the plot through imagery rather than text. This technique creates an immersive experience where the reader is actively involved in the storytelling process, providing an open canvas for personal interpretation. The lack of words allows the imagery to captivate the reader, serving both as narrative and ambiance.

## Dynamic Panel Flow: *Berserk*

*Berserk*, by Kentaro Miura, is renowned for its dramatic use of paneling to convey action sequences. The manga employs a technique called compression and release, where smaller panels build tension, culminating in massive, sprawling panels that depict the climax. In action scenes, Miura especially focuses on the weight and impact of the protagonist Guts' sword, depicted through the expansive panels that follow a buildup of smaller, more detailed images. This technique effectively draws readers into the action, making them feel the force and speed of the battles.

## Emotional Impact through Panel Size: Tatsuki Fujimoto's Works

Tatsuki Fujimoto’s mastery of paneling is evident in his works such as *Look Back* and *Goodbye, Eri*. Fujimoto uses paneling not only to show passage of time but also to evoke deep emotions. In *Look Back*, he captures character development and emotional changes through gradually expanding panel sizes, creating a buildup to an emotional release that resonates with readers.

## Continuous and Fluid Paneling: *Witch Hat Atelier*

The manga *Witch Hat Atelier* presents an innovative approach to paneling, where panels are continuous and characters move seamlessly between them. The panels blend into one another, creating a fluid reading experience that mirrors the magical elements of the story. The manga often places multiple panels in a single frame to depict a sequence of movements or events, allowing the reader to absorb the story in a non-linear but intuitive manner. This fluidity not only aids in storytelling but also enhances the fantasy atmosphere of the manga.

## Introduction

The anime community on YouTube has seen remarkable growth and evolution over the years, similar to how gaming content gained traction in the early 2010s. As anime progressively becomes more mainstream, the YouTube anime niche has transformed, gaining more visibility despite its relatively small base of hardcore fans. Central to this growth is the influence of prominent creators like Gigguk, who have shaped and expanded the niche through innovative content and a deep passion for anime.

## The Early Days of Anime YouTube

In the late 2000s and early 2010s, the market for anime content on YouTube was notably sparse. Gigguk, who first entered the platform under the moniker "The Anime Zone," was one of the pioneers in this space. His early content was instrumental in tapping into the potential of YouTube for anime fans who were hungry for reviews and commentary when very few creators occupied this niche.

## Gigguk's Contribution and Rise

Gigguk's unique approach to content, characterized by fast-paced, sarcastic, and comedic reviews, resonated with the budding anime audience on YouTube.

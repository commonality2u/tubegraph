Character design is an essential aspect of creating stories, whether it be for manga, animation, or games. The approach to character design can significantly affect the storytelling and the connection it establishes with an audience. In a video challenging the [[challenges_of_creating_a_manga_in_24_hours | creation of a manga within 24 hours]], the creator delved into the concepts of minimalistic and realistic character design. Here, we explore these concepts drawn from the creator's experience in the video.

## Minimalistic Character Design

The idea of minimalistic character design is to express complex information and convey character traits through simple, fundamental shapes. This approach is often adopted to save time and resources, especially in projects with tight schedules, such as the [[challenges_of_creating_a_manga_in_24_hours | 24-hour manga challenge]].

### Fundamental Shapes
Minimalistic design relies on distilling characters down to basic shapesâ€”circles, squares, and triangles, each conveying distinct character traits:

- **Circles:** Represent charisma, harmlessness, and an endearing quality. These shapes suggest approachability and are often used for friendly characters.
- **Squares:** Symbolize reliability, uniformity, and tradition. Characters using this shape might appear dependable or rooted in conventional values.
- **Triangles:** Indicate cunning, dynamics, and competence. A triangular shape can give a character an edgy or clever appearance.

### Application
In the video, the creator initially attempted to implement a minimalistic style by integrating these basic shapes into the character designs to convey information effectively through silhouettes (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>). However, the challenges of this style emerged when the simplicity made the characters appear "stupid," prompting a shift towards a more [[utilizing_limited_resources_and_improvisation_in_creative_projects | realistic design]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>).

## Realistic Character Design

Realistic character design takes a more traditional approach, focusing on detailed, lifelike representations. This style can help establish a more profound connection with the audience by providing characters with a tangible, human-like presence.

### Transition from Minimalistic to Realistic
In the video, as the creator faced difficulties with the minimalistic approach, a decision was made to pivot to a more realistic style for the main character while maintaining abstract designs for background characters (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>). This dual approach allowed the main character to stand out while maintaining efficiency in the broader scene sense.

### Realism Benefits
Realistic character design allows for more detailed expressions and subtle emotional nuances, helping characters resonate more naturally with readers. It was an attempt by the creator to bring a deeper level of engagement and relatability to the primary character within the manga's [[the_creative_process_of_developing_a_manga_storyline | story concept]].

## Conclusion

Both minimalistic and realistic character design methods have their merits and are chosen depending on the project's demands, constraints, and artistic goals. Through the video creator's experience, it becomes evident that navigation between these types requires balancing simplicity and detail to achieve the desired narrative effect. The choice ultimately depends on how the creator wishes the characters to communicate with and impact their audience. Each style offers a unique pathway to storytelling, making character design an integral part of the creative process.

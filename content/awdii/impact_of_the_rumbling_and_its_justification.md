In the final chapters of the "Attack on Titan" series, the event known as 'The Rumbling' played a crucial role in the narrative and in shaping the geopolitical landscape within the story. The Rumbling is a pivotal action taken by the protagonist, Eren Yeager, and its implications and justification have been a topic of intense debate.

## The Justification Behind the Rumbling

Eren's decision to initiate the Rumbling stems from a complex web of foresight, emotional turmoil, and a sense of inevitability. Equipped with the Attack Titan's abilities to glimpse the future, Eren embarks on this catastrophic path, foreseeing a destiny partially out of his own control [[aarons_destiny_and_character_analysis | examined through Aaron's destiny and character analysis]]. One primary justification presented by him is a parallel to the strategy of Lelouch vi Britannia from "Code Geass": by becoming the focal point of the world's hatred, Eren believes he can unite humanity against a common enemy, thus supposedly paving the way for peace [[attack_on_titan_final_chapter_discussion | further elaborated in the final chapter discussion]].

Moreover, he attempts to justify his actions as a mechanism to secure the safety of his homeland, Paradis Island, from future retaliation by leveling the global playing field. This is a deeply controversial rationale, as it involves genocide to afford his people a few decades or perhaps centuries of security [[impact_of_political_power_and_status_in_attack_on_titan | showcasing the impact of political power and status in the series]].

## The Impact of the Rumbling

The Rumbling’s impact is immense and multifaceted:

1. **Humanitarian Impact**: It led to the annihilation of much of the human population outside Paradis Island, an act akin to genocide. The survivors faced the monumental task of rebuilding their civilizations from near extinction.

2. **Geopolitical Shifts**: With large portions of the world’s population decimated, the balance of power dramatically shifted. The threat of Paradis and its militarization gained significant weight, influencing the political dynamics and prompting a focus on recovery over revenge, given the weakened state of other nations.

3. **Social Repercussions**: Within Paradis, the aftermath of the Rumbling set the stage for the island's inhabitants to decide on their future relations with the rest of the world. The story depicts the main characters as ambassadors of peace, tasked with convincing the people of Paradis to forego war and strive for peace [[character_development_in_attack_on_titan | as part of the broader character development in the series]].

## Ambiguities and Criticisms

One significant ambiguity surrounding the Rumbling is Eren's own understanding of his motivations. He acknowledges that he does not completely understand why he proceeded with the Rumbling and conveys the hope that Armin, his friend, will lead humanity to a better future [[emotional_power_of_attack_on_titans_final_arc | capturing the emotional power of the series' final arc]]. This encapsulates one of the primary criticisms of the Rumbling’s portrayal; Eren’s motivations appear sometimes contradictory, a mix of deterministic resignation and strategic acumen.

The ending of "Attack on Titan," particularly the Rumbling, has sparked discussions about destiny, free will, and the morality of Eren's actions. Isayama, the creator, leaves the motivations layered and open to interpretation, thus encouraging readers to derive their own understanding.

In summary, the Rumbling epitomizes the central tensions of "Attack on Titan" — [[thematic_analysis_of_leadership_in_attack_on_titan | exploring thematic analysis of leadership]] — the conflict between survival and ethics, the pursuit of freedom and its costs, and the struggles within a world driven by fear and power. These themes are further explored through the complex legacy left by Eren Yeager's controversial decisions.

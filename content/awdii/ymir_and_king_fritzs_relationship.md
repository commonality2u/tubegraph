The intriguing and complex relationship between Ymir and King Fritz plays a pivotal role in the narrative of "Attack on Titan." This relationship not only provides depth to Ymir's character but also adds layers to the understanding of the series' lore.

## Ymir's Enslavement and Stockholm Syndrome

Ymir's entrapment in the past for over 2000 years is attributed to her love for King Fritz. This connection is explained through the lens of Stockholm syndrome, wherein a captive develops a psychological alliance with their captor after prolonged exposure. The [[character_empathy_and_psychological_exploration | creator's explanation]] suggests that despite King Fritz's abusive actions, Ymir's love for him bound her to his will for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Potential Alternate Explanation

The video's content provider voiced dissatisfaction with the Stockholm syndrome explanation, suggesting a preference for an alternative narrative linking Ymir's condition to the mystic elements of the series, such as being attached to the "hallucigenia," possibly turning her into a host bound to King Fritz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Mikasa's Role in Ymir's Liberation

Ymir's liberation from her curse became possible through Mikasa. The narrative posits that by killing someone she loved, Mikasa demonstrated to Ymir that she didn't need to be bound by a curse of love to King Fritz. This act supposedly allowed Ymir to finally grasp the concept of true freedom from her imposed shackles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Conclusion

The relationship between Ymir and King Fritz provides a rich context for the ideological and psychological themes present in "Attack on Titan." Although the notion of Stockholm syndrome offers one layer of understanding, alternative interpretations continue to spark discussions among fans, reflecting the complexity and depth of the series. This intricate relationship not only deepens Ymir's backstory but also enhances the overarching narrative of freedom and control that permeates the [[attack_on_titan_character_analysis | series]].

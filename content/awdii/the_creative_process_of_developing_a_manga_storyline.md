## The Creative Process of Developing a Manga Storyline

Creating a manga story is a challenging yet rewarding creative process that requires ingenuity, planning, and [[challenges_of_creating_a_manga_in_24_hours | iterative design]]. This article explores the approach taken by an individual who attempted to create a manga in just 24 hours, showcasing the steps involved and the creativity it demands.

### Inspiration and the Manga Golden Age

The creator begins by reflecting on the current landscape of manga, aptly described as a "golden age" due to the revival and release of many beloved series such as "Berserk," "Hunter x Hunter," and "Chainsaw Man" Part 2. Inspired by the abundance of manga, including works by fellow YouTubers, the creator asks themselves, "Why can't I do that?" despite acknowledging a lack of story writing and drawing experience, along with the intensive effort typically required for manga creation.

### Initial Story Development

The creative process begins at a library, a place filled with stories, where the creator employs the "light novel strategy." This technique involves brainstorming attention-grabbing titles similar to those found in popular light novels that often summarize the plot within their titles. Examples include popular series like "Naruto" and "Hunter x Hunter," which can be distilled into concise premises.

### Brainstorming and Plot Summarizing

The creator writes down 20 potential ideas, aiming for both novelty and feasibility within the 24-hour constraint. These ideas range widely in theme and are later narrowed down to a top five based on their potential to be both unique and manageable. Key considerations include the ability to convey a story in just 10 pages, significantly shorter than the typical 60-page manga chapter, and the potential for expanding the concept into a longer narrative.

### Concept Selection and Character Design

Ultimately, the concept of a "Twitch reaction streamer reacting to his life pass by him" is chosen. The storyline delves into the life of a streamer whose routine leads him to passively watch life's milestones from afar. This premise allows for both humor and depth as it explores themes of life stagnation and self-awareness. For character design, the creator opts for a minimalistic approach due to time constraints. By employing basic shapes—circles, squares, and triangles—to convey character traits, the protagonist and supporting characters are sketched with distinct symbolic meanings, illustrating [[concepts_of_minimalistic_and_realistic_character_design | concepts of minimalistic and realistic character design]].

### Storyboarding and Dialogue

The next step involves scripting and plotting each page, with an emphasis on how panels should flow like a paragraph, building narrative tension and progression. This includes creating dialogue and devising scenes to flesh out the characters’ emotions and the overarching world, utilizing [[role_of_panels_in_manga_storytelling | the role of panels in manga storytelling]].

### Challenges and Resilience

Throughout the process, technical difficulties arise, such as issues with an iPad pencil, which force the creator to adapt creatively by [[utilizing_limited_resources_and_improvisation_in_creative_projects | switching to paper storyboarding]]. Despite setbacks and fatigue, persistence leads to the completion of the manga.

### Conclusion

The act of creating a manga, especially under such tight constraints, illustrates the dynamic and demanding nature of storytelling. It reinforces the idea that the first step into any creative field is the most crucial. The creator challenges others to try their hand at crafting a manga in 24 hours, emphasizing that initial attempts, while imperfect, are vital stepping stones in the [[reflections_on_pursuing_creative_endeavors_and_first_steps_in_manga_creation | creative journey]].

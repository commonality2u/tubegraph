The Trash Taste podcast, while initially labeled an "anime podcast," has captivated audiences with its wide-ranging discussion on various topics. This diversity is a major reason why it has attracted so many listeners and why it's often considered one of the top podcasts on YouTube.

## Founding Members and Their Niches

The podcast was started by three prominent figures from the "anitube" sphere: Connor Colquhoun (C-Dog VA), Grant Masamune Gaara (Gigguk), and Joseph "Joey" Bisinger (The Anime Man). Each host brings unique perspectives and expertise, which contributes to the varied content of the podcast. Connor is known for his streaming and humorous content, Grant produces high-effort scripted videos, and Joey collaborates with major YouTubers like PewDiePie and MrBeast [[trash_taste_podcast_origins_and_creators | podcast origins and creators]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Podcast Production Quality

The production quality of Trash Taste is a step above many other anime-related podcasts. Before Trash Taste, the standard was often lower-quality audio discussions recorded over platforms like Discord. In contrast, Trash Taste offers a professional look and feel, with in-person discussions, which draws in a wide audience [[influence_of_geeks_plus_and_bookwalker_on_trash_taste | influence of Geeks Plus and Bookwalker]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## The Appeal of a Varied Topic Range

While anime serves as the connective tissue of the podcast, the hosts openly venture into a multitude of other subjects. This strategy not only caters to anime enthusiasts but also piques the interest of a broader audience. After all, only a minor portion of each episode is dedicated to anime talk [[impact_of_anime_and_otaku_culture_on_podcasts_popularity | impact of anime and otaku culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

Manga, much like any other art form, often serves as a mirror reflecting the societal and cultural issues of its time. Recently, several new manga series have emerged that delve into profound themes and social commentary, casting light on various societal norms and issues. This article explores some of these significant themes discussed in a recent [[new_manga_highlights_and_reviews | video]], where the host reviews a selection of manga, each offering unique insights and perspectives.

## "Sanda" and Declining Birth Rates in Japan

One poignant example is the manga "Sanda," written by Paru Itagaki, the creator of **Beastars**. "Sanda" revolves around a 14-year-old boy named Sanda, who is a descendant of Santa Claus. The manga sets itself against a backdrop of a dystopian future Japan, where the birth rate has declined steeply, and there are only 50,000 students left in the entire country. This drastic reduction in the youth population leads to a society where children are all housed in a single institution designed ostensibly to nurture them but in reality aims to strip them of hope and regulate every aspect of their lives, from education to marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

The manga uses its narrative as a lens to critique the social pressures and despair facing young people in contemporary Japan, amidst declining birth rates and a rigid societal structure that offers little room for individual hope and freedom. By incorporating characters like the eternally smiling 93-year-old principal who represents old societal norms, "Sanda" offers a robust social commentary on the need for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

## "Hiraeth Samurai" and Lifestyle Choices

"Hiraeth Samurai" presents another layer of social commentary, focusing on the theme of lifestyle choices and societal expectations. It follows Hiroto, a failed actor living a low-key life in Tokyo. The story contrasts the laid-back Hiroto with societal norms that glorify success and competitiveness. Hiroto's disdain for competition and satisfaction with his simple lifestyle serves as a direct commentary against the [[the_pressures_and_challenges_of_maintaining_viewership_as_a_streamer | societal pressure]] to view anything less than success as a failure. It highlights the idea that there is beauty in living in the present and finding happiness in everyday life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.

## "Sakamoto's Days" and Social Hierarchy

The video also highlights "Sakamoto's Days," a manga which subtly critiques the rigid hierarchies within Japanese society. Through its comedic and action-oriented storytelling, characters find themselves navigating a world where success is more often defined by oneâ€™s ability to conform to a predefined societal role, rather than by individual skills or talents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.

## Conclusion

These manga highlights illustrate how creators use the medium to offer incisive social commentary and address topical themes. From the commentary on declining birth rates and societal despair in "Sanda" to reflections on personal ambition and societal expectations in "Hiraeth Samurai," these works serve as a catalyst for discussion, encouraging readers to reflect on and question the norms and issues within their own cultures and societies. As these stories unfold, they not only entertain but also inform and provoke thought, showcasing the power of manga as a tool for [[exploration_of_unique_and_ongoing_manga | social change and awareness]].

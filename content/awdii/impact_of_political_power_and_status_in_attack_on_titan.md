The universe of *Attack on Titan* is not merely about the war against Titans but intricately entangled with political struggles and the complexities of human societies. The various layers of political power and status significantly shape the narrative and character development throughout the series.

## The Garrison Commanders

One of the less-discussed characters who embodies the impact of political influence is Commander Lobov. Despite having only 2 minutes and 31 seconds of screen time, Lobov’s journey encapsulates a powerful commentary on authority and status within the walls.

### Leadership Under Pressure

In Season 1, Episode 11, during the operation to reclaim the Trost District, Commander Lobov's interaction with the soldiers illustrates a facade of confidence to exert control, a theme recurrent in political dynamics. His aggressive command style is revealed when he confronts a soldier terrified of the mission, showcasing a leadership facade built on bluster rather than genuine courage or capability (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>).

### Superficial Authority

Later, in Season 3, Part 1, Episode 9, Lobov’s presumed appearance as a commander in the Orvud District demonstrates leadership that is shallow, reliant more on positional power than true strategic competence. His leadership is characterized by a hollow sense of authority that crumbles under pressure when the Rod Reiss Titan threatens the district (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>).

> Lobov’s eventual realization of what true leadership entails, as witnessed from Commander Erwin’s strategic brilliance, marks a turning point in his character arc. This transformation suggests the disillusionment with power obtained through legacy and not merit [[commander_lobovs_character_arc | (more on Lobov’s character arc here)]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>).

## Nobility and Government Control

Lobov’s speculated background as the illegitimate son of a noble, Oril, highlights the intersection of political influence and personal identity. Oril’s personality and selfish protective instincts mirror the entrenched elitism prevalent in the governing bodies, illuminating how personal interests often overshadow public welfare [[speculation_on_commander_lobovs_backstory | (speculated details on Lobov's backstory)]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>).

### The Noble Connection

The possible connection to nobility suggests that Lobov's initial position may have been obtained through nepotism rather than merit. This backstory exemplifies the pervasive influence of status and the lengths to which the ruling elite go to maintain power, often at the expense of effective governance.

## Conclusion: A Reflection on Power Dynamics

The story of Commander Lobov, though minor, serves as a microcosm of the broader themes of political power and status within *Attack on Titan*. It reveals how personal ambition, familial connections, and societal structures interplay to shape leadership, emphasizing Isayama's intricate world-building where even minor characters reflect the series' critical examination of authority.

**Attack on Titan** continues to challenge perceptions of leadership and power, presenting a narrative as much about the struggle against internal human issues as it is about the battle with titans. [[character_development_in_attack_on_titan | (explore more on character development)]]

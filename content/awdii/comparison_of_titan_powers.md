In the diverse world of *Attack on Titan*, the power hierarchy among the Titan Shifters is critical to the series' narrative. Each Titan, with its unique abilities and strategic advantages, contributes to complex dynamics on the battlefield. This article examines the key Titan shifters and how their powers compare to one another, based on rankings discussed in a recent [[ranking_methodology_in_anime_context | analysis]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>].

## D-Tier Titans

### Tom Ksaver
Tom Ksaver, a former holder of the Beast Titan, ranks lowest. His primary focus was on Titan research rather than combat, making him ineffective on the battlefield [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>]. His tenure with the Beast Titan was seen as a method of suicide via the 13-year Titan curse [[suicidal_ideation_in_storytelling | suicide via the 13-year Titan curse]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>].

### Pieck Finger
The Cart Titan, held by Pieck Finger, is mainly utilized for carrying heavy loads, including artillery. While it has extraordinary endurance, sustaining its Titan form for up to two months, its combat prowess against other [[titan_shifter_combat_strategies | Titans is limited]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>].

## C-Tier Titans

### Eren Kruger
Eren Kruger, a former holder of the Attack Titan, displayed its strength through rare glimpses such as the iconic boat lift. However, his combat abilities remained largely unexplored [[titan_rankings_and_abilities | largely unexplored]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>].

### Grisha Yeager
Grisha Yeager's ranking benefits from his acquisition of the Founding Titan. Although he showcased the potential activation of its powers, his circumstances within the walls constrained his combat development [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>].

### Ymir
Ymir's Jaw Titan stands out for its agility and sharp claws capable of penetrating the Warhammer Titan's crystal hardening. Despite this, Ymir's prolonged period as a pure Titan left her without some enhanced features seen in later Jaw Titans [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>].

### Reiner Braun
Reiner, the Armored Titan, possesses substantial resilience and destructive power through its protective plates. Despite this, Reiner has struggled in direct Titan combat and faces diminishing returns against [[impact_of_political_power_and_status_in_attack_on_titan | advanced human weaponry]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>].

## B-Tier Titans

### Annie Leonhart
Annie's Female Titan is versatile, boasting high speed, endurance, and adaptability to mimic other Titans' abilities. Her martial arts skills further enhance her [[attack_on_titan_character_analysis | combat effectiveness]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>].

### Porco and Marcel Galliard
The Galliard brothers' proficiency with the Jaw Titan places them higher in the rankings. Their agile, sharp-clawed Titan has proven formidable against other Titans, though disadvantaged by its small size [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>].

### Rod Reiss
Though not a shifter, Rod Reiss's massive size and heat emission pose significant challenges, comparable to the [[impact_of_the_rumbling_and_its_justification | Colossal Titan]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>].

## A-Tier Titans

### Lara Tybur
Holder of the Warhammer Titan, Lara Tybur wielded powers akin to full metal alchemy, creating formidable constructs. Despite her inexperience, her Titan nearly overcame Eren with assistance [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>].

### Bertholdt Hoover
Bertholdt's Colossal Titan, revered as the "god of destruction," boasts vast size, explosive potential, and defensive [[titan_shifter_combat_strategies | capabilities]]. However, his hesitation as a user lowered his effectiveness [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>].

### Zeke Yeager
Zeke's Beast Titan stands out with precise throwing capabilities and, due to his [[ymir_and_king_fritzs_relationship | royal blood]], the ability to control mindless Titans. His strategic mindset further cements his high ranking [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>].

### Armin Arlert
Armin, inheriting the Colossal Titan from Bertholdt, excels with [[character_development_in_attack_on_titan | strategic intelligence]] and willingness to use tactical nuclear-like explosions, enhancing his battlefield success [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>].

## S-Tier Titans

### Frieda Reiss
The potential of Frieda Reiss with the Founding Titan, wielding the power to alter Eldian reality itself, places her among the top despite her brief display [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>].

### Eren Yeager
Eren's hybridization of the Attack, Founding, and [[warhammer_titan_abilities | Warhammer Titans]] renders him nearly invincible. His mastery of martial techniques and strategic usage of Titan powers emphasize his dominance [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>].

### Uri Reiss
At the pinnacle is Uri Reiss, whose complete tenure and titanic power as the Founding Titan demonstrated unmatched potential and proficiency, solidifying the Reiss name as supreme [[impact_of_political_power_and_status_in_attack_on_titan | supreme]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>].

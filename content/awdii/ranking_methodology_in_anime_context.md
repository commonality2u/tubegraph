Ranking in anime often employs varied methodologies to determine the strength and effectiveness of characters or elements within a particular series. This article delves into the approach used in a recent video on ranking the Titan shifters from [[attack_on_titan_character_analysis | *Attack on Titan*]]. The video outlines a comprehensive method that could be applied more broadly to the ranking of characters in anime series. The primary criteria used in this methodology include combat power, usability, and strategic application of abilities, as well as potential through inherited abilities.

## Criteria for Ranking

### 1. **Combat Power**
Combat power is the foremost criterion used in determining rankings. This involves assessing a character’s strength, endurance, agility, and ability to deal or withstand damage in battle scenarios. For example, Titans with immense power such as the Colossal Titan, are ranked highly due to their *god of destruction* stature [[titan_rankings_and_abilities | Titans ranking attributes]].

### 2. **Usability and Application**
Besides raw power, a character's rank is influenced by how effectively their abilities are utilized in various scenarios. For instance, Zeke Jaeger's strategic use of the Beast Titan's long arms for precise bombardment earns him a high position [[titan_shifter_combat_strategies | strategic applications for Titan shifters]]. This criterion underscores the difference between merely having power and being able to leverage it cleverly.

### 3. **Inherent Abilities and Potential**
The inherent abilities and potential granted by specific characteristics, such as royal blood or particular Titan powers, significantly affect rankings. This criterion looks at prospective capabilities, even if the character hasn't fully realized them yet. Characters like Frida Reiss, who bore the potential of the Founding Titan, are ranked high despite their limited combat display due to inherent god-like abilities [[comparison_of_titan_powers | comparison of Titan powers]].

### 4. **Tactical Acumen**
The strategic mindset of a character and their ability to adapt and plan effectively during battles further influence their rank. This involves evaluating how well a character can strategize and lead, exemplified by Zeke Jaeger's battlefield strategies which enhance his ranking [[thematic_analysis_of_leadership_in_attack_on_titan | analysis of leadership in *Attack on Titan*]].

## Considerations for Ranking

> [!info] Importance of Context
> It’s crucial to factor in the specific context of each anime, as different series have varying rules and settings affecting how powers and characters interact.

In anime, a character’s rank can fluctuate based on narrative progression, character development arcs, or the introduction of new abilities or circumstances. Therefore, the ranking is not static but dynamic, evolving alongside the storyline and character growth [[character_development_in_attack_on_titan | character development insights in *Attack on Titan*]].

## Example Application

The ranking of the Titans in *Attack on Titan* follows these principles predominantly by assessing how each Titan shifter's unique abilities contribute to broader strategic capabilities and influence combat outcomes. A character’s ability to maximize their Titan's potential—either through raw power or strategic use—cements their position in the ranking schema employed in the video [[attack_on_titan_final_chapter_discussion | explore discussions on the *Attack on Titan* final chapter]].

Finally, the comprehensive ranking method applied in the video is a robust framework that can be adapted for analyzing character power dynamics across various anime, offering fans a deeper understanding of a series’ hierarchical landscape.

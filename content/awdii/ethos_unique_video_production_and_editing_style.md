Etho, a prominent figure in the Minecraft community known for his enduring Let's Play series, showcases a distinctive approach to video production and editing. Despite having a setup that might seem outdated by today's standards, he has cultivated a unique style that resonates with his audience.

## Simple Yet Effective Equipment

Up until two years ago, Etho was using a rather humble setup featuring a [[the_psychological_and_physical_toll_of_being_a_fulltime_twitch_streamer | Logitech G330 headset]]. This is a budget headset microphone, and Etho made the most of it even when the frame was broken and the padding was replaced with a Kleenex. The wire even showed signs of wear and tear. Moreover, Etho used **VirtualDub**, an editing software from 2001 that offers rudimentary video editing functionalities like only putting clips together [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>].

## Patchwork Style of Editing

Etho's video production involves a **patchwork style** of editing. He typically records something in-game, edits that single clip, then immediately attaches it to the existing footage. If he forgets to mention something or makes an error, he goes back in the game to record the next clip, which is then appended to the existing video. This iterative process continues, creating a video that feels both spontaneous and genuine [[ethos_patchwork_style_of_gameplay_and_construction | Patchwork Style of Editing]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>].

> "Now the way I normally record if you don't know is also a little bit weird. I generally will do something in game here, I'll record a single clip, and then I go straight to editing with that one clip" - Etho [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>].

## Viewer Engagement

Despite this seemingly hectic process, Etho’s videos maintain a high viewer retention rate—a key metric in the YouTube algorithm. Each clip in his video invites viewers to stay engaged as they become curious about the evolution of his builds and the process behind them. This method captivates the audience, making them eager to see the progression of his projects throughout the episode [[ethos_engagement_with_his_audience_through_comments | Viewer Engagement]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>].

In a digital era where high production values dominate, his videos stand out for their simplicity and authenticity [[ethos_unconventional_minecraft_lets_play_approach | Homey and Authentic Feel]].

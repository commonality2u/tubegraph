The final chapter of *Attack on Titan* has stirred substantial discussion among fans and critics alike. Though opinions vary, this analysis is based on a particular video podcast where the host offers a unique perspective on the chapter's events and themes. 

## Overview of the Final Chapter

The podcast begins by acknowledging the divisive nature of the series' conclusion, admitting that the chapter may not be perfect [00:00:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">00:00:07</a>), yet it is argued to fittingly wrap up the overarching themes and character arcs. The speaker promises that by the end of the discussion, viewers might gain a new appreciation for the chapter.

### Recap of Key Events

The chapter opens with Eren and Armin in Shiganshina, with Eren recounting his vision of the future through the Attack Titan's abilities. This foresight supposedly compelled him to initiate the Rumbling [[impact_of_the_rumbling_and_its_justification | and its justification]] [00:00:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">00:00:36</a>). Another motivation for Eren's drastic actions is to mirror a "Lelouch" strategy—uniting humanity against him so his friends could emerge as heroes of the new world [00:00:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">00:00:55</a>).

A significant revelation involves Ymir and her lingering affection for King Fritz, explained as potentially stemming from Stockholm syndrome [[ymir_and_king_fritzs_relationship | in their complex relationship]] [00:01:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">00:01:07</a>). This love-rooted binding is resolved when Mikasa's actions symbolize freedom from self-destructive love [00:01:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">00:01:36</a>).

Furthermore, Eren's manipulation in the past events, specifically directing Dina to eat Bertolt, illustrates his dual role as both protagonist and antagonist, reflecting his internal conflict [[aarons_destiny_and_character_analysis | and destiny]] [00:01:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51">00:01:51</a>).

### Eren's Motivations

Eren's motivations are multifaceted. Though some may consider annihilation unjustifiable, Eren's actions secured Paradis' future safety, garnered hero status for the alliance, and eradicated the Titan curse. It’s suggested that Eren is trapped by destiny, similar to how the royal family is bound by the past [00:06:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08">00:06:08</a>).

The podcast also elaborates on Eren’s emotional struggle, emphasizing that while Eren appears as a free agent, he’s actually constrained by fate—akin to Reiner's conflicting identities [[attack_on_titan_character_analysis | and character development]] [00:06:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55">00:06:55</a>).

## Character Growth and Future Implications

The chapter concludes with former central characters past their previous roles, stepping into new ones as advocates for peace between Paradis and the world [00:04:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54">00:04:54</a>). Their new purpose, along with Historia's strategic role in safeguarding peace through her position, suggests an ongoing narrative beyond the direct storyline, aligning Armin as the chronicler of their history [[character_development_in_attack_on_titan | and character growth]] [00:05:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29">00:05:29</a>).

The podcast observes that these elements may become more poignant when adapted visually [00:07:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19">00:07:19</a>).

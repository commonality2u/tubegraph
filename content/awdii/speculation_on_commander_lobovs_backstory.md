Commander Lobov, a seemingly minor character in the *Attack on Titan* series, has sparked discussion among fans due to his intriguing and subtly-developed backstory. Despite his limited screen time, weighing in at a mere 2 minutes and 31 seconds, Lobov's presence offers an elaborate yet understated narrative arc that raises questions and theories about his past and motivations.

## Initial Impressions and Screen Presence

When first introduced in the eleventh episode of *Attack on Titan*'s first season, Commander Lobov appears as a paradigmatic soldier, exuding confidence and authority amidst a frightened platoon. His assertive demeanor is initially interpreted as that of a leader unafraid to make sacrifices for the greater good of humanity (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>). However, keen observations suggest Lobov's projected strength is shrouded in insecurity, as evinced by his sweaty visage that betrays a layer of false bravado (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>).

## The Evolution of Lobov

By the time Lobov resurfaces in Season 3, Part 1, Episode 9, his transformation is evident. He ostensibly becomes aligned with Erwin's strategy against the Rod Reiss Titan, which necessitates using the Orvud District as a diversion. The resemblance to Lobov—amid his composure riddled with initial trepidation—fuels speculation that this is indeed Lobov, albeit in a matured form (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>). This encounter subsequently reveals Lobov's superficial leadership qualities, limited to rallying novice soldiers under the guise of overstated authority (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>).

## A Potential Royal Connection

One debated theory about Lobov's origin posits that he is the illegitimate offspring of Orly, a notable member of King Fritz's assembly. This hypothesis is grounded in shared personality traits, physical similarities, and the contextual clues regarding their respective positions and behaviors. Orly's self-serving disposition and misplaced sense of power mirror Lobov's early characteristics, suggesting a paternal link [[ymir_and_king_fritzs_relationship | related to King Fritz's assembly]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>).

## Circumstances of Birth and Ascent

Assuming Lobov is indeed Orly's son, his upbringing in the Orvud District as opposed to the capital suggests a clandestine attempt to obscure his illegitimacy. This connects to Orly's potential patronage of the underground, including brothels—a plausible birthplace for Lobov (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>). Subsequently, Orly might have utilized his influence to secure Lobov's role as a garrison commander, albeit without real-world merit or experience. Lobov's change in appearance over time likely reflects disillusionment during the coup d'état, leading him to lax in personal maintenance [[impact_of_political_power_and_status_in_attack_on_titan | due to the political machinations at play]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>).

## Final Moments

In Lobov's final appearance during the raid on Liberio, he exhibits significant character growth. His bravery in protecting the airship and refraining from attacking Gabi underscore his transformation from a figure of authority to a man of humility and compassion [[commander_lobovs_character_arc | marking the evolution of his character arc]]. This turn of character, however, does not spare him from a tragic end, as he is fatally shot mid-rescue (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>).

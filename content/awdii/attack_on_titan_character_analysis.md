## Overview of Titan Shifters

In "Attack on Titan," titan shifters are individuals who possess the power to transform into human-eating titans at will. The series highlights nine original titan powers, each with distinctive abilities and a profound influence on the storyline. Here, we explore a few of these shifters, emphasizing their development and roles.

### Tom Ksaver

Tom Ksaver, a former holder of the Beast Titan before Zeke Jaeger, mainly focused on titan research, lacking battlefield prowess. His strategic choice to inherit the titan because of the 13-year curse showcases a tragic dimension to his character. Reflecting on his lack of combat involvement, he sits at the bottom of the [[titan_rankings_and_abilities | tier list]], recognized more for his intellectual contributions than battlefield effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Zeke Jaeger

Zeke, the current Beast Titan holder, contrasts sharply with his predecessor. Known for his strategic genius and formidable combat skills, Zeke utilizes his titan’s unique abilities, such as [[titan_shifter_combat_strategies | transforming humans into titans]] and exhibiting immense throwing accuracy and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. His royal blood grants him an edge, enabling him to wield additional powers in combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

### Eren Yeager

One of the most compelling characters, Eren holds multiple titan powers: the Attack Titan, the Founding Titan, and the [[comparison_of_titan_powers | Warhammer Titan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Initially driven by revenge, his motivations and character evolve, showcasing growth in intelligence and strategic thinking, especially evident in recent seasons.

### Reiner Braun

Reiner, the Armored Titan, presents a tragic yet resilient character across the series. His titan possesses defensive capabilities due to its armored plates, providing protection but diminishing with evolving human technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Reiner’s battle experiences highlight his perseverance, despite consistently facing overwhelming odds and suffering numerous defeats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### Armin Arlert

Now the holder of the Colossal Titan, Armin combines his strategic brilliance with his titan power effectively. Unlike Bertolt Hoover, the previous Colossal Titan holder, Armin does not hesitate to utilize his titan's destructive power when necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. His high intelligence and quick thinking have saved countless lives, reflecting his value beyond raw strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

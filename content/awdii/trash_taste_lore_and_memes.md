This phrase turned into an iconic slogan of the podcast, used to describe various unique experiences or sensations that stand out in a memorable way.

## Garnt's Monk Experience

An intriguing piece of lore is Garnt's time as a monk. Of Thai descent, Garnt became a monk twice in his life, once as a teenager and again as an adult. This experience involved extreme ascetic practices such as waking up at 4 AM, sleeping on concrete, and eating only one meal a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. His monk experiences offer insights into why he often displays monk-like contemplative behavior.

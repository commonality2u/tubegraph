## Aaron's Destiny

### Vision of the Future

Aaron's journey is heavily influenced by his ability to see the future, a power granted by the Attack Titan. This foresight led Aaron to believe that he was bound to a certain destiny, which included the catastrophic event known as the rumbling. Aaron himself states that he didn't have a great deal of control over his destiny, as he could see the past, present, and future simultaneously [[impact_of_the_rumbling_and_its_justification | impact of the Rumbling]].

### Aaron's Role as Both Protagonist and Antagonist

A unique aspect of Aaron's character is his dual role as both the protagonist and antagonist. Aaron comes to realize that the true enemy he has been fighting is himself. By orchestrating events that resulted in his mother's demise and causing massive destruction through the rumbling, Aaron carries the weight of both a savior and destroyer. His actions were driven by his preordained destiny, a narrative twist that enriches his character complexity [[impact_of_the_rumbling_and_its_justification | impact of the Rumbling]].

## Aaron's Motivations

### The Aaron-Lelouch Parallel

One of Aaron's motivations for his drastic actions can be likened to Lelouch from "Code Geass." Aaron sought to shoulder the hate of the world to unite humanity against him, thereby positioning his friends as the celebrated heroes of the new world [[thematic_analysis_of_leadership_in_attack_on_titan | thematic analysis of leadership]].

### Ymir's Curse and Mikasa's Role

The story reveals that Mikasa was chosen by Ymir to free her from her curse, effectively changing Ymir’s perspective on love and servitude. Aaron's deep feelings for Mikasa are portrayed poignantly, hinting at a supernatural connection that fuels part of his motivation. Aaron’s complex emotions towards Mikasa, seen as contradictory by some, actually align with his character’s internal struggle [[ymir_and_king_fritzs_relationship | Ymir and King Fritz's relationship]].

## Emotional Roller Coaster and Growth

### Internal Conflict and Insanity

Throughout the series, Aaron experiences significant internal conflict. He vacillates between believing he is free and acknowledging he is as much a slave to fate as anyone else. This emotional turmoil is a key driver in Aaron's perceived insanity at various points in the story. His realization mirrors Reiner’s identity crisis in the series, further establishing the theme of characters trapped by their destinies [[character_empathy_and_psychological_exploration | character empathy and psychological exploration]].

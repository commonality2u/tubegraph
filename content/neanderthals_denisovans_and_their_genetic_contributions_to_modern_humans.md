The study of ancient DNA has significantly transformed our understanding of human history and evolution, particularly concerning the relationship between modern humans and archaic human groups like Neanderthals and Denisovans [[genetic_evidence_and_ancient_human_migrations | genetic evidence and ancient human migrations]]. Genetic data from these extinct groups, combined with sequences from present-day humans, has allowed scientists to piece together a complex picture of interbreeding and population dynamics [[the_role_of_cultural_and_technological_innovations_in_human_evolution | cultural and technological innovations in human evolution]].

## Discovery and Data Sources

Our current understanding is built upon several key data sources:
*   **Modern human DNA:** Sequences from people living today.
*   **Neanderthal DNA:** Sequences from multiple Neanderthals, who lived in western Eurasia for the last couple of hundred thousand years.
*   **Denisovan DNA:** DNA from Denisovans, archaic humans discovered through the sequencing of a finger bone found in a Siberian cave. This discovery was not anticipated, and they were identified as a new group of humans through their DNA.
*   **Admixed DNA:** Bits of DNA from archaic sources mixed into modern populations.

Collectively, these data sources have been used over the last 10 to 14 years to understand how modern humans are related to Neanderthals, Denisovans, and potentially other unsampled archaic groups [[biological_and_cultural_evolution | biological and cultural evolution]].

## Models of Human Evolution and Interbreeding

### The Standard Model
The prevailing model, developed since around 2012-2014, posits that:
*   Modern humans separated from a lineage ancestral to both Denisovans and Neanderthals approximately 500,000 to 750,000 years ago.
*   In this model, Denisovans and Neanderthals form a sister group to modern humans.
*   This framework is thought to explain the vast majority (approximately 95%) of the DNA lineages connecting these groups [[cultural_transmission_knowledge_accumulation_and_social_learning | cultural transmission, knowledge accumulation, and social learning]].

### Challenges and "Epicycles"
This standard model has faced challenges as new data emerges, leading to "epicycles"â€”additional complexities and mixture events added to make the model fit, similar to Ptolemy's astronomical models. Key discrepancies include:
*   **Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA):** The mtDNA (inherited maternally) shows a shared ancestor between Neanderthals and modern humans only about 300,000 to 400,000 years ago. This is significantly more recent than the whole-genome split estimate. Denisovan mtDNA, in contrast, is much more distantly related to modern humans, with a separation time of perhaps 700,000 years to a million years.
*   **Y Chromosome:** The Y chromosome (inherited paternally) shows a similar pattern. The separation time between Neanderthal and modern human Y chromosomes is also estimated at around 300,000 to 400,000 years ago, while the Denisovan Y chromosome is more distant.
*   **Gene Flow into Neanderthals:** Evidence suggests that 3-8% of Neanderthal DNA originated from a gene flow event from the modern human lineage into Neanderthal ancestors a few hundred thousand years ago. While it's tempting to attribute the younger mtDNA and Y chromosome lineages in Neanderthals to this event, the probability of both occurring by chance is very small (around 5% squared). Natural selection has been invoked as an epicycle to explain how these specific lineages might have become fixed in Neanderthals.

These discrepancies suggest the standard model, built by accretion and patching, might require fundamental re-evaluation [[human_genetic_and_cultural_adaptations | human genetic and cultural adaptations]].

### Alternative Models
Researchers are exploring profoundly different models.
*   One possibility is that Neanderthals received a much larger proportion (e.g., 30%, 50%, or even 70%) of their DNA from an early modern human lineage [[the_effects_of_agriculture_on_human_genetics_and_societal_development | effects of agriculture on human genetics and societal development]].
*   In such a scenario, modern humans and Neanderthals could be considered sister groups, just as Neanderthals and Denisovans are in the standard model. This blurs the distinction between "modern" and "archaic" humans.
*   The main modern human lineage itself was likely highly substructured in Africa, with deep splits comparable to those between Neanderthals and modern humans.

The location of the ancient gene flow from modern humans into Neanderthal ancestors (hundreds of thousands of years ago) was likely in the Near East or Western Eurasia. The Near East often acted as an ecological continuum with Africa, facilitating such interactions [[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | impact of AI on future technology and society]].

## Genetic Contributions to Modern Humans

### Admixture Events
Modern humans outside of Africa carry DNA from Neanderthals due to interbreeding events [[impact_of_diseases_like_yersinia_pestis_on_historical_population_changes | impact of diseases like Yersinia pestis on historical population changes]].
*   The primary admixture event that introduced Neanderthal DNA into the ancestors of present-day non-Africans likely occurred around 50,000 years ago (plus or minus 5,000 years).
*   Some of the earliest modern humans in Eurasia, known as Initial Upper Paleolithic individuals (dating from about 45,000 to 40,000 years ago), show evidence of very recent Neanderthal ancestry, sometimes within the last 2-8 generations. However, these early mixed populations often went extinct and are not the primary ancestors of most modern Eurasians.
*   Denisovan DNA is also found in some present-day populations, particularly in Oceania and parts of Asia, indicating separate admixture events.

### Proportion of Archaic Ancestry in Modern Non-Africans
*   While non-Africans today have about 2% Neanderthal DNA in their genomes, the actual proportion of Neanderthal ancestors at that time is estimated to be much higher, perhaps 10-20%. The reduction from a higher initial admixture to the current ~2% is thought to be due to natural selection acting against Neanderthal DNA segments.
*   Neanderthals, having lived in small populations for a long time, likely accumulated many slightly deleterious mutations. In the larger, mixed populations, these segments were selected against.

### A Shift in Perspective
An alternative way to conceptualize this is that populations in regions like the Near East, which were ancestrally Neanderthal or local, encountered continuous waves of modern human admixture. Over time, these local populations could have become genetically "modernized" from the inside, rather than being entirely replaced [[the_history_and_evolution_of_the_oil_industry | the history and evolution of the oil industry]]. This blurs the lines of simple replacement narratives.

## Biological and Cognitive Comparisons

### Brain Size
*   Large brain size appears to have been established *before* the separation of modern humans, Neanderthals, and possibly Denisovans. Their common ancestors likely had brains as large as ours. This suggests it may not be a case of parallel evolution in different regions but a characteristic of a sufficiently interconnected ancestral group [[cultural_evolution_and_its_role_in_human_history | cultural evolution and its role in human history]].

### Language and Vocal Tract
*   Neanderthals almost certainly used sounds and communicated in complex ways, amounting to some form of language.
*   Recent genetic evidence from epigenetic modifications (specifically, DNA methylation patterns) in ancient genomes offers intriguing insights.
    *   Studies by David Gokhman, Liran Carmel, and colleagues identified regions of the genome that were differentially methylated (genes turned up or down) in modern humans compared to Neanderthals and Denisovans.
    *   Among the regions systematically different on the modern human lineage, there was a strong statistical signal related to the vocal tract (laryngeal and pharyngeal areas).
    *   These epigenetic changes suggest a modification in the shape of the soft tissue of the vocal tract, specific to the modern human lineage and absent in Neanderthals and Denisovans. This shape is known to be important for the articulation of the range of sounds used in modern human language. These changes likely occurred in the last half million to few hundred thousand years [[neuroscience_and_ai_understanding_intelligence | neuroscience and AI: understanding intelligence]].

## The Fate of Archaic Humans

Around 70,000 years ago, multiple distinct human groups, including Neanderthals and Denisovans, existed. Today, only modern humans (Homo sapiens) survive. The precise reasons for the disappearance of other archaic humans are not fully understood [[ai_alignment_and_existential_risks | AI alignment and existential risks]]. It might involve numerical advantages of expanding modern human populations or a series of local extinctions where, ultimately, a modern human group was the "last one standing" after encounters and environmental pressures. While they disappeared as distinct populations, their genetic legacy continues in modern humans through interbreeding.

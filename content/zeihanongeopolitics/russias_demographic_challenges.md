Russia faces some of the world's most severe [[demographic_challenges_facing_russia | demographic challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. While it previously held the distinction of having the worst demographics, the ongoing conflict has pushed Ukraine into a worse position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Furthermore, data changes suggest [[Chinas demographic challenges | China's demographic situation]] has been worse than Russia's for over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Historical Impact on Demographics

Russia's demographic pyramid shows significant "gouges" resulting from periods of immense trauma in its history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>:
*   **World Wars** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>
*   **Collectivization and Mismanagement** The effects of collectivization and the mismanagement under Khrushchev and Brezhnev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Post-Soviet Collapse (1990s)** The most significant impact came after the Soviet collapse in the 1990s, when the death rate doubled and the birth rate halved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Recent Demographic Shifts and Military Implications

Since the start of the current conflict, Russian statistics conservatively indicate that 1.3 million Russians under the age of 35 have fled the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. A majority of these individuals are young men seeking to avoid the draft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Roughly two to three times more men have fled Russia than have answered draft summons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

This [[demographic_issues_in_russia | demographic collapse]] means that the pool of people under 35 theoretically eligible for the draft is very limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Even with honest statistics, the available pool for Russia to draw upon is much smaller than what the Soviet Union had <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, especially considering that half of the Soviet population was not Russian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### The "Last Generation" of Fighters
The current generation is considered the "last generation of fighting men" Russia possesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Russia has approximately 8 million men in their 20s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Between casualties from the war and those who have fled, over a million of them have already been lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This highlights a clear limit to Russia's military manpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

## Collapse of the Educational System

The Russian educational system began to collapse before the Soviet system did, specifically in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This means that the youngest cohort of individuals with meaningful technical training across society is turning 60 this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. These are the people responsible for maintaining critical infrastructure such as railways, the nuclear missile fleet, the military, and the energy complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

The ongoing conflict has revealed Russia's diminishing capacity to maintain its own economic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. This decline was previously masked or mitigated because Russia, as a commodities exporter, generated significant cash, allowing them to bring in foreigners to perform heavy engineering work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Examples include projects in north-central Siberia, such as the Yamal Peninsula's liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, and facilities on Sakhalin Island, all of which were built by foreign companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. With foreigners now gone and unlikely to return, and [[Chinas demographic challenges | China]] lacking expertise in deep offshore or Arctic operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, these capacities are set to disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

## Existential Threat and Leadership

The combination of the [[demographic_challenges_facing_russia | demographic decline]] and the collapse of the educational system means that the entire cadre of intelligence services personnel who were educated before 1986 now numbers less than 130 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Simple mortality is eroding the capacity of the Russian government to function, especially at the highest levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

Russian leadership views the ongoing war as existential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. They believe that if they do not secure geographical funnel points soon, they will lose the capacity to do so permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. They anticipate that Russia will lack even the theoretical capacity to defend itself from future aggressors in one, two, or five decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. This perspective is shared by all 130 individuals in the top leadership, who were part of the intelligence services coup in 1982 and have been part of Putin's inner circle, weeding out dissenting views for 23 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. They genuinely believe this is Russia's last opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

Even if a political change were to occur, such as a Moscow uprising after a catastrophic military defeat, the war might not end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Even figures campaigning for democracy, like Navalny, have expressed broad acceptance of the conflict, viewing Ukraine as Russian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. However, a post-Putin government would take years to establish itself, during which time Russia's economic situation would worsen, and its [[impact_of_russian_demographics_and_economy | demographic situation]] would become completely irrecoverable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

There is no "off-ramp" for Russia in the current conflict, meaning no end without one side being completely defeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. Russia has paid the price for a major war but gained no benefits, and is in a worse strategic position than when it started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Furthermore, any meaningful peace would require reparations and an admission of guilt, which would implicate the entire Russian leadership given the thousands of documented war crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. This, combined with the ongoing [[russias_geographic_and_demographic_exposure | demographic decay]] and physical losses from the war, means the Russian system would not recover from such a blow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. Putin and his circle are committed to the conflict "to the end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

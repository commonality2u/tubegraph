Historically, the Middle East was not a sought-after region, serving primarily as an intermediary in trade routes between more technologically advanced societies in the West and East Asia [00:57:00]. From roughly 1000 AD to 1500 AD, trade between these regions relied on coastal vessels, camels, and caravans [01:34:00]. This reliance on intermediaries led to massive markups, with product costs increasing by a factor of a thousand, making everyday goods from the East into luxury items in the West [02:18:00].

The development of deep-water navigation by the Spanish and Portuguese around 1500 AD allowed for direct sea routes to the East, bypassing the Middle East entirely [03:06:00]. Consequently, from about 1500 until 1900, the region became a "complete Backwater" [03:17:00].

The West's [[impact_of_industrialization_in_the_middle_east | industrialization]] and subsequent return to the Middle East, an area that had not industrialized, led to European powers like the British and French dividing the region into mandates and colonies [03:22:00]. This technological disparity was partly attributed to differing geographies: Western countries, with abundant rainfall, fostered diverse economic activities and a rising skill level, leading to political stability and technological advancement [03:49:00]. In contrast, the Middle East's limited areas of water allowed political authorities to easily dominate populations, hindering individual advancement and technological dissemination [04:24:00].

Today, the [[economic_and_military_relationships_in_the_middle_east | economies of the Middle East]] have regained significance globally, primarily due to the presence of oil [05:42:00]. This asset is crucial for the functioning of industrial economies [05:49:00].

## Oil's Influence on Global Powers

While North America is self-sufficient and even a net exporter of oil, making the Middle East's oil less of a direct problem for the US [05:54:00], European countries are significantly more reliant [06:09:00]. This reliance has been exacerbated since Russian crude is no longer a part of their energy equation [06:11:00].

The post-1950 environment in the Middle East is different due to the region's own [[impact_of_industrialization_in_the_middle_east | industrialization]] [06:35:00]. Though not at the same level as Western nations, groups like ISIS can easily acquire explosives and AK-47s, changing the nature of conflict from an imperial vs. non-industrialized dynamic [06:42:00]. The introduction of industrial technologies has also led to infrastructure development like roads and the acquisition of military hardware [07:39:00].

However, the governing systems in the Middle East are often brittle, top-down, and concentrated, deriving wealth primarily from oil cash [07:46:00]. This wealth does not translate into broader technological progress or societal strength, contributing to the proliferation of militant groups [07:56:00]. When these groups overthrow governments, it often leads to "complete societal breakdown," as seen in Egypt, Iraq, and Syria [08:24:00].

## [[US involvement in the Middle East and challenges in global security | US Involvement and the "Forever Wars"]]

Following the 9/11 attacks, the Bush Administration sought to combat Al-Qaeda by encouraging countries that harbored the group to act against it [08:36:00]. Recognizing the difficulty of conquering Iran, Syria, and Saudi Arabia directly, the strategy became to occupy Iraq with armored tank brigades to intimidate neighboring regimes [09:30:00]. This tactic successfully compelled Iran, Syria, and Saudi Arabia to pursue Al-Qaeda, significantly reducing its threat [10:29:00].

However, the subsequent attempt to rebuild Iraq into a Western-style democracy failed due to a lack of societal foundation [10:43:00]. The US presence has continued, driven by the desire to prevent the resurgence of militant groups like ISIS, leading to what are known as "forever wars" [11:42:00].

The fundamental challenge is that countries in the Middle East lack the foundation to form nation-states in the way Western or Asian countries do, largely due to their economic geography [11:33:00]. This means that the goal of preventing militancy requires an indefinite presence [11:47:00].

### The Dilemma of US Presence
The US faces a choice:
*   **Option A: Stay Forever** US forces would remain in bases, intervening with force when militant groups like ISIS emerge, then retreating back to bases [12:39:00]. This scenario implies perpetual engagement and ongoing attacks from groups like Iranian-backed militants [12:55:00].
*   **Option B: Leave** From a casualty perspective, leaving is simpler as the US cannot transform the region into a desired state [13:16:00]. However, the fear is that more undesirable militant groups would emerge faster and potentially attack US interests [13:48:00].

Currently, the continued presence of US forces, even if just in camps, has an unintended consequence: it helps maintain the existence of the Syrian government [15:06:00]. Under normal circumstances, without the US, other regional powers like Turkey and Israel would likely intervene more aggressively to "smash" militant groups, potentially leading to the collapse of the Syrian government within five years [15:10:00].

The region's limited capacity for food production, coupled with its reliance on energy exports (oil) to import food, means that widespread conflict could lead to an "outright civilizational collapse" [15:42:00]. The presence of US forces is acknowledged as one of the few things "holding the Darkness at Bay" [15:58:00].

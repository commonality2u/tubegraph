In early August 2023, Ukraine escalated its maritime strategy by directly targeting Russian commercial shipping, marking a significant shift in the conflict's naval dimension. This follows earlier successes with [[Ukrainian Naval drone attacks on Russian military vessels | naval drone attacks]] on military targets, forcing Russian vessels to relocate from Sevastopol to safer ports like Novorossiysk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Targeting of the Sig Tanker

On August 5th, 2023, Ukraine struck the "Sig," a Russian-flagged tanker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   The "Sig" typically operates between Novorossiysk, Russia, and the Syrian port of Tartus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   It primarily carries aviation fuel, which is crucial for Russian operations in Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   During the attack, the tanker was hit in the engine room while returning empty, causing damage but not sinking the vessel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Strategic Implications for Russia

If attacks on commercial shipping become a trend, it poses a severe threat to Russia's global strategic position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Russia's operations outside its borders, particularly in Latin America and Africa, rely heavily on the free movement of goods and fuel by sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. An inability to move men, material, and fuel in and out of the Black Sea could cause Russia's entire global presence to collapse due to a lack of fuel and logistical reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Declaration of Intent and Black Sea Safety

Following the "Sig" attack, Ukraine declared that it would consider every ship entering or leaving any Russian port as a potential military target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This mirrors Russia's own actions regarding Ukrainian ports since the war's beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

> [00:05:14] "If the ukrainians stick to their guns on this... then a lot of the Black Sea is going to become a no-go zone for Russian vessels of any type or any third-party vessels that want to go in and out of Russian ports."

The Ukrainians have demonstrated the capability to strike several hundred miles from their ports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, which is sufficient to reach any vessel operating in the Black Sea that is bound for or departing from a Russian port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Ukraine has given civilian ships two weeks to evacuate the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Insurance and Shipping Impacts

The declaration significantly impacts maritime insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>:
*   Standard annual hull insurance costs 1-2% of the vessel's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   Sailing into a war zone where active conflict occurs increases this cost by approximately a factor of 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   If civilian vessels are actively targeted, obtaining any insurance policy may become impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

This could lead to a near-total cessation of maritime shipping in the Black Sea region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, potentially taking offline major Russian export facilities like Novorossiysk and Tuapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. These ports are critical for Russian oil, ore, and grain exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Consequences for Russian Exports

Russia lacks the capacity to redirect these exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>:
*   Other major export points, such as Primorsk (Baltic) and Nakhodka (Pacific), are already operating at maximum capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   The Russian rail system is also at its maximum capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   Exporting through Ukraine via the port of Odessa is under embargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

If these Black Sea export routes are shut down, the crude oil wells that feed them could freeze in winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>, requiring redrilling and potentially taking them offline for years, or even decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

### Impact on Global Oil Markets

The Black Sea ports handle approximately 3 million barrels of oil per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, consisting of two main types:
1.  **Russian Crude:** Approximately half is Russian medium sour crude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
2.  **CPC Blend:** The other half is CPC blend from Kazakhstan's Tengiz superfield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, which is super light and super sweet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

If these volumes are removed from the market:
*   **Medium Sour:** Canadian Select (heavy sour blend) would likely be the primary beneficiary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   **CPC Blend:** U.S. Shale crude (super light, super sweet) would likely be the primary beneficiary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. U.S. Shale production has been expanding and is nearing record levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

### Geopolitical Reordering

The disruption would have asymmetrical impacts on major oil customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>:
*   **East Asia (primarily China):** Would struggle to find replacement volumes as Europeans have already secured alternative supplies post-war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **Mediterranean Basin (Europe):** Companies that have sworn off Russian crude and now rely on CPC blend would likely turn to U.S. Shale crude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

This scenario could profoundly [[economic_implications_for_russia_due_to_ukrainian_attacks | reorder the international strategic environment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. China, already experiencing an economic slowdown and an intensifying trade war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, would face significant energy supply challenges, while Europe might be able to largely replace its needs from North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. This would weaken Russia's strategic position in the water and its economic reach, limiting its ability to project power globally, while simultaneously hurting China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

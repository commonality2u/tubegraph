The future of relations between the United States and the Arab states in the Persian Gulf, particularly Saudi Arabia, is shifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Historical US Role and Global Oil Security

During the era of globalization, the United States required oil from the Persian Gulf not for its own consumption, but to fuel its allies, including Japan, [[impact_of_us_policy_shift_on_china | China]], Korea, Taiwan, France, Germany, Italy, and Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. These nations lacked sufficient domestic oil capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. To encourage their participation in the global order and the Cold War against the Soviet Union, the US guaranteed their fuel supply, meaning these countries did not need to develop their own navies to secure oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

The United States primarily sourced its own oil from within North America, and to a lesser extent, from countries like Venezuela and Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Crude imports from the Middle East never exceeded 20% of US supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

The shale revolution led to US crude imports from the Middle East dropping to virtually zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Saudi supertankers, once accustomed to waiting off the coast of Louisiana, are no longer needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Furthermore, oil imports from Africa ceased, and Venezuela's production declined drastically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The United States, along with Canada, is now largely energy self-sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### Strategic Priorities and Military Presence
Under the administrations of Barack Obama and Donald Trump, the United States became increasingly disengaged from global affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This is evident in the reduction of carrier presence in the Persian Gulf, from typically one or two at a time to rarely any, unless a conflict is actively flaring up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This reflects a shift in strategic priorities, with the US now focusing more on domestic issues and, to a lesser extent, East Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

For instance, when Kuwait discovered a large offshore oil field, the US response was indifferent, indicating that the security guarantee previously extended to energy development is now gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Impact on Saudi Arabia

Historically, the US went to great lengths to keep Saudi Arabia content over 75 years because securing Saudi cooperation guaranteed the participation of other Gulf states like Kuwait, the UAE, and Qatar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. However, in a post-globalized world where the US is energy self-sufficient and even an energy exporter, this dynamic changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### Changing US Role
The US is transitioning from being the primary security guarantor to potentially a disruptor, as maintaining reliable global energy supplies is no longer considered a strategic necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. As this shift occurs, the relationship with Saudi Arabia is expected to "tank" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

Saudi Arabia's vulnerabilities include:
*   Difficulty operating oil fields without a large expatriate workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   Reliance on a few export terminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   A navy not considered "worthy of the name" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

Future US actions could include embargoes, destruction of offshore loading facilities, or seizing tankers as they leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. The sentiment is that if the US no longer desires the oil and doesn't want others to have it, Saudi Arabia's primary value disappears, leaving behind a propensity for domestic violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### Current Transition Period
While the long-term relationship is set to change, the US is not yet completely disengaged. The Biden Administration's actions, particularly in the Ukraine War and efforts to contain [[impact_of_us_policy_shift_on_china | China]] in semiconductors, show that the US still values its alliance structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. As long as these alliances are perceived as valuable, the unimpeded flow of crude from the Persian Gulf remains important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

However, the US is preparing for a middle ground where it might compel the region to be more selective about its crude buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. If conflicts with [[impact_of_us_policy_shift_on_china | China]] escalate to military engagement, the US could place ships in the Strait of Hormuz to halt crude flow to [[impact_of_us_policy_shift_on_china | China]], effectively shutting down the entire region's exports within three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## [[middle_east_security_dynamics_postamerica | Middle East Security Dynamics Post-America]]

From the Saudi perspective, they historically believed their vast oil reserves would allow them to pay others, specifically the US, to defend them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Their assumption was that the US acted as mercenaries, and they could simply call upon the American military when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This belief was challenged by the 2003 Iraq War, which the Saudis did not support, yet it happened anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

As the United States withdraws, Saudi Arabia will need a new security guarantor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. The list of candidates is short, requiring a power with a blue-water navy capable of long-distance deployment or an army able to march into Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

*   **[[impact_of_us_policy_shift_on_china | China]]**: Lacks the necessary naval reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **Japan**: While possessing the capability, Japan has not sufficiently moved past its pacifist stance to invest in a large expeditionary army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. The US and Japan seem to be settling for co-dominion over the Pacific, including energy security for Japan, which likely excludes a security role in the Persian Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Britain and France**: The UAE has already formed a military cooperation with France, including a French base in the UAE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. However, the Saudis would prefer not to align with a European power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Turkey**: Could potentially provide security by marching through Iraq to Riyadh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. However, this would give Turkey direct access to Saudi Arabia's resources, raising the question of why Turkey would defend Saudi Arabia rather than simply taking control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

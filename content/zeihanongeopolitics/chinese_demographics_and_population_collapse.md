New data emerging from the United Nations has provided updated assessments on [[chinas_demographic_challenges | Chinese demographics]], revealing a severe situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This data indicates that [[chinas_demographic_decline_and_its_impacts | China's demographic challenges]] are more advanced than previously understood, pointing towards a significant population collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Rapid Aging Workforce and Soaring Labor Costs

China's workforce is experiencing the fastest aging rate globally, and arguably in human history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The number of new workers entering the workforce is significantly smaller than the number retiring, leading to a massive increase in labor costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Chinese labor costs have been rising at an unprecedented pace, exceeding that of any country in any era, including during the Black Death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Since 2000, the cost of Chinese labor has increased by a factor of 15, while the overall size of the Chinese economy has only expanded by a factor of roughly 3.5 to 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Despite these rising costs, China remains an industrial power today primarily due to the sunk cost of its existing industrial plant and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. However, industries that have chosen to relocate from China have found shorter, simpler supply chains elsewhere, with fewer political headaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Collapse in Birth Rates

Recent data highlights a dramatic collapse in the number of children under age 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. There are now approximately twice as many 15-year-olds as 5-year-olds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. A sudden [[impact_of_birth_rate_decline_in_china | collapse in the birth rate]] occurred around 2017, predating the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Over the subsequent five years, the birth rate among the ethnic Han population fell by roughly 40%, and by over 50% among many minority groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Anecdotal evidence suggests the birth rate dropped even further during COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Data Reliability and Underestimated Population Decline

Official Chinese state data on demographics is often unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. The Shanghai Academy of Sciences, a prominent research group, has stated that China has overcounted its population under age 45 by more than 100 million people in the aftermath of the one-child policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Additionally, after the COVID-19 reopening, the Chinese government stopped collecting data on deaths and COVID-related information, making it difficult to assess the true death rate impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

Internal estimates suggest that the official data for the youngest age cohorts may need significant upward adjustment to reflect the true situation, based on extrapolations from the Shanghai Academy of Sciences' findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Advanced Stages of Demographic Collapse

Considering these factors, it is probable that China passed the point of demographic no return over 20 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. India likely became the world's most populous country roughly a decade ago, not just recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Similarly, the average age of the Chinese population probably surpassed that of Americans around 2007 or 2008, not in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

This indicates that China is not merely in demographic decay but is in the advanced stages of [[chinas_demographic_and_economic_challenges | demographic collapse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. This decade is projected to be the final one where China can exist as a modern industrialized nation-state, as it will simply lack the necessary population to sustain this status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Implications for Business and Economy

For businesses operating in China, the [[demographic_and_economic_challenges_facing_china | demographic and economic challenges facing China]] are profound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. The labor force will never recover, and current labor costs are as low as they will ever be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Consumption is also at its peak and will not increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Even without considering political complications, operating environment issues, energy access, geopolitical risks, or regulatory risks, the economic numbers no longer support long-term investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. The primary reason for continued presence in China might be the sunk cost of industrial plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>, but this factor becomes less relevant with each passing year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

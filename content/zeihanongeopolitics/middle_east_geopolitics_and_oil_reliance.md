The future of relations between the United States and countries in the Persian Gulf, particularly Arab states like Saudi Arabia, is shifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The outlook for these Arab nations is not favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Historical Context: Globalization and US Engagement

During the era of globalization, the United States required oil from the Persian Gulf not for its own consumption, but to supply its allies, including Japan, China, Korea, Taiwan, France, Germany, Italy, and Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. These nations lacked adequate oil production capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. As part of the agreement to encourage them to join the global order and oppose the Soviet Union during the Cold War, the U.S. guaranteed their fuel supply, eliminating their need to maintain navies to secure oil themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

Historically, the US sourced most of its oil from within North America, followed by countries like Venezuela and then Africa, with never more than 20% of its crude coming from the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## The Shale Revolution and US Disengagement

With the advent of the shale revolution, the volume of crude oil the United States imported from the Middle East effectively ceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Saudi oil tankers would wait off the coast of Louisiana but were eventually no longer needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Imports from Africa also ceased, and Venezuela's industry collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The United States and Canada are now largely energy self-sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

The shift in US strategic priorities, observed during the administrations of Barack Obama and Donald Trump, has led to increased disengagement from the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The presence of US aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf has significantly decreased, now only occurring when there is an active conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The US is currently more focused on domestic issues and East Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. For example, when Kuwait discovered a large offshore oil field, the US expressed indifference, noting Kuwait's lack of offshore development capabilities and the absence of a US security guarantee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Impact on Saudi Arabia and [[Middle East security dynamics postAmerica | Regional Security]]

Saudi Arabia, a significant regional player due to its control of holy sites and claims over Islam, previously enjoyed a high level of US support for 75 years because of its crucial role in crude oil supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Securing Saudi cooperation typically ensured compliance from Kuwait, the UAE, and Qatar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

However, in a post-globalized world where the United States is energy self-sufficient and can even export to a select few allies, the role of the US shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Reliable global energy supplies are no longer considered a strategic necessity for the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This transformation means the US, once the world's primary security guarantor, could become quite the opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

The relationship with Saudi Arabia is expected to decline significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Saudi Arabia relies on a large expatriate workforce to operate its oil fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Denying them staff could hinder production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Furthermore, Saudi oil is primarily exported through a few terminals, and Saudi Arabia lacks a substantial navy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. The US, as the world's leading naval power, could potentially embargo Saudi oil, destroy offshore loading facilities, or intercept tankers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. These actions could be taken if the US no longer desires Saudi oil for itself or for others to possess it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

From an American perspective, without oil, the region is perceived as having a propensity for domestic violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. The relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia is expected to eventually break, though not immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. The Biden Administration's actions in recent years demonstrate a continued need for alliance structures, particularly in supporting Ukraine and "boxing in" China regarding semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. As long as the US values its alliances, there remains a need for crude oil to flow unimpeded from the Persian Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

A middle ground might involve the US forcing the region to be more selective about where it sells its crude oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. If conflict were to arise with China, a primary US action would be to deploy ships to the Strait of Hormuz to prevent crude from reaching China, effectively shutting down the entire region within three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## The Saudi Perspective and Search for a New Guarantor

From the Saudi perspective, they believe that sitting on the world's largest exploitable oil deposit should allow them to simply pay others for defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Up until the Iraq War in 2003, they viewed the United States largely as mercenaries who would fight their wars if sufficiently compensated with equipment purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The Iraq War, which the Saudis opposed but happened anyway, disabused them of this notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

As the US withdraws, Saudi Arabia will require a new security guarantor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. The list of potential candidates with a blue-water navy capable of long-distance deployment or marching into Saudi Arabia is short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

*   **China**: Does not have the necessary reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **Japan**: Has the capability but has not moved sufficiently beyond its pacifist stance to invest in an army capable of such deployments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. The US and Japan are likely to settle for co-dominion over the Pacific, including energy security for Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **Britain and France**: The United Arab Emirates has already entered into military cooperation with France, including a base in the UAE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. However, Saudi Arabia prefers not to align with a European power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Turkey**: Would either need a naval force to sail around the Arabian Peninsula to the Persian Gulf or would have to march directly through Iraq to Riyadh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. The latter option would create a superior military power with easy access to Saudi Arabia, posing a significant risk of takeover rather than mere defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

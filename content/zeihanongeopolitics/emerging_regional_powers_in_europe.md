As the [[Potential geopolitical shifts | global order undergoes a significant transformation]] and the United States re-evaluates its worldwide strategic relationships, a new dynamic is emerging within Europe. This shift, particularly underscored by the largest land conflict in Europe since World War II (the Ukraine-Russia War), highlights the changing roles and behaviors of key regional powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>.

## Key Emerging Powers

Three countries are identified as crucial for the remainder of this century due to their healthy [[Demographics and economic challenges in Europe | demographies]] and geographical positions that allow them to act beyond just Europe:
*   **France** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>
*   **Sweden** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>
*   **Turkey** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>

Other European nations like Spain, [[Germanys evolving role in European security | Germany]], Italy, and eventually Poland, are expected to decline demographically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:15">[03:00:15]</a>. The future of [[NATO and regional powers response to Russian influence | NATO]], the [[European Unions changing dynamics | EU]], and a post-unified Europe will heavily depend on how these three key powers interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:20">[03:15:20]</a>.

## Dynamics Between Regional Powers

### [[Frances potential leadership role in a new European chapter | France]] and Sweden
Currently, [[Frances potential leadership role in a new European chapter | France]] is increasingly aligning its talking points with the Swedish government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:11">[03:27:11]</a>. Historically, Sweden has emphasized energy security and manufacturing self-sufficiency, often in partnership with neighboring countries and in opposition to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. With Sweden no longer neutral, the French are now sounding very similar to the Swedes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. This suggests a very robust potential for partnership, provided ego does not become an obstacle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. Their coordination, or lack thereof, in Ukraine is expected to set a strong pattern for their future bilateral relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

### Turkey
Turkey stands out due to its radically different culture and economic structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. Its strategic position with a foot in the Middle East further complicates its role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. While there's a greater degree of cooperation now than in previous decades, this may not last long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. Turkey is seen as a dominant power in its neighborhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. If Russia loses the Ukraine war, Turkey has the opportunity for massive [[Potential geopolitical shifts | geopolitical expansion]], which could cause unease among other regional powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

### The "Swedish German French Axis"
A potential "Swedish German French axis" is emerging, where [[Germanys evolving role in European security | Germany]] is perceived as a junior and fading partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. This contrasts with a past mindset where [[Germanys evolving role in European security | Germany]] even considered winding down its military because of a belief in a new era of peace, a notion challenged by the Ukraine war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. The shift in European minds, prompted by the Russian invasion, highlights a changing understanding of security and the US's evolving role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.

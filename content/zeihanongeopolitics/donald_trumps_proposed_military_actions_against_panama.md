Donald Trump has stated his willingness to use military force against Panama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This proposal, along with potential actions against Greenland and Canada, raises questions about its feasibility and implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Historical Context of US-Panama Relations

The United States has a significant history with Panama, particularly concerning the Panama Canal:
*   The US built the Panama Canal in the early 1900s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   This was achieved after sponsoring a revolution and a coup in Colombia to separate Panama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   There is no infrastructure linking Panama proper to Colombia, which facilitated its separation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   For decades, the United States managed the Canal Zone as a military asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The term "zoner" emerged for Americans born and raised in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   Over time, Panama gradually gained more autonomy and eventually full independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   Under President Carter, a treaty was signed that reverted control of the Canal to Panama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   However, the United States retains a "first right" for military purposes, meaning Panama maintains the canal, and the US can use it when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Trump's Apparent Motivation and Challenges of US Takeover

Donald Trump's motivation for considering military action against Panama appears to stem from his disapproval of the canal's fee structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

A potential US takeover of Panama, while militarily "doable," would present significant challenges and costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>:
*   **Population and Economy** Panama has a population of about 4 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Its primary economic activities are money laundering or subsistence agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Integrating such a population into an American occupation system would be very expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Security and Migration** Full control of the Canal Zone would grant the US control over bridges linking Northern and Southern Panama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This could theoretically stop illegal migrants coming through the Darien Gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. However, it would necessitate internal security checks within an occupied territory of several million people, incurring high costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Colonial Administration** The United States has not effectively run a proper colony since the Philippines, an experience described as undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Cartel Activity** A US takeover would likely lead to Mexican or Colombian cartels moving in to establish an underworld to handle activities the US is not proficient at managing, as demonstrated during the War on Terror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Historical Precedent** The US did send military forces into Panama under Bush Senior to address the Noriega government's involvement in drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## Conclusion

While military action against Panama is "totally doable," it would result in the US incurring significant expenses that it is currently not responsible for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. This type of action is not strongly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

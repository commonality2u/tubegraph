Estonia, a country with a population of less than 1.5 million, has become a leader in cyber defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. It is considered to have "probably the best counter cyber in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Key Strategies and Capabilities

Estonia's strong cyber defenses stem from several key areas:
*   **Online Government Services** A significant portion of Estonia's government services have been moved online, making them relatively "happy proof" against cyber threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **Experience** The nation has extensive experience dealing with [[russian_cyber_crime_and_hacking | Russian cyber crime]] and attacks, as Russians have been targeting NATO countries, including Estonia, for several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This long-term exposure has allowed everyone to build up defenses, making systems less vulnerable than they were five or ten years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## International Cooperation

Estonia has been proactive in cooperating with other European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Notably, Estonia has worked closely with [[ukrainian_counteroffensive_strategy | Ukraine]] to help build up their cyber defenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This collaboration highlights a shared strategy of collective defense against evolving cyber threats.

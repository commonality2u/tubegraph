## Background of the Russian Government and Leadership Selection

The government of [[vladimir_putins_involvement_and_potential_motive | Vladimir Putin]] is characterized as a clique of individuals primarily from Saint Petersburg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. [[vladimir_putins_involvement_and_potential_motive | Putin]] served as vice mayor there during much of the 1990s, following his return from East Germany where he was a KGB officer tasked with "stealing things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. [[vladimir_putins_involvement_and_potential_motive | Putin's]] early belief was that the Russian system inherently struggles to produce things of value internally and therefore needs to acquire them through other means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This philosophy extended to his governance in St. Petersburg, where he collaborated with local organized crime to manage the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Upon becoming the national leader, [[vladimir_putins_involvement_and_potential_motive | Putin]] essentially replicated this model, bringing his existing associates with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

While [[vladimir_putins_involvement_and_potential_motive | Putin]] himself is considered "pretty clean" by Russian leadership standards, the individuals surrounding him, who perform the "dirty work" and "heavy lifting," have consistently been on the corrupt side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This system prioritizes the extraction of wealth from the populace and the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Consequently, the selection process for top positions does not favor effective managers but rather individuals adept at intimidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Organized crime operates in conjunction with the Russian government at a national level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This approach explains why [[vladimir_putins_involvement_and_potential_motive | Putin]] has been able to negotiate effectively with Chechen leadership, as they share a similar "warlords come robbers" mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

This pervasive corruption affects the entire system, meaning that many of the strategic thinkers who were integral to the Soviet system are no longer part of the Russian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This deficiency is particularly evident in military tactics and professionalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Despite [[vladimir_putins_involvement_and_potential_motive | Putin's]] personal preferences, he never cultivated the necessary skill sets or assembled a team capable of steering the country in a different direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Over time, competent individuals like former Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, who understood how to manage an economy, have fallen out with the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Prigozhin's Rise to Power

[[prigozhins_previous_activities_and_influence_in_global_affairs | Prigozhin]] ascended to power not due to his competence—he is described as a "former caterer"—but because he embodied the "hard man image" favored in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This ideological alignment, combined with the non-standard quality of top government leadership, allowed him to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

[[prigozhins_previous_activities_and_influence_in_global_affairs | Prigozhin]] is known for his brutal methods, including disciplining individuals with a sledgehammer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. He has also expressed views that the mass rapes, killings, and destruction of civilian infrastructure in Ukraine have been "far too soft" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

## The [[wagner_group_coup_attempt_in_russia | Wagner Group coup attempt in Russia]]

A deal was reportedly struck where [[prigozhins_previous_activities_and_influence_in_global_affairs | Prigozhin]] agreed not to attempt to overthrow the government or publicly humiliate the defense minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. In exchange, all [[wagner_group_coup_attempt_in_russia | Wagner]] personnel were to sign documents placing them under the control of the Defense Ministry, and [[prigozhins_previous_activities_and_influence_in_global_affairs | Prigozhin]] himself would go into exile in Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This outcome suggests he was "bought off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

Observation of the armed convoy allegedly moving towards Moscow revealed only a "couple of dozen vehicles," which would be easily stopped, especially with air power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. [[prigozhins_previous_activities_and_influence_in_global_affairs | Prigozhin]] was not part of this convoy, indicating that his true intention might have been to secure an exit strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. [[vladimir_putins_involvement_and_potential_motive | Putin]] had already decided approximately a week prior that the [[wagner_group_coup_attempt_in_russia | Wagner]] mercenary group would be integrated into the Defense Ministry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Therefore, [[prigozhins_previous_activities_and_influence_in_global_affairs | Prigozhin]] had already lost the underlying conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. The "coup" was likely a means for [[prigozhins_previous_activities_and_influence_in_global_affairs | Prigozhin]] to secure the best possible retirement package, as the defense minister's animosity towards him would make him a target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## [[implications_of_the_coup_attempt_on_putins_leadership_and_russian_military_strategy | Implications of the coup attempt on Putin's leadership and Russian military strategy]]

The [[wagner_group_coup_attempt_in_russia | coup attempt]] raises several critical questions:

### 1. Loyalty within the Military
The majority of [[wagner_group_coup_attempt_in_russia | Wagner]] forces joined [[prigozhins_previous_activities_and_influence_in_global_affairs | Prigozhin]] in his actions, and at least one unit of the Russian military's air defense system also sided with him, with rumors of others joining as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. This means that for [[vladimir_putins_involvement_and_potential_motive | Putin]], the most effective fighting force has questionable loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Even if [[wagner_group_coup_attempt_in_russia | Wagner]] soldiers eventually come under Defense Ministry control, they will not be viewed as reliable, which is a significant problem in the midst of a war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### 2. [[potential_scenarios_for_putins_removal_or_assassination | Putin's]] Diminished Authority
[[vladimir_putins_involvement_and_potential_motive | Putin]] has been publicly challenged not by pro-Western liberals, but by [[prigozhins_previous_activities_and_influence_in_global_affairs | Prigozhin]], an individual seen as "far to his right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This challenge cannot simply be dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Although the "coup" might not have been serious, the fact that it occurred and that a convoy advanced within a few hundred kilometers of Moscow reflects poorly on [[vladimir_putins_involvement_and_potential_motive | Putin's]] grip on the system, his command of military operations, and his ability to utilize law enforcement and intelligence services to maintain control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Even if [[prigozhins_previous_activities_and_influence_in_global_affairs | Prigozhin]] were to die publicly, the challenge has already been made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Anyone with concerns about the war or Russia now feels they have more political cover to speak out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. The state has been revealed as "somewhat Hollow," and [[vladimir_putins_involvement_and_potential_motive | Putin's]] leadership as "relatively incompetent and thin," posing a significant challenge moving forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

### 3. Impact on [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russian Involvement and Tactics]] in Ukraine
The city of Rostov-on-Don, which [[prigozhins_previous_activities_and_influence_in_global_affairs | Prigozhin]] briefly controlled, serves as the primary communications and logistics hub for the entire [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russian war in Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Being offline for two days means that [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russian]] forces in Ukraine lacked access to essential equipment, ammunition, and reinforcements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

Two major movements of [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russian]] forces out of Ukraine occurred:
*   [[wagner_group_coup_attempt_in_russia | Wagner]] was the first group to move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   Chechen forces were the second, supposedly pursuing [[wagner_group_coup_attempt_in_russia | Wagner]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   Some regular troops were also pulled to deal with the coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

These redeployments left many [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russian]] and pro-[[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russian]] forces out of position, creating opportunities for Ukrainian forces, particularly in the Donbas region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. The Donbas, which Russia conquered in 2014, lacks defensive works because Russia never anticipated having to defend it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. While Ukrainian forces have found it challenging to push south into Zaporizhzhia, they have found it relatively easy to push east into the Donbas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. Bakhmut remains a hotspot, precisely where [[prigozhins_previous_activities_and_influence_in_global_affairs | Prigozhin's]] forces were withdrawn from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

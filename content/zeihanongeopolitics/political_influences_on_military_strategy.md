The development and deployment of military technologies and broader [[us_military_strategy_and_current_status | US military strategy and current status]] are significantly shaped by political decisions and international relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>. Historical treaties, the geopolitical focus of different administrations, and the behavior of adversarial nations all play a crucial role in determining military posture and weapon system advancements.

## Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty

The INF Treaty, established during the late Cold War, was a significant arms control agreement that prohibited land-based missiles with a range between 500 km and 5,500 km <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:11">[02:08:11]</a>. The treaty's primary goal was to make Europe relatively immune from a blitzkrieg nuclear strike from the Soviet Union and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

However, the treaty's demise in 2019 was a direct result of political actions by Russia and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:40">[02:37:40]</a>:
*   **Russia** began ignoring the treaty and deploying its own weapon systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.
*   **China**, never a signatory, started implementing these missile systems in mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. China refused to work with the United States to expand the arms control regimen, instead deciding to proceed with deployments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

The abrogation of the INF treaty paved the way for the US to develop and deploy new land-based intermediate-range missiles, with discussions beginning within a year of the treaty's end in 2019 and implementation expected by 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

## US Presidential Administrations and Military Development

The pace of weapon system development in the US has been significantly influenced by the priorities and political approaches of various administrations:

*   **Clinton Administration (Early Post-Cold War)**
    *   During the early post-Cold War era, the focus was on fostering international friendships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.
    *   There was little incentive to develop weapon systems designed to target nations that were hoped to be allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>.

*   **W. Bush Administration**
    *   Relations with Russia and China began to sour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.
    *   However, the administration was heavily preoccupied with [[us_military_involvement_and_middle_eastern_politics | US military involvement and Middle Eastern politics]], particularly operations in Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.
    *   Russia was a more reliable partner for equipment transit to Afghanistan than Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>, leading to strategic back-burner status for other weapon developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.

*   **Obama Administration**
    *   Despite Russia's aggressive actions and China's rampant intellectual property theft and government hacking, President Obama was perceived as disengaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>.
    *   Little progress was made on new weapon systems or strategic updates for eight years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>.
    *   Obama "unofficially thought of the [[us_military_strategy_and_current_status | US military strategy and current status]] as an enemy" and was reluctant to empower it further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>.

*   **Trump Administration**
    *   Strategic updates and new weapon systems, which require complex processes, did not align with the administration's "by tweet" operational style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>.
    *   This period saw "strategic incompetence" for 12 years across the Obama and Trump administrations, allowing Russia and China to expand their influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.

*   **Biden Administration**
    *   Firm decision-making on the development and employment of new weapon systems, such as land-based intermediate-range missiles and new Tomahawk capabilities, began under President Biden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.
    *   Biden's long political experience means he remembers past weapon systems and treaties, providing necessary context for political decisions on military development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>.
    *   This has led to more robust and forward-looking security decision-making not seen since the George H.W. Bush administration in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>.

## Adversarial Political Context

The political behavior of other nations also directly influences US military strategy:

*   **China's Narcissistic Nationalism:** After the US demonstrated its satellite warfare capability in 2008 by quietly taking out half a dozen old satellites following China's destruction of one of its own, China became more "narcissistically nationalist" but did not fix its underlying problem of satellite vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.
*   **Chinese AI Control:** China tightly controls the type of AI that can be developed to prevent independent decision-making and independent means of existence, prioritizing social monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:22">[07:00:22]</a>. This contrasts with the US's more well-rounded approach to AI, including in weapon systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. This political control over technology development can limit military effectiveness, as seen with China's reliance on "dumb weapons" like ballistic missiles for targeting moving maritime targets without active in-flight guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.

The shift from the perceived "general incompetence" of past administrations to a more robust security approach under the current administration has direct implications for global power balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>.

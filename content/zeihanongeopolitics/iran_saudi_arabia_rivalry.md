The rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia is a significant factor in the [[Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East | Middle East]], often manifesting through proxy conflicts and strategic maneuvers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

## Proxy Conflict in Yemen
Iran specifically backs the Houthi Shiite group in Yemen's multi-sided conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. Iran supplies weapons to the Houthis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. This backing is strategic because Yemen is on the "far side of Saudi Arabia," Iran's "regional rival" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. Iran uses Houthi cover to launch missiles and drones into Saudi targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

Saudi Arabia has not typically taken the bait in a traditional sense, despite having invaded Yemen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. Instead, the Saudis use the conflict in Yemen for target practice, as they know they lack the military capacity to entirely root out the groups there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. This target practice is in anticipation of a potential future conflict where Iranians might drive through Iraq and Kuwait to reach Saudi oil fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. While considered "inhumane," this approach is seen as strategic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

In 2022, Saudi Arabia and the Houthis agreed to a peace deal or ceasefire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Following this, the Houthis, with Iranian support, have been stockpiling weapons in readiness for renewed hostilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

## Strategic Objectives
Iran's support for the Houthis is stronger than for groups like Hamas because the Houthis are Shia, fostering "more camaraderie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. For Iran, "needling Saudi Arabia," their primary regional foe, is a much more strategically important objective than needling Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.

Iran desires to keep the Houthis focused on Saudi Arabia, viewing it as the source of "money" and the location of Iran's "future conflict" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. Iran also prefers the United States to stay out of this specific rivalry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>. While engaging in actions that generate positive public relations across the [[Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East | Middle East]], Iran is not interested in "bleeding" assets for such activities, as their "real fight" requires all available resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.

## US Involvement and Implications
The United States has conveyed a message to Iran regarding attacks on US naval assets:
> "You do what you feel you need to just know that if you target us again this is going to be a lot more involved and it's not just going to be the Houthis that are getting shot back at" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

This implies potential direct repercussions for Iran if US forces are targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. Iran's need for the Strait of Hormuz for its oil exports provides a potential point of leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.

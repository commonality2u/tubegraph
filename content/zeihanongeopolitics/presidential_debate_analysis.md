Following the recent presidential debate, a significant volume of requests were made for an update on the [[2024_us_presidential_election_predictions | election forecast]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The debate showcased contrasting cognitive states between the two main candidates.

## Joe Biden's Performance and Cognitive State

[[joe_bidens_cognitive_state | Joe Biden]] appeared confused, lost, and seemingly unaware of his surroundings during the debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Many of his early responses were described as "nonsensical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The term used to describe his condition is "diluting," indicating a loss of control over the connection between his memories, life context, and present reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This manifests as slowness and confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, a pattern observed with increasing rapidity in press conferences, the Oval Office, and briefings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

At 81 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, the number of "bad days" for [[joe_bidens_cognitive_state | Joe Biden]] is beginning to outweigh the "good days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The assessment is that he is no longer fit for office, and a vote for him is considered a vote against national stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Donald Trump's Performance and Cognitive State

During the debate, an estimated 75% to 80% of [[donald_trumps_cognitive_state | Donald Trump's]] statements were "bald-faced lies," many of which have been disproven in court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Some of his new false claims were sourced from Vivek Ramaswamy's past Republican primary rhetoric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

The term for [[donald_trumps_cognitive_state | Donald Trump's]] cognitive state is "dementing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This implies he is very sure of his reality because he has created it himself, living in a self-made mental bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. When challenged, he tends to react with anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, a characteristic that has accelerated since his 2020 election loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

At 79 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, [[donald_trumps_cognitive_state | Donald Trump]] is also experiencing a decline where bad days outnumber good ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. He is deemed no longer fit to be president, and a vote for him is similarly considered a vote against national stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. His particular form of dementia includes the insistence that the 2020 election was stolen, despite his own administration's officials confirming it as a clean election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This stance threatens "independents" by implying that general elections are inconsequential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## Impact on the Election Forecast

Despite the debate's outcomes, the overall assessment remains that this is [[2024_us_presidential_election_predictions | Biden's election]] as long as he remains alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The rationale is based on the influence of "true independents"â€”the 10% of voters who decide every modern American election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Neither candidate is appealing to this group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

Trump's insistence that general elections don't matter and that everything should be decided in primaries (where his "Maga crowd" consistently shows up) fundamentally undermines the independent vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. If independents, disgusted with both choices, simply do not show up to vote, that outcome would favor [[joe_bidens_cognitive_state | Biden]] because there are more registered Democrats than Republicans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Potential Paths Forward

### Scenario 1: The Status Quo
The most likely path, as identified previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, involves a choice between a "deluded" candidate and one whose "dementia will destroy your ability to vote from the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Given the voter demographics, this path still leads to a [[2024_us_presidential_election_predictions | Biden]] victory if independents are disenfranchised or abstain.

### Scenario 2: A New Democratic Candidate
There is a possibility that [[joe_bidens_cognitive_state | Joe Biden's]] friends and colleagues might advise him to step down, allowing for a more capable candidate to run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. If he willingly steps down, it could lead to an [[potential_for_open_democratic_convention | open convention]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

However, the [[democratic_and_republican_nomination_processes | Democratic party's ability to generate talent]] is seen as hampered, partly attributed to Barack Obama's approach to politics, which centered around himself and prevented a new generation of leaders from rising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. This has left the party's power brokers as older figures like Schumer and Pelosi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. As a result, the primary system tends to favor "ideological idiots" like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

An [[potential_for_open_democratic_convention | open convention]] could potentially allow "normal politicians," particularly governors, to enter the race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Governors are typically favored due to their experience with day-to-day issues and cross-aisle governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Such a scenario could lead to a "complete blowout" victory for Democrats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, though it also carries the risk of an un-electable candidate like Elizabeth Warren emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

On the Republican side, an [[potential_for_open_democratic_convention | open convention]] or a change in candidate is highly unlikely. [[donald_trumps_cognitive_state | Donald Trump]] has effectively destroyed and purged the Republican Party of anyone opposed to him, establishing a firm grip on the Republican National Committee by replacing experienced staff with loyalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This means [[donald_trumps_cognitive_state | Trump]] is likely to remain the Republican nominee, even if he were to die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

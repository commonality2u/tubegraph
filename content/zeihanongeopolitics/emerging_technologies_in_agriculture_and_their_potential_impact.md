New technological advancements, particularly those driven by data processing, are significantly transforming the agricultural sector, much like they have impacted satellite communications, [[advancements_and_limitations_in_artificial_intelligence | AI]], and the shale industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. This shift is expected to revolutionize how food is produced, leading to substantial increases in yields and efficiency.

## Key Agricultural Innovations

### New Cultivars and Gene Editing
Significant progress in cracking and mapping the human genome has led to advancements in agriculture, enabling the development of new cultivars that prioritize fruit production over stock growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. For instance, corn plants, which were once 12-13 feet tall in Iowa, are now half that height but produce twice as much corn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. These gene-editing and GMO technologies are massively increasing yields, provided there is access to the necessary scientific supply chain for seed production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

### Artificial Intelligence in Agriculture
The integration of [[advancements_and_limitations_in_artificial_intelligence | AI]] into agriculture offers the possibility of individualized care for each plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. By moving away from broadcasting methods, the cost of inputs such as pesticides and fertilizers can be dramatically reduced, even as the yield per plant increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

## Projected Impact and Self-Sufficiency
It is anticipated that by 2032, agricultural output for all row crops in the United States could roughly double, or even increase further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. A key advantage of these agricultural advancements is their independence from issues affecting other technological sectors. For example, the ability to scale [[advancements_and_limitations_in_artificial_intelligence | AI]] chip production is not a limiting factor, as agricultural equipment requires chips comparable to those in a normal car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Farmers typically only need one of each piece of equipment, eliminating the need for mass fleet deployment to apply these technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

## Disproportionate Benefits

> [!INFO] Historical Context
> Every technological change throughout history has disproportionately benefited certain regions, countries, and individuals more than others, a trend that is not expected to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

These emerging technologies in agriculture tend to disproportionately benefit First World countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. To fully benefit from the agricultural situation, access to significant row crop areas is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. Given that the United States possesses the largest number of skilled 20 and 30-somethings and the most capital, even in this new era shaped by [[global_demographic_shifts_and_future_economic_implications | demographic shifts]], these agricultural innovations are expected to have their primary impact there first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

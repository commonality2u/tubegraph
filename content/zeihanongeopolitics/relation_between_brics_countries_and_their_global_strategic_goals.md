The BRICS grouping, initially comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, was not founded by its members but rather conceived by a finance professional seeking large bond markets [00:53]. South Africa was admitted later [01:11]. The group has struggled with internal cohesion and a lack of shared strategic goals [01:16].

## Original BRICS Members' Individual Goals

Despite the formation of a Development Bank, over 90% of its capital comes from China [01:20]. Trade between most BRICS members, aside from their exports to China, is minimal [01:28].

*   **China**
    *   Views BRICS primarily as a rhetorical vehicle and aims to leverage it to gain trade concessions from Washington [02:51].
    *   Does not care about the other member countries beyond their utility for Chinese interests [02:58].
    *   Its goals are described as "very nationalist, very almost hateful domineering" [11:57].
    *   Chinese President Xi Jinping notably did not attend some opening ceremonies of the summit, suggesting a lack of perceived utility [12:23].
*   **Russia**
    *   Wants all members to boycott the West until its demands regarding Ukraine are met, while retaining its own freedom to trade [02:35].
    *   Believes everyone should use the ruble [02:02].
    *   Its economic system is considered "kind of by itself" [06:08].
*   **India**
    *   Traditionally a non-aligned power, India is increasingly "edging towards being in the American Camp" due to China's assertive behavior [03:02].
    *   India still maintains a "lingering love of the [[non_aligned_movement | non-aligned movement]]" [10:16].
*   **Brazil**
    *   Described as having a "La Dee Da" foreign policy, particularly on economic matters [02:10].
    *   Is seeking new financial access points, hoping to secure Chinese money without having to repay debts [09:31].
*   **South Africa**
    *   As the host of the summit, South Africa adopted a stance of neutrality [03:19].

## Lack of Cohesion and Divergent Interests

Historically, BRICS has failed to produce any meaningful agreements [01:18]. Discussions about forming a new global currency to challenge the dollar frequently fall apart when details are discussed [01:46]. India, China, South Africa, and the BRICS-owned bank have explicitly stated they are not interested in a global currency [01:54]. Only Russia and Brazil have shown interest in such an idea [02:01].

The interests of the countries attending the BRICS summit are "far more diverse" than those of the non-aligned movement in the early post-colonial era [04:31]. This diversity makes reaching consensus difficult [04:52].

## Expansion and Its Implications

The BRICS summit decided to [[expansion_of_brics_and_potential_implications | expand its membership]] to include six new countries: Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Ethiopia, and Argentina [05:07]. This expansion is seen as indicating that BRICS has "no plans of doing anything useful in the future" [05:13].

### New Members' Strategic Positions

*   **Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates (UAE)**
    *   Their primary motivation for considering non-US dollar transactions for oil is to secure security gear and involvement in security planning due to fears of the [[shift_in_us_global_strategic_role | United States]] withdrawing from the region [06:19].
    *   Their historical use of the US dollar was based on a bilateral security relationship with the US, not a caucus group like BRICS [07:02].
    *   Currently, they are engaged in trilateral negotiations with the Americans and Israelis, seeking a Japan-style security guarantee from the US [07:25].
    *   They prioritize security over currency, as China "lacks the capacity to deploy at range" in a way that would satisfy their security needs, especially given their concern about Iran [07:43].
*   **Iran**
    *   Has "firm opinions about security issues," specifically believing it should be in charge of the Middle East [08:14].
    *   Its inclusion in BRICS necessitated the simultaneous addition of Saudi Arabia and the UAE to prevent Iran from vetoing their future membership [08:21].
*   **Consequences of Middle Eastern Additions**
    *   The inclusion of diametrically opposed powers like Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE guarantees that BRICS will "never have a meaningful energy policy" due to their conflicting positions on significant issues [08:35].
*   **Ethiopia**
    *   Brings "very little to the table" economically, being one of the world's ten poorest countries per capita and landlocked [09:02].
    *   It is not part of China's "One Belt One Road" initiative because China sees no investment case there [09:09].
    *   Its addition was primarily to bring "African Flair" to the organization [09:17].
*   **Argentina**
    *   Has an "entitlement complex," believing it should receive money without having to repay it [09:27].
    *   Applied for BRICS membership hoping to get Chinese money, as it is "anti-paying back their debts" [09:31].
    *   It is seen as a "drain on the organization" [09:51].
*   **Egypt**
    *   Considered a "US satellite state," as the US financially supports Egypt (and Israel and Jordan) to prevent conflict [09:57].
    *   Its inclusion is attributed to India's appreciation for Egypt's historical political role in the [[non_aligned_movement | non-aligned movement]], rather than its current economic or strategic significance [10:11].

## Future Prospects

The expansion of BRICS is likely to paralyze the organization due to the increased number of differing viewpoints [10:45]. For BRICS to achieve anything meaningful in the midterm, two scenarios are possible:

1.  **China Subsidizes Everything**: China would have to heavily subsidize countries like Argentina and Ethiopia, a strategy that previously "broke the bank" for the Soviet Union in the 1970s [11:01]. This is unlikely as China is not expected to pay for influence in places it cannot control or that offer little benefit [11:18].
2.  **New Non-Aligned Movement**: BRICS could rapidly expand to become a new non-aligned movement [11:29]. However, this differs from the historical movement because China and Russia have clear strategic alignments and goals [11:36]. Most "middle and lesser Powers" are unlikely to follow their lead [11:43]. While many in the Global South have not condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine, this does not mean they wish to follow Russia [11:47]. Similarly, other nations are wary of China's "very nationalist, very almost hateful domineering goals" and do not wish to become pawns [11:55].

Ultimately, the BRICS summit's outcome suggests the organization remains largely a rhetorical vehicle, as evidenced by Xi Jinping's notable absence from key opening ceremonies [12:23].

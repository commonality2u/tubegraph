Canada, described as the most pro-immigration country in the world, has adopted an aggressive immigration strategy to counter a significant demographic decline it faced as recently as 20 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This decline mirrored those seen in countries like Germany, Italy, or Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Canada's Immigration Approach

Unlike other nations facing similar demographic challenges, Canada opted to actively pursue immigration as a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Over approximately 15 years, the country welcomed an estimated 4 million migrants, representing more than 10% of its total population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. A key aspect of this strategy is the age profile of these immigrants: most are under 35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

This contrasts with earlier immigration patterns where many immigrants were older, in their 50s, leading to them being a net liability in terms of taxes paid versus services received for pensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The current wave of younger immigrants is expected to contribute to the system as workers and consumers for decades before becoming a liability, making it "the best of all deals from a demographic point of view" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Furthermore, these individuals have often already completed primary and secondary education, arriving ready to work, spend, and pay taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## [[challenges_posed_by_canadas_immigration_policies | Challenges Posed by Immigration]]

Despite the demographic and economic benefits, Canada's immigration policy has brought [[housing_market_and_social_tension_in_canada | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>:

*   **Housing Costs:** Since immigrants are coming from places they don't intend to return to, they need permanent housing. This demand has significantly driven up housing costs in major gateway cities like Montreal, Vancouver, and Toronto, and has begun affecting secondary cities such as Winnipeg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Social Tension:** The rapid changes have created social tension that previously didn't exist in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. While not as extreme as the nativist sentiments seen in other parts of the world, it is a notable development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Impact on Internal Income Imbalance

Historically, Canada faced an income imbalance where only Alberta effectively subsidized other provinces, which were aging towards mass retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The traditional compact relied on Ontario taxpayers funding Quebec to prevent secession, but this became unsustainable as Ontarians began hitting mass retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

The recent immigration surge has brought more people to British Columbia, Ontario, and to a lesser extent, Quebec <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This increased tax base has provided the Canadian state with "a lot of wiggle room" to manage its internal financial disparities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This can be viewed as "geopolitical Novocaine" for Canada's internal imbalances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

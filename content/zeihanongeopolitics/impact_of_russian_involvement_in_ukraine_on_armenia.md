Armenia, a post-Soviet republic, has historically relied on Russia as its security guarantor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This backing enabled Armenia to achieve significant military gains against Azerbaijan in the 1990s, occupying over a fifth of Azerbaijani territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. However, Russia's deep involvement in the [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Ukraine conflict]] has profoundly impacted this dynamic.

## Weakening of Russian Support

The [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Ukraine conflict]] has caused Russia to steadily pull troops from other operations globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This includes:
*   Withdrawal of African troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   Relocation of forces from NATO borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   Return of other troops from the Caucasus region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

Concerns exist regarding the current state of Russian forces in Armenia, questioning their ability to fight, the presence of their equipment, and Russia's capacity to engage in a second military conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Furthermore, Russian forces lack a direct land connection to Armenia, needing to pass through Georgia or Azerbaijan, both of whom might now oppose such transit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Armenian Vulnerability

Azerbaijan has taken advantage of the shifting geopolitical landscape. After acquiring Turkish combat drones, Azerbaijan decisively defeated Armenian forces in a swift conflict approximately two years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. While Azerbaijani ground troops were historically incompetent, they have spent the last year training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This improvement, coupled with Russia's diminished capacity, suggests that if a conflict were to recur, Azerbaijan could advance further and seize more territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Search for New Guarantors

Given Russia's weakened position, Armenia is compelled to seek a new security guarantor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Options are limited:
*   **United States:** This would be a significant shift and likely require Armenia to return territory captured in the 1990s, as Azerbaijan already maintains good relations with the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Turkey:** Turkey is a close ally of Azerbaijan, making it an unlikely guarantor for Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Iran:** Despite religious differences (Iran is Muslim, Armenia is Christian), Iran and Armenia have been de facto allies since the post-Soviet collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Iran and Russia, while not always aligned, generally view Turkey and the US as problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Iran also harbors concerns about an independent Azerbaijan due to its significant Azeri ethnic minority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

The search for new alliances highlights [[potential_geopolitical_alliances_for_armenia | potential geopolitical alliances for Armenia]] that would have been less considered before Russia's entanglement in Ukraine.

## US Politics and Armenia's Dilemma

The [[influence_of_armenian_lobbying_in_us_politics | Armenian Lobby in the United States]] is powerful, having historically secured substantial US aid for Armenia even during its aggressive actions in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. As Armenia explores alternatives, including closer ties with Iran, this will create a clash with the established anti-Iranian lobby in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

Azerbaijan aims to cut the key corridor connecting Armenia and Iran, which would inevitably trigger a response from Tehran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This situation will create complex and potentially "delightfully lively" intersections between US domestic and foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

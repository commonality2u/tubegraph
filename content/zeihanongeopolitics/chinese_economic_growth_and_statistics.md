Recent observations indicate that the [[Chinas economic decline and consumer spending | Chinese economy]] has experienced a significant downturn, moving towards a borderline recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Since the fourth quarter of 2019, with the onset of COVID-19, the [[Challenges in the Chinese economy | Chinese economy]] has largely been in decline, with only minor upticks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. If a forensic audit were conducted on [[Chinas economic strategies and challenges | Chinese books]], it might reveal that the overall [[Chinas economic strategies and challenges | Chinese economy]] has remained roughly the same size since that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Unreliable Statistics

By their own statistics, China is not expected to achieve its 5% GDP growth target for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Private sector observers, who possess a more realistic understanding of the situation, consider official [[Chinas demographic challenges and economic growth | Chinese statistics]] to be "clearly useless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The [[Chinas demographic and economic challenges | Chinese government]] pathologically misrepresents its data, not out of malice, but because the system is structured to encourage exaggeration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This results in inflated data at both local and national levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Government Ideology and Economic Drivers

A significant challenge is that Chairman Xi Jinping's government does not view private consumption as a meaningful driver of [[Economic Growth Models of India and China | economic growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. From an ideological standpoint, the idea of individuals spending on themselves rather than on the state appears alien to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## The Banking Sector Crisis

The method by which capital enters the [[chinese_economic_model_and_government_intervention_limits | Chinese economy]]—through its banks—is described as "completely broken" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The [[Chinas economic strategies and challenges | Chinese approach]] to stimulating economic activity involves pressuring banks to lend broadly at zero to negative real interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. While this can generate initial [[Implications of Chinas demographic data for the economy | economic growth]], its stability or sustainability is highly questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This resembles subprime lending, Enron, or the Savings and Loan crisis in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Non-Performing Loans (NPLs)

In the U.S., if 1.5% of a bank's loans become non-performing (i.e., they go bad), regulators intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Banks typically start to fail when NPLs exceed 2% due to insufficient margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

In China, where loan margins are often zero or negative and fiduciary responsibility is not a well-translated concept, many loans that should not have been made go bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Internal estimates suggest that the total NPL ratio for the entire [[Demographic and economic challenges facing China | Chinese banking sector]] is between 5.5% and 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This effectively means that, on average, the entire [[Demographic and economic challenges facing China | Chinese banking sector]] is in a state of crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

*   **Regional Disparity**: Banks located in coastal regions tend to operate more prudently due to foreign investment and export involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. However, in the interior, particularly in poorer agricultural areas, local and regional state banks face greater instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Ineffective Stimulus Measures

Recent stimulus measures, such as slightly lowering mortgage rates and reducing the reserve requirement (the percentage of deposits banks must hold back), are considered only mildly stimulatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. These measures do not address the core issue: China's declining working-age population (few people under 50), which limits the consumption base that can be stimulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Outlook

For [[Chinas economic strategies and challenges | Chinese economic growth]] to improve, banks must be put in a position to function normally, which requires disposing of the massive non-performing loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. In the U.S., such a cleanup has historically followed financial sector-linked recessions, like the subprime crisis (2007-2009) or the Savings and Loan crisis (1980s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

China faces a situation that is at least an order of magnitude worse, and even more severe when considering the relative strength of the U.S. economy compared to China's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. While the [[Chinas Economic Decline and Consumer Spending | Chinese stock market]] may experience temporary upticks, none of the underlying issues have been resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Making credit easier when it is already overextended will only exacerbate the inevitable economic downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

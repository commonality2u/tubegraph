China has experienced a series of purges within its military structure, a phenomenon that has raised questions about the country's military effectiveness and governance under [[centralized_power_in_china_under_xi_jinping | Xi Jinping]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. These purges extend beyond technical military aspects to the leadership, functional, and structural elements of the armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Command Structure in China

Unlike the United States, where the Defense Secretary has formal command of forces and reports directly to the President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, China's Defense Ministry does not possess operational control over the military or policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The Chinese Defense Ministry primarily functions as a "glorified press secretary" handling military diplomacy and acting as an interface with foreign counterparts, but without real decision-making authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The actual decision-makers reside on the Central Military Commission (CMC), which is chaired by [[centralized_power_in_china_under_xi_jinping | Xi Jinping]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Overview of the Purges

The Chinese government has been conducting a series of purges for approximately 14 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. These purges have been robust, designed to allow [[centralized_power_in_china_under_xi_jinping | Xi]] to tighten his grip on all aspects of governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Targeting Corruption and Political Competition
From [[centralized_power_in_china_under_xi_jinping | Xi's]] perspective, when he assumed power, China was characterized by widespread corruption and was structurally decentralized, despite the Chinese Communist Party's desire for centralized decision-making through Beijing and ultimately through [[centralized_power_in_china_under_xi_jinping | Xi]] himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. To counter this, [[centralized_power_in_china_under_xi_jinping | Xi]] initiated purges to address both corruption and perceived political competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

Over 12 years, this process has effectively "gutted the system" of individuals who might oppose him, including those in local and state government, academia, business, and the federal bureaucracy. These purges have reportedly removed individuals with ambition and competence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Recent Military Purges
The military was initially excluded from earlier purges due to its armed nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. However, [[xi_jinpings_influence_on_the_chinese_military | Xi]] has now begun to target the military leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Recent military purges have aimed at political players or those guilty of corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

Notable incidents include:
*   The former defense secretary was purged over the summer of 2023, vanishing for two months before his formal removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   Admiral Dong Jun was appointed as the new defense minister in late 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   In a span of a few months, 20 top-level military personnel were fired, with 12 of these dismissals occurring within just two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This includes a recently appointed defense minister, who was chosen by [[centralized_power_in_china_under_xi_jinping | Xi]] himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## [[impact_of_political_purges_on_chinese_military_effectiveness | Impact on Military Effectiveness]]

The purges have led to the Central Military Commission (CMC), responsible for military planning, being "stacked" with "incompetent yes-men" or individuals who avoid saying anything at all to avoid bothering [[centralized_power_in_china_under_xi_jinping | Xi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. [[xi_jinpings_influence_on_the_chinese_military | Xi]] is imposing the same structural "gutting" on the military that has been seen in other sectors of the Chinese bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

This has resulted in a bureaucracy that struggles to function, as individuals are hesitant to transmit information due to uncertainty about [[centralized_power_in_china_under_xi_jinping | Xi's]] reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. The military is now experiencing similar issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

Historically, China's military preparedness and capability were constrained by a lack of expertise and significant corruption, comparable to Russian-style misappropriation of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. If [[centralized_power_in_china_under_xi_jinping | Xi]] achieves his aims, a significant portion of military personnel's time could be spent studying texts written by and about [[centralized_power_in_china_under_xi_jinping | Xi Jinping]], rather than focusing on military duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. The long-term effects of this on military effectiveness remain to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

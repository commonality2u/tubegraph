A severe oil price crash due to conflict in the [[middle_east_geopolitics_and_oil_reliance | Middle East]] is now a distinct possibility, a scenario previously considered unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Historical Context and Shifting Circumstances
Previously, the idea of Iran closing the [[impact_of_geopolitical_tensions_on_shipping_routes | Strait of Hormuz]] and oil prices skyrocketing was considered unrealistic, as all of Iran's crude exports pass through this strait, meaning Iran would be harming itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. However, the circumstances have changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### The Next Gulf War Scenario
In the speaker's book, published about ten years ago, he outlined three "Wars of the Deglobalization Period," conflicts arising as the U.S. steps back from global security, leading countries to act out of opportunity or desperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. One of these is the "Next Gulf War," a conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This scenario envisions a situation where they cannot reliably export energy, leading them to attack each other's oil infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This conflict could put 10 to 12 million barrels of crude at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

The situation has become more imminent following Iran's missile launch at Israel and Israel's clear intent to retaliate, specifically shortlisting Iran's oil sector as potential targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Targeted Disruption of Oil Exports

### Iran's Vulnerable Oil Sector
The most obvious target for Israeli retaliation is Iran's Kharg Island, which is the only meaningful export point for Iranian crude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This island, with its subsea pipeline infrastructure connecting to the mainland and offshore loading platforms, is critical for Iran's oil exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Israel has demonstrated the ability to neutralize any air defense system in Iran, as shown by their strike on air defenses near Iran's nuclear program in Isfahan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. A few Israeli sorties could devastate Iran's entire oil export capacity within an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### Escalation and Broader Regional Impacts
If Iran's oil export capacity is destroyed, Iran would have little to lose and would likely, out of desperation, try to take out Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This could involve:
*   **Military Invasion:** A military invasion crossing into Iraq and Kuwait to seize oil fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Missile Attacks:** Iran possesses enough missiles to target oil export and processing facilities on the western side of the Persian Gulf, especially in Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Most of Saudi Arabia's crude originates from the Ghawar region near the coast, with loading platforms on the Gulf Coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

While a disruption of only Iranian crude (around 1 million barrels a day) would not be globally significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, including other Gulf states, notably Saudi Arabia, could lead to a reduction of 10 million barrels or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. If Iraq, UAE, or Kuwait are also affected, the total could reach 20 million barrels a day, driving oil prices above $300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## Disparate Global and Regional Economic Consequences

In such a scenario, the current single global oil price system would shatter, leading to varied outcomes across different regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### United States
*   **Domestic Market Saturation:** In 2015, the U.S. Congress granted the presidency the authority to summarily end all American crude oil exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. With the U.S. Shale Revolution yielding several million barrels a day, a president facing surging oil prices could halt exports, creating a super-saturated market within the U.S <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Price Disparity:** This would result in a functional price ceiling of $60-$70 per barrel in the U.S., while the rest of the world would face a functional floor of $200-$300 per barrel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Economic Outcome:** The U.S. might "skate right on" economically, while the rest of the world experiences a [[global_and_regional_economic_consequences_of_an_oil_disruption | global depression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **California Exception:** California, lacking pipeline connections to other U.S. oil fields and importing most of its crude from the Persian Gulf, would face significantly higher prices, potentially $10 per gallon for gasoline, creating an economic schism within the U.S <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

### China
[[potential_consequences_for_chinas_economy_due_to_oil_supply_disruptions | China]] would suffer the most, as it is the largest consumer of crude from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, and Iranâ€”all sources that would be at risk or completely disrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### Saudi Arabia and UAE
These nations have anticipated such issues and built bypass pipelines that circumvent the [[impact_of_geopolitical_tensions_on_shipping_routes | Strait of Hormuz]] entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This allows roughly 5 to 6.5 million barrels per day to still be exported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. If Saudi oil prices triple but exports are halved, they could be in a net financial superior position, assuming they are not conquered by Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Probability
> The likelihood of this severe disruption occurring in the next few months is estimated to be between 1 in 4 and 1 in 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

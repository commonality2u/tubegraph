While there is no direct indication of [[russian_military_strategies_and_advancements_in_ukraine | Russian involvement]] in the recent Hamas attack on Israel, several aspects suggest a potential indirect connection or influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

## Familiar Tactics

The tactics employed by Hamas, including sharing footage of attacks on civilian targets, are noted as "very familiar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:53">[01:52:53]</a>. Under normal circumstances, attacking civilian targets would be considered a war crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

## Ties to Moscow

The senior leadership of Hamas has reportedly been in and out of Moscow frequently over the past year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. This ongoing contact may indicate a changing political dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

## Israeli-Russian Relations

Israel has maintained open lines of communication with the [[russian_military_strategies_and_advancements_in_ukraine | Russians]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. This stance is partly due to Israel having a population that is approximately one-sixth Russian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>, influencing their cautious approach to avoid deep involvement in the [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Russian invasion]] of Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. This strategic decision also allows Israel to manipulate events in the Arab world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. It remains to be seen if recent events will alter Israel's mindset regarding this relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

## Ukrainian Support for Israel

In contrast to Israel's neutrality regarding the [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Russian invasion]] of Ukraine, the Ukrainian government quickly offered its support to Israel in defending against the Hamas assault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. Ukraine had previously expressed annoyance with Israel's attempt to remain neutral on the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

Iran is actively providing foreign assistance to [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Russia]] in the [[shift_in_ukraine_war_dynamics | Ukraine War]], primarily through the supply of Shahed drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Over 1,000 of these drones have reportedly been used by Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

## Nature of Involvement
Similar to [[north_korean_involvement_in_the_ukraine_war | North Korea]], Iran is not considered a technological leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The number of personnel capable of assembling these drones is relatively limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Russia's dependence on Iran for a substantial percentage of its drone warfare indicates a poor long-term outlook for Russia's ability to sustain the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This reliance suggests [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_Ukraine_war | Russia]] may become wholly dependent on weapon imports, creating opportunities for other countries to impede the [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_Ukraine_war | Russian war machine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

## Intelligence and Strategic Implications
The involvement of Iran in the Ukraine conflict presents an intelligence opportunity to gain information on the system's inner workings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

Iran recently launched hundreds of ballistic missiles against Israel, which is "itching to respond" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. The Biden Administration has reportedly given a "green light" for an Israeli retaliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. With both [[north_korean_involvement_in_the_ukraine_war | North Korea]] and Iran intervening in the Ukraine War, an opportunity exists for the US to influence an Israeli response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This could involve adding target coordinates for facilities that manufacture Shahed drones during an Israeli retaliatory strike on Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Such an action could remove a significant source of military capability for the [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Russians]] in the [[shift_in_ukraine_war_dynamics | Ukraine War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Additionally, Israel could easily expand its target set to include Iranian drone technicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

The involvement of Iran has led to [[shift_in_ukraine_war_dynamics | a shift in Ukraine War dynamics]], bringing countries like Israel and South Korea into the conflict, despite their previous efforts to avoid it due to their own regional security concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

China is currently experiencing a "triple economic funk," facing significant economic challenges that bear resemblance to the deflationary period experienced by Japan. This situation is unfolding as the data finally aligns with long-standing demographic and geopolitical trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

## China's Current Economic Challenges

China has not fully recovered from the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, unlike many other countries that saw an explosion in consumption post-lockdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. In China, growth is lower than during the lockdowns of the past two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, and [[chinas_economic_decline_and_consumer_spending | consumption is down]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Both imports and exports dropped by double digits in July compared to the previous year, a severity typically seen only in war-torn countries like Ukraine or Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

Underlying these [[chinas_postcovid_economic_challenges | post-COVID challenges]] is a [[chinas_demographic_challenges_and_economic_growth | demographic bomb]] that predates the pandemic, with negative demographic trends appearing as early as 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. From 2017 to 2021, China's birth rate fell by approximately 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Signs of this issue were evident even before COVID-19, with new car sales—a key indicator of consumer confidence and future spending—going negative and never recovering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Due to the one-child policy, which is now over 40 years old, China has a missing generation of consumers in their 20s and 30s, the age group typically responsible for significant consumption like buying cars, raising children, and building homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Deflationary Trends in China

Unlike most other developed and developing nations that experienced a burst of inflation post-COVID due to renewed consumption, China's consumption boom never materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Instead, [[deflationary_trends_in_china | deflation]] has emerged as a major concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This is primarily because:
*   People are less confident in their future, leading to reduced consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   Mounting trade wars with Europe, Japan, the United States, and increasingly secondary states like South Korea, have reduced China's export markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   This has resulted in an oversupply of goods locked within the Chinese system, coupled with under-demand both domestically and internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   With excess goods and insufficient demand, prices fall, leading to deflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

While short bursts of deflation are not inherently problematic, the current situation in China aligns with the beginning of a deflationary spiral caused by a fundamental mismatch between supply and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This mismatch is exacerbated by deglobalization and [[chinas_demographic_challenges_and_economic_growth | China's demographic trends]], which are now "well past the point of no return" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

## Comparison with Japan's Deflation

The last country to face a major deflationary burst was Japan, starting in the late 1990s and lasting for 20 to 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Once prices begin to drop due to a supply-demand mismatch, it becomes "devilishly hard to adjust" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Traditional solutions involve reducing supply (which leads to job losses and further reduced spending) or increasing demand through government stimulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

### China's Economic Model and Challenges

[[chinas_economic_strategies_and_challenges | China's economic system]] is primarily based on investment, where the state fosters massive borrowing to build industrial plants and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This investment accounts for 40% to 70% of the entire Chinese economy and has driven most of its economic growth for 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. However, China has reached a point where it no longer needs more bridges or factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. The efficiency of spending — the amount of growth generated per Yuan spent — has been steadily dropping for 40 years and is now less than one-to-one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. More government spending is unlikely to help, as it will not generate more economic activity than its cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. This parallels Japan's situation in the late 1990s and early 2000s, where their economic model ceased to be effective, leading to negative returns on investments and decades of deflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### Japan's Advantages vs. China's Disadvantages

Japan had several advantages when it entered its deflationary period:
*   An existing global supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   Global allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   The option to offshore some manufacturing incrementally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   Strong demand from the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   A positive political relationship with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   Most importantly, Japan was "already rich" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

In stark [[comparison_with_japan_and_koreas_economic_growth | contrast]], China is facing an aging population and entering a permanent recession and deflationary spiral long before it has become rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. The average Chinese citizen's income today, in inflation-indexed terms, is only about a quarter or a fifth of what the average Japanese citizen's income was in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## Outlook for China

If the current [[deflationary_trends_in_china | deflationary trend]] is not a mere blip but the actual story, the situation is expected to worsen significantly in a relatively short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Years of compressed economic damage are now emerging simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Furthermore, China's political system, characterized by a one-man cult of personality, severely limits the state's capacity to devise creative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Even in Japan, where public discourse on these issues was possible, it took a generation to recover, aided by alliances which China lacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

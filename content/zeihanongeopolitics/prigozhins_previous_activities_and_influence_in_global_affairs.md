## Rise to Prominence
[[the_death_of_wagner_group_leader_Yevgeny_Prigozhin | Prigozhin]] initially came to [[Vladimir Putins involvement and potential motive | Putin's]] attention as a caterer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. His ability to articulate strong opinions resonated with [[Vladimir Putins involvement and potential motive | Putin]], leading to direct interactions, financial backing, and state contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. This relationship ultimately facilitated the creation of the [[the_death_of_wagner_group_leader_Yevgeny_Prigozhin | Wagner military group]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. He was relied upon by [[Vladimir Putins involvement and potential motive | Putin]] for "unsavory things" over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.

## Involvement in Conflicts
[[the_death_of_wagner_group_leader_Yevgeny_Prigozhin | Prigozhin]] and the [[the_death_of_wagner_group_leader_Yevgeny_Prigozhin | Wagner Group]] played a brutal role in the war in [[international_implications_and_reactions_to_Prigozhins_death | Ukraine]]:
*   **Bakhmut Assault** [[the_death_of_wagner_group_leader_Yevgeny_Prigozhin | Prigozhin]] directed a "meat grinder assault" in the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. This operation resulted in the deaths of a minimum of 30,000 Russian soldiers, with some estimates suggesting the number could be as high as 100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. Many Ukrainians were also killed during the Bakhmut siege <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.
*   **Crimea War (2014)** [[the_death_of_wagner_group_leader_Yevgeny_Prigozhin | Prigozhin]] was involved in the "little green men" incidents during the original Crimea War in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.

## Global Influence Operations
Beyond military actions, [[the_death_of_wagner_group_leader_Yevgeny_Prigozhin | Prigozhin]] extended his influence through various means:
*   **"Troll Factory"** He founded the infamous "troll factory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.
*   **US Election Interference** [[the_death_of_wagner_group_leader_Yevgeny_Prigozhin | Prigozhin]] openly and publicly bragged about interfering in the [[russian_influence_on_global_political_dynamics_and_US_response | American presidential election]] between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

## Post-Coup Relocation
Following the attempted [[Pergozins influence and the attempted coup | coup]] in Russia, [[the_death_of_wagner_group_leader_Yevgeny_Prigozhin | Prigozhin]] and [[the_death_of_wagner_group_leader_Yevgeny_Prigozhin | Wagner]] were slated to relocate to [[international_implications_and_reactions_to_Prigozhins_death | Belarus]] as part of a deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. However, they chose to settle directly on the Polish border, causing nervousness in Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. The deal was supposedly brokered by Belarusian President Lukashenka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

## Internal Dynamics and Enemies
Given his expansive and often ruthless activities, [[the_death_of_wagner_group_leader_Yevgeny_Prigozhin | Prigozhin]] accumulated a long list of potential enemies, both within [[Vladimir Putins governance style and background | Putin's inner circle]] and globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>:
*   **[[Vladimir Putins involvement and potential motive | Vladimir Putin]]** [[the_death_of_wagner_group_leader_Yevgeny_Prigozhin | Prigozhin's]] public insults against the Russian military-industrial complex during the [[Pergozins influence and the attempted coup | coup]] attempt led [[Vladimir Putins involvement and potential motive | Putin]] to feel a strong motivation to "snip" him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
*   **Military-Industrial Complex** [[the_death_of_wagner_group_leader_Yevgeny_Prigozhin | Prigozhin]] angered the military proper, which is not part of [[Vladimir Putins involvement and potential motive | Putin's]] political coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.
*   **[[Russias organized crime and government connections | Organized Crime]] and [[Vladimir Putins governance style and background | Putin's Inner Circle]]** Many individuals in [[Vladimir Putins governance style and background | Putin's inner circle]] and [[Russias organized crime and government connections | organized crime]] wished [[the_death_of_wagner_group_leader_Yevgeny_Prigozhin | Prigozhin]] dead, either due to being wronged by him or viewing him as a stepping stone to gain more influence with [[Vladimir Putins involvement and potential motive | Putin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.
*   **Ukrainians** For obvious reasons, Ukrainians had cause to want him dead, given the number of lives he took in their country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.
*   **Poles** The Poles were nervous due to [[the_death_of_wagner_group_leader_Yevgeny_Prigozhin | Prigozhin's]] relocation to the Belarusian-Polish border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.
*   **Belarusian President Lukashenka** As the mediator of the post-[[Pergozins influence and the attempted coup | coup]] deal, Lukashenka could have been involved, as deals in the former Soviet world often do not hold until someone is dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.
*   **Americans** Due to his role in interfering with the [[russian_influence_on_global_political_dynamics_and_US_response | American presidential election]], many Americans would have liked to see him eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

Regardless of the perpetrator, [[the_death_of_wagner_group_leader_Yevgeny_Prigozhin | Prigozhin's]] death creates an opening in [[Vladimir Putins governance style and background | Putin's inner circle]] for someone to fill the vital role of providing plausible deniability for the [[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russian state's]] unsavory actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

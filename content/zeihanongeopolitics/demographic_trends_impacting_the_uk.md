The United Kingdom finds itself at a pivotal moment in its post-American series, facing significant decisions partly influenced by its demographic situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

## Demographics Compared to the European Union

The [[European demographic trends and economic impacts | European Union]] is described as being on its "final legs" demographically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. Major powers within the EU, specifically [[Demographic challenges facing Germany | Germany]] and [[European demographic trends and economic impacts | Italy]], are projected to age into obsolescence within a decade, with most other EU countries following within two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

While the UK's demography is not considered "super healthy," it is noted as the second healthiest within the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

## Brexit and Demographic Considerations

The comparative demographic health of the UK played a role in the conversation surrounding Brexit, which began about a decade prior to the discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. The idea was to "get a jump on what's next" and leave the "sinking ship" that represents the economic aspect of the [[European demographic trends and economic impacts | European Union]], which made some sense from an economic perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

## Future Economic Choices Influenced by Demographics

Seven years after Brexit, the UK is still determining its future policy and has two primary choices, both with significant demographic implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>:

### Option 1: Seek a New "Empire"
One option is for the UK to find a new "Empire" by forming a series of trade deals with countries that possess [[Demographic shifts and economic implications | young demographics]] capable of supplying raw materials and other necessities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. However, this differs significantly from its historical imperial era, where the UK leveraged an industrial advantage to dominate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. The current global landscape makes it difficult for a mid-sized power like the UK to become the center of a global trade network without the ability to force its preeminence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

### Option 2: Partner with the United States
The second option is to partner with a single, large, wealthy country that has [[Impact of Demographics on Economic Future | better demographic structures]] and shares the UK's security concerns about a united Eurasia as a military power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. The United States is identified as the only country that fulfills these criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. Such a partnership would require the UK to accede to US demands across various sectors, potentially including agriculture, finance, and manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. While this would result in a significant economic and emotional blow to the UK, it is considered the most functional long-term solution for economic stability and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. It is anticipated that the UK will eventually accept this reality, becoming a subsidiary of the American system, thereby losing its agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.

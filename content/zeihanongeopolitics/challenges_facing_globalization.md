The United States is increasingly moving away from its long-standing role of patrolling global oceans, a shift expected to significantly alter the international economic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This engagement, initially undertaken not for America's direct benefit but for strategic alliances, is now winding down, presenting new [[challenges_in_global_maritime_shipping | challenges in global maritime shipping]] and trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Historical Context: The Post-War Global Network

Following World War II, the United States found itself facing the Soviet Union, outnumbered and geographically disadvantaged with much of Western Europe devastated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. To counter the very real threat of Soviet expansion, the U.S. needed a way to encourage other nations to align with it and physically position themselves between American forces and the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

The solution was a grand inducement: global trade and [[globalization_ending_and_regional_strategies | globalization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The U.S. Navy was deployed to patrol the global oceans, ensuring that anyone could trade with anyone at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Furthermore, the American market, which was the only major economy to survive the war intact, was opened to global exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. At that time, the U.S. consumer market was roughly the size of the rest of the world combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This framework created the global economic system known today, with a global GDP of approximately $90 to $100 trillion, of which one-quarter to one-third relies on international exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This entire system would not have been possible without the American presence patrolling the oceans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Even after 30 years of other nations building navies, the U.S. Navy remains at least seven times more powerful than every other navy combined, excluding close allies like the British and Japanese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

The U.S. itself has a largely continental economic system, with significant international trade integration with Mexico and Canada only starting in 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The primary beneficiaries of this global trade setup have been Germany, facing economic challenges due to demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, and [[challenges_facing_chinas_future | China]], which envisions itself as a global superpower but lacks a global navy, a consumption-led system, or strong alliances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Current Shifts and [[reasons_for_deglobalization_momentum | Reasons for Deglobalization Momentum]]

For over a decade, the United States has been gradually withdrawing from its role in maintaining this global system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This has led to incremental shifts in foreign policy, making the U.S. less inclined to protect assets like oil tankers or shipments originating from the Russian space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. These are areas where countries benefit from American protection without providing reciprocal security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. As allies face demographic breakdowns, the economic case for [[globalization_ending_and_regional_strategies | globalization]] weakens, and the security rationale has largely disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### The Persian Gulf Example

The Persian Gulf, crucial for maritime shipping, illustrates this shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. While the U.S. has historically sourced most of its energy from the Western Hemisphere and is now net independent, crude oil from the Persian Gulf primarily flowed to the U.S. alliance network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. More recently, especially since the Russia-Ukraine conflict, most of this crude has been directed to [[challenges_facing_chinas_future | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Consequently, the strategic rationale for the U.S. to keep these sea lanes open has diminished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

This policy change has become evident:
*   The Iranians have confiscated or hijacked several oil tankers without intervention from the U.S. Navy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   Previously, the U.S. maintained a significant presence, often one or two Nimitz supercarriers in the Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   Now, after years without a meaningful presence, the U.S. deploys a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) – a carrier with 2,000 Marines – to reassure allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. While an MEU is formidable, it represents only about one-sixth the firepower of a supercarrier, signaling a significantly reduced commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. The era of constant, robust U.S. naval presence in Bahrain is over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## Impact on Global Supply Chains

The withdrawal of U.S. protection could manifest in various ways, with Russia potentially being a catalyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. As Russia intensifies its actions in Ukraine, including targeting agricultural systems and shipping confiscated grain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, the U.S. may implicitly or explicitly remove its cover for Russian maritime shipments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Once an incident occurs with a Russian ship—whether piracy or state seizure—global insurance rates will dramatically increase as it becomes clear the U.S. Navy is no longer universally providing security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

Even minor disruptions can cripple supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>:
*   Most manufacturing, particularly for goods below the complexity of cell phones or computers, operates on margins of less than three percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   These products often involve a dozen or more countries spanning the Asian rim and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   Any interruption in these steps, especially for components with minimal margins, can cause the entire product chain to collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   In the era of containerized shipping, where thousands of containers hold hundreds of thousands of components, even small disruptions can break down entire economic models, particularly in East Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

## Conclusion

The end of pervasive U.S. global security for maritime trade signals a precarious future for businesses with complex, "gangly" supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Companies are advised to make plans to adapt, as the time to build new, more localized supply chains may be running out, particularly with North American labor largely spoken for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

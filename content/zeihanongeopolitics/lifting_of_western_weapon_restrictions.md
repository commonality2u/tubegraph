The balance of power in the Ukraine war has seen its most significant shift in at least the last year, primarily due to the lifting of restrictions on Western weapons use on Russian soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Background to the Shift

Two key cities are central to this development: Belgorod in Russia, a significant logistical hub and population center, and Kharkiv in Ukraine, the second or third most populous city in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Early in the conflict, forces from Belgorod launched a major assault on Kharkiv, nearly capturing it before Ukrainian counter-offensives pushed them back to the border a year into the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

Recently, Russian forces have attempted another offensive, using large numbers of technically outdated T-62 tanks to try and overwhelm Ukrainian defenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Despite facing horrific casualty ratios, estimated between 5 and 6 to 1 against the Ukrainians, Russia possesses sufficient manpower and views sheer numbers as an advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Since the beginning of the war, Russia has relied on the assumption that Western weapons supplied to Ukraine could not be used across the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This allowed Belgorod to serve as a launching point for continuous artillery and missile attacks on Kharkiv, targeting not just military assets but also the city's power grid and logistical hubs, causing significant hardship and casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Ukraine had been advocating for these Western restrictions to be lifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## The Lifting of Restrictions and Immediate Impact

In the last 48 hours, these restrictions have been lifted, specifically for the Kharkiv axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This has allowed Ukraine to target military-significant locations in the Belgorod area, including air defense sites, ammo dumps, fuel depots, and rail yards, rather than just counter-battery fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

This [[changes_in_battlefield_strategies and dynamics | change in battlefield strategy]] has several immediate tactical implications:
*   The Russian forces currently assaulting Kharkiv have committed almost all available resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   Their logistical hub in Belgorod is now being "obliterated," cutting off reinforcements, equipment, ammo, and fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   A significant [[strategic_changes_in_ukrainian_military_tactics | Ukrainian counter-offensive]] is anticipated within days to weeks, aiming to liquidate the Russian forces currently engaged in the Kharkiv assault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Russian troops may be forced to retreat to their border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Broader Strategic Implications

For Ukraine to ultimately succeed, Russia must lose the ability to launch new assaults, and Belgorod has always been a primary military node due to its proximity and role as a logistical and population center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Neutralizing Belgorod is crucial for Ukraine's long-term security as an independent state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. While current attacks may not be enough for complete neutralization without ground forces crossing the border, it is the most Ukraine can achieve at this point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

Another critical logistical hub is Rostov-on-Don, which serves a similar role for the southern and southeastern fronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. However, Rostov-on-Don is significantly further from the front lines than Belgorod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. It is uncertain if Ukraine possesses enough Western weapons with the necessary range to effectively target Rostov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. If Rostov could be neutralized, the Crimean Peninsula would likely fall back under Ukrainian influence as it relies on Rostov for all its supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## Why Now?

The reason for the previous restrictions was the concern among Western nations about Russian retaliation if their weapons were used on Russian soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. However, there has been a recent change in who delivers threats from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Instead of Putin or serious military/intelligence figures, most threats have come from Dimitri Medvedev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Medvedev is seen as a mouthpiece for Putin, used to test increasingly outlandish statements before more serious individuals might articulate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

This observation led Western capitals to conclude that, given the current state of the war, Russia's threats of retaliation were not serious, making it acceptable to lift the restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Future Outlook

With this "seal broken," it is highly probable that Western nations will further liberalize restrictions, allowing Ukraine to target Russian military assets whenever and wherever they are located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. While this may not happen immediately, it is expected by the end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

Additionally, by the end of the year, it is anticipated that some Western troops, notably French forces, will be operating within Ukraine itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. There has been a growing realization in Europe that if the war is to conclude without the seeding of European territory, it must be taken more seriously in terms of finance, equipment, policy, and troop deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. The current developments mark the beginning of this transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

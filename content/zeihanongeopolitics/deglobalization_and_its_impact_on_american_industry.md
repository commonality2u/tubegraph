The United States is currently experiencing a period of [[reasons_for_deglobalization_momentum | deglobalization]], leading to significant changes in American industry and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. This shift is resulting in skyrocketing demand for American employment, capital, and materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Drivers of Current Economic Conditions

Inflation has been a persistent issue, with the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure, ticking up to 2.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. While inflation has come down from a peak of roughly 9% to around 3% as [[impact_of_chinese_collapse_on_global_supply_chains and us_industrial_growth | supply chains]] adapted to post-COVID-19 consumption patterns, it has leveled off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The Federal Reserve's target of 2% inflation is unlikely to be met unless its mandate changes or significant economic shifts occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Capital Availability and Demographics

The availability of capital is undergoing a significant transformation due to demographic shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The Baby Boomer generation, the largest in human history, was the primary source of private capital when they were aged 45 to 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Between roughly 2000 and 2020, most Baby Boomers were in their capital-rich years, leading to the highest capital availability and lowest capital costs ever recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

However, the majority of Baby Boomers have now retired, or will do so by 2030, liquidating their savings into low-velocity investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. The subsequent Generation X is smaller, and Millennials, the next large generation, are not expected to enter their capital-rich period for another 10 to 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. This means there is significantly less free capital available today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Deglobalization's Impact on American Industry

The current period of [[reasons_for_deglobalization_momentum | deglobalization]] is characterized by the United States increasingly disentangling itself from [[global_economic_restructuring_and_its_impacts | global supply chains]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. This process necessitates building a substantial amount of new industrial plant within the U.S <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

This industrial build-out is expensive, drives significant demand, and contributes to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. While this is a form of "productive inflation" as it builds essential industrial infrastructure for future generations, it absorbs much of the available capital and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### Implications for Interest Rates and Capital Costs

Given the sustained demand from this industrial re-shoring and the reduced availability of free capital, the Federal Reserve is unlikely to lower interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Expectations for "higher for longer" interest rates mean that capital costs are expected to remain elevated for the next decade, until a new large capital-generating class (Millennials) enters their prime earning and saving years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Current capital costs, despite recent increases, are considered the cheapest they will be until the mid-2030s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

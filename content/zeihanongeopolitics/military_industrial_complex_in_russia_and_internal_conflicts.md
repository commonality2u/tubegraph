The apparent death of Yevgeny Prigozhin, leader of the Wagner Group, in an August 2023 plane crash in Russia, highlights deep-seated internal conflicts and power dynamics within the Russian state and its military apparatus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Prigozhin's death was considered a high probability outcome given his "life choices and the people he surrounded himself with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>, and many entities may have desired his demise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

## Key Actors and Motives

### Vladimir Putin
At the top of the list of those who might have wanted Prigozhin dead is Russian President Vladimir Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. Putin had relied on Prigozhin for "unsavory things" over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>, including the "meat grinder assault" in Bakhmut, Ukraine, which reportedly killed tens of thousands of [[russian_military_challenges_and_recruitment_issues | Russian soldiers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. Prigozhin's pseudo-coup and public insults towards the entire [[impact_of_equipment_and_manpower_shortages_on_russian_military | military-industrial complex of the Russian Federation]] gave Putin "an axe to grind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

### The Military-Industrial Complex
Prigozhin also angered the military-industrial complex, which is broadly responsible for the execution of the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. A key distinction in Russia is that the military complex and the industrial complex are separate entities, unlike in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.
*   The industrial part, responsible for weapon manufacturing, involves figures like Chemizov, who is part of Putin's inner circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.
*   The insults, however, were primarily directed towards the "military proper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>, which is not part of Putin's core coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

### Putin's Coalition and Organized Crime
Vladimir Putin's primary coalition is composed of former intelligence operatives (from the KGB/FSB) and organized crime figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. Prigozhin, who initially gained Putin's attention as a caterer before securing state contracts and forming the Wagner Group, eventually became a stepping stone for many within this network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. Many within Putin's inner circle and the organized crime world may have wanted Prigozhin dead, either because he "screwed them over" or because he served as a path for others to gain more influence with Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

### External Actors
Beyond Russia's borders, several parties had reasons to see Prigozhin dead:
*   **Ukrainians:** Prigozhin was responsible for killing many Ukrainians during the Bakhmut siege <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.
*   **Poles:** After the pseudo-coup, Prigozhin and Wagner forces were supposed to relocate to Belarus but settled near the Polish border, causing nervousness in Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.
*   **Belarus (Lukashenka):** Belarusian President Lukashenka reportedly brokered the deal between Putin and Prigozhin after the coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. In the "former Soviet world," deals often don't hold "typically until someone is dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.
*   **Americans:** Prigozhin was the founder of the "troll factory" and openly bragged about interfering in the 2016 American presidential election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.

## Implications of Prigozhin's Death
The exact circumstances of Prigozhin's death remain shrouded in mystery, with only eight bodies found from a manifest of ten at the time of reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. However, if he is indeed dead, it signifies the beginning of a new chapter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. His death creates an opening in Putin's inner circle for a new individual to fill a critical role, offering "plausible deniability" for various [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Russian state actions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

Prigozhin was involved in:
*   The "little green men" actions during the original Crimea War in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.
*   Interfering in US elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.
*   Leading operations in a dozen African countries, where he was accused of war crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.

This role is "too important" for the Russian state and the Kremlin to leave empty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. Someone will step forward, and whether that person is a loyalist to Putin or not will have significant implications for the future dynamics within the Russian power structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.

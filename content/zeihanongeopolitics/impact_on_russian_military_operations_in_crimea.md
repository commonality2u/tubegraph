The Ukrainian recapture of Kherson in November 2022 significantly altered the strategic landscape for [[impact_of_logistical_and_infrastructure_damages_on_russian_forces | Russian military operations]] in southern Ukraine and the [[russian_logistics_challenges_in_crimea | Crimean Peninsula]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The withdrawal was necessitated by the Russian inability to adequately supply troops west of the Dnipro River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This logistical challenge, which led to the abandonment of thousands of soldiers and substantial equipment in Kherson, now extends to the entire Southern Front and Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Logistical Vulnerabilities

The primary cause of the Russian logistical predicament is the damage to the Kerch Strait Bridge, which occurred months prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This bridge serves as the sole rail connection between mainland Russia and the entirety of the Southern Front, including the [[russian_logistics_challenges_in_crimea | Crimean Peninsula]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. With rail transport largely offline, the Russian military has been forced to rely on trucks, which are approximately 1/500th as efficient in a war zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. A light rail line to the north has also been interdicted by Ukrainian forces for months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

Current truck traffic for the Southern Front often involves a long detour around the Sea of Azov, a journey two to three times longer than direct routes, costing 100 times more in fuel, and capable of transporting significantly less cargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

There are only three routes into Crimea:
*   **Kerch Strait Bridge** The only rail connection, currently damaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Two Land Connections (Isthmuses)**
    *   One on the eastern side with a bridge, which is expected to be targeted by Ukrainians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
    *   One on the western side, a five-mile-wide narrow isthmus, which is now well within the range of Ukrainian medium-range missiles following the fall of Kherson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Sea Shipments** The only viable deep-water port is Sevastopol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. However, Ukraine has already demonstrated the ability to interdict shipping there using maritime drones and long-range missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. As a result, both military and civilian ships are largely avoiding the port, rendering it "dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Russia has even evacuated completely from the western half of the Black Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

### Partisan Activity

Compounding these challenges is the growing threat of partisan attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Early in the war, javelin missiles primarily targeted Russian trucks, leading to the loss of over two-thirds of their tactical military truck support fleet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Russians have resorted to using civilian vehicles like city buses and Scooby-Doo vans to transport troops, gear, fuel, and artillery shells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. These civilian vehicles are vulnerable even to small arms fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

A partisan campaign near Mariupol has been active since the second month of the war, and this region is now a primary supply line for Russian forces entering Crimea and the Southern Front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This means the most vulnerable vehicles are passing through an area of significant partisan resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## Ukrainian Strategic Advantage

With the fall of Kherson, Ukrainian forces are positioned along the Dnipro River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. While a direct assault across the river from Kherson is unlikely due to destroyed bridges and logistical difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, Ukrainian forces can launch ground assaults from areas further north, such as Dnipro City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This location offers multiple undamaged bridges, allowing for deployment on multiple axes without encountering Russian resistance or bottlenecks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

These ground thrusts would target the logistical supply lines that are now heavily reliant on trucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Potential targets include Melitopol, which is geographically isolated and easy to attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, or Mariupol, which is highly symbolic and now the primary logistical supply point for the many trucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Any successful push south would effectively cut off all Russian forces to the west of that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

## Catastrophic Outlook for Crimea

If Russia does not engage in a "wide-ranging full retreat" from all territory west of Mariupol and Kerch, including Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, and Crimea, it faces a "catastrophic defeat" in the coming months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Without external supply lines for food, fuel, and troops, Crimea's ability to support itself and a large-scale military operation is severely limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

Crimea lacks oil and refineries, and sea shipments are interdicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Furthermore, Crimea relies on the Crimean Canal for 80% of its food production, which sources water from a sluice gate in Kherson Province, now under Ukrainian control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. This means the canal is unlikely to be reactivated, potentially leading to widespread famine by spring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

This combination of logistical denial, partisan attacks, and impending ground thrusts could "utterly destroy any hope the Russians have of having any sort of functional military position anywhere in the peninsula or the southern front" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Russia faces a choice between a humiliating withdrawal or a humiliating military defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Broader War Implications

While the situation in southern Ukraine and Crimea is dire for Russia, it does not signify the end of the entire conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. The Russian occupations of Donetsk and Luhansk provinces are not affected by these specific logistical problems, as they can be directly supported from the Russian mainland by rail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. This means Ukraine will still need to dislodge Russian forces from those areas through conventional means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. The current developments mark "the beginning of the end of what is the easy part of the war for the Ukrainians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

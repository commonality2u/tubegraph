[[turkeys_historical_and_modern_political_influence | Turkey]] has historically been a major world power since splitting from the Mongol hordes in the 1200s and conquering Istanbul [00:00:06]. For centuries, it was an integral part of [[economic_and_military_relationships_in_the_middle_east | Middle Eastern]] and European politics [00:00:26]. However, a "break from history" occurred after their dramatic defeat in World War I, which shattered their political and economic orders, leading them to withdraw inward for most of the 20th century [00:00:35]. With the rise of current president Erdoğan in recent decades, Turkey has begun to re-emerge, discovering a more complex world [00:00:54]. The disintegration of the Ottoman Empire a century ago left scars that still affect the southern Balkans, the Levant, and Mesopotamia [00:01:07]. As the Turks regain influence, they face many decisions regarding their future [00:01:30].

## [[geopolitical_significance_of_turkeys_location | Strategic Importance of Turkey's Geography]]

Istanbul's location on the Golden Horn and the Turkish Straits is strategically crucial [00:01:39]. These straits are the only water access between the Mediterranean (and beyond to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans) and the Black Sea [00:01:42]. From the Black Sea, navigable rivers like the Don, Dnieper, and Dniester reach deep into Ukraine and even the Russian interior, with a canal linking the Don to the Volga, extending access all the way to Moscow [00:01:51]. This makes Istanbul a historical linkage point by water [00:02:06].

By land, routes extend east into Anatolia, connecting to Persia, India, and China, or northwest through the Balkans into Europe via the Danube [00:02:12]. In any scenario where global trade is hindered, Istanbul could become arguably the most economically and strategically important city on the planet [00:02:26].

## [[turkeys_strategic_options_post_american_global_order | Turkey's Re-emergence in a Post-American Order]]

For the past 70 years, the American-created global order made Turkey's unique geography less critical by making global seas safe for all, allowing access to any body of water [00:02:38]. However, as the U.S. incrementally withdraws its guardianship from the waterways, Turkey's importance is growing [00:03:11]. As Turkey re-expands its influence into former imperial territories, it finds that many zones have developed their own opinions, but with few exceptions, these regional actors are not particularly competent or powerful [00:03:21]. No country within "arms reach" of Turkey, with the possible exception of Iran, could stand up to them meaningfully economically, politically, or militarily [00:03:40]. This provides Turkey with "a wonderful buffet of options" [00:03:57]. However, Turkey lacks the power to pursue all options simultaneously, forcing them to make difficult choices [00:04:06].

## Potential Alliances and Conflicts

### Northern Frontier: Russia and Ukraine

Historically, Turkey controlled the mouths of the Dnieper and Dniester rivers, keeping the Russian Empire at bay for a century by using naval forces from Istanbul to disrupt Russian construction when rivers thawed [00:04:24]. In the ongoing Ukraine war, while Turkey maintains political and economic neutrality, it strategically supports Ukraine [00:04:52]. They provide drones to Ukrainians, knowing that if Ukraine wins, Turkey is the natural and largest beneficiary of a Russian defeat and disintegration [00:05:01].

### Northeastern Frontier: The Caucasus and Azerbaijan

The Caucasus region is often where empires meet their end [00:05:17]. However, it presents opportunities, especially in the Industrial Age [00:05:28]. Azerbaijan, a significant oil producer (about 1 million barrels a day), flows its oil through the Caucasus to Turkey, either via a pipeline to the super-port of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean or through the Black Sea, requiring transit through Istanbul [00:05:31]. Regardless of regional outcomes, Turkey's participation is essential for tapping these riches [00:05:55].

Azerbaijan's people are ethnically Turkic and have historically allied with Turkey [00:06:07]. Following the destruction of the [[potential_geopolitical_alliances_for_armenia | Armenian]] military in 2023, Azerbaijan reconquered lost territory and is now on a "war path" [00:06:23]. The future of the [[potential_geopolitical_alliances_for_armenia | Armenian]] state is uncertain, and Turkey is seen as the primary potential broker for a deal [00:06:36].

### Eastern Frontier: Iran

Going straight east leads to Iran, specifically Iranian Azerbaijan, which shares an ethnic group with independent Azerbaijan [00:06:55]. Iran has always been nervous about an independent Azerbaijan on its doorstep due to a larger Azeri population within Iran [00:07:00]. These Iranian Azeris are also ethnic kin to Turkey [00:07:09]. Turkey could potentially engage in a "serious slam dunk fest" against Iran's military, which is described as "barely trained infantry," given Turkey's "one of the best" military forces [00:07:16]. However, this mountainous zone would require a "serious commitment" from Turkey, potentially preventing other actions [00:07:32].

### Southeastern Frontier: Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf

Moving southeast into Mesopotamia, Turkey encounters the Kurds, a minority group present in Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria [00:07:44]. This region is rich in oil, gas, and some wheat [00:07:54]. Access to the Persian Gulf from this direction would make Turkey a player in the world's largest free energy market at a time when American protection of global energy is declining [00:08:00]. This would allow Turkey to act as a broker in various capacities [00:08:12].

### Southern Frontier: The Levant and Israel

Directly south, Turkey faces the Levant, where Israel is located [00:08:16]. During the first half of the Cold War (until about 1979), Israel and Turkey were close allies, even alongside Iran [00:08:17]. This alliance persisted after Iran's shift until Erdoğan's rise [00:08:29]. Erdoğan's dislike for Israel is mutual [00:08:34]. Erdoğan draws on a page from Turkish history where the Ottoman Turks were not only an economic, political, and military superpower but also religious leaders, with Islam itself centered in Istanbul for a period [00:08:40]. From this perspective, the idea of primarily Western European Jews "oppressing Palestinians who are Arabs and Muslim" is seen as problematic [00:08:57].

A direct conflict with Israel would necessitate Turkey invading all of Syria and Lebanon first, a "mess" nobody desires [00:09:09]. It's more likely that they will "glare at each other" [00:09:18]. A more strategic move would be for Turkey and Israel to cooperate, as they could then easily keep other powers out of the region while projecting their own power into Egypt to control the Suez Canal, a significant source of revenue [00:09:20].

### Southwestern Frontier: Eastern Mediterranean, Greece, and Cyprus

Looking southwest to the Eastern Mediterranean, specifically Cyprus and Greece, presents a less economically appealing option [00:09:42]. However, the Aegean is the first stop past Istanbul to the wider world [00:09:54]. Therefore, some understanding or occupation of these lands by Turkey would be necessary for wider access [00:10:00]. Unfortunately, Greeks and Turks "do not get along," and Turks and Cypriots "hate each other" [00:10:10]. Furthermore, engaging in this mountainous, naval environment would divert Turkish resources and make it easier for another naval power, such as France, to interfere [00:10:17].

### Northwestern Frontier: The Balkans, Romania, and Bulgaria

The northwest direction leads to the Southern Balkans, particularly Romania and Bulgaria [00:10:36]. This region contains the lowlands of the Danube system, which extend into northern Europe [00:10:42]. Romania and Bulgaria are described as two of the "more sophisticated ethnicities" bordering Turkey [00:10:47]. This area offers potential for general economic activity, energy reserves, and food supplies [00:10:53]. These two countries are also geographically isolated from the rest of Europe by the Carpathian and Balkan mountains, making them easier to defend and more naturally within Turkey's sphere of influence [00:11:00].

## Strategic Recommendations and Challenges

Turkey faces an "embarrassment of opportunities" and possesses significant strength, but not enough to seize every possibility [00:11:36].

Strategically, two primary directions are suggested for Turkey:
1.  **The Balkan Vector:** Pursuing closer ties with Bulgaria and Romania [00:11:26]. These countries already have varying degrees of good relations with Turkey and view each other as reliable economic and security partners [00:11:28]. The historical "bad blood" from the late Ottoman period is largely behind them [00:11:40]. Romanians and Bulgarians recognize that if the U.S. loses interest, their only remaining option is Russia, an experience they would prefer to avoid [00:11:48].
2.  **Deal with Israel:** Forging an agreement with Israel would allow Turkey to bypass Greece to some extent and bring the Suez Canal into its sphere of influence [00:12:05]. This would also complicate efforts by other naval powers, like France or Britain, to penetrate the Eastern Mediterranean from the west [00:12:15].

Despite these strategic recommendations, history often takes unpredictable turns [00:12:24]. Turkey is currently forced to make difficult choices, as history dictates that nations must be selective in their pursuits [00:12:46].

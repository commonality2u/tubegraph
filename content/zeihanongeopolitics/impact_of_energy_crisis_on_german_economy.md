Germany faces an existential energy crisis, stemming from its historical reliance on specific trade relationships and internal policy decisions. This crisis, alongside demographic shifts and trade issues, is projected to dismantle Germany as a modern economy and potentially a nation-state within the next 20 to 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.

## Reliance on Russian Energy and Raw Materials
Historically, Russia was the primary source for many raw materials Germany used, especially energy, with about 40% of its coal coming from there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. The German system was predicated on a "bottomless supply of inexpensive, reliable, secure supplies of energy" primarily from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

Despite diligent efforts, Germany has managed to cut Russian oil and natural gas from its system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. However, this has come at an "exorbitant cost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>, with energy prices tripling or more since the war in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. The continued presence of Russian energy in the international market, even at reduced levels, helps mitigate what would otherwise be even higher prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

Many companies in energy-intensive sectors, such as ceramics, steel, and petrochemicals, are now relocating from Germany because they cannot manage their costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. Even if the Russian system survives, it is not expected to be a significant commodity exporter due to its inability to maintain its own infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

## Current Energy Sources and Challenges
With Russian supplies diminishing, Germany now sources liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. However, LNG transported by ship is inherently less reliable than pipeline supply, as it can be diverted elsewhere based on market and security conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. Crude oil is sourced from the Middle East, a supply chain further complicated by the United States no longer consistently patrolling the Persian Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

Germany has also largely shut down its nuclear power plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. The only remaining "sustainable" energy source is lignite coal, which is produced domestically in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. Lignite and other coal sources are estimated to provide between 40% and 55% of Germany's total electricity needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>.

### Green Party Policies and Carbon Emissions
Ironically, the presence of the Green party in Germany's ruling coalitions has led to a systematic dismantling of relatively low-carbon energy sources like nuclear and natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. This policy shift has favored coal, particularly lignite, resulting in a significant increase in German carbon emissions that is expected to last for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>.

### Renewable Energy Limitations
Germany has invested approximately two trillion dollars in building up a power network and installing solar and wind energy infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. However, the effectiveness of these investments is limited by Germany's climate, where sunlight is often unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. While official figures claim 40% to 70% of electricity from green sources depending on the season, this calculation method is misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>. Power from wind or solar is fed into the system regardless of price, and traditional sources like lignite facilities must remain online to ensure continuous supply when intermittent renewables are not producing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. When accounting for power generated and used at the time of demand, only about 8% to 11% of Germany's electricity comes from green sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. In August, when Germans are typically on vacation and there is more sunlight, excess solar energy is often dumped into neighboring countries like France and Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.

## Broader Implications
The combination of the energy crisis, ongoing trade issues, and [[demographic_challenges_facing_germany | demographic challenges]] renders the current German system unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. The country faces the end of its status as an industrial power within 10 to 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>. This projection assumes no other issues arise, such as the unresolved European debt crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.

### The Nord Stream Pipeline and German Resolve
A significant turning point occurred on September 1, 2022, when Russia shut down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, Germany's primary natural gas source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. Russia publicly stated it would not restart the pipeline unless Germany altered its stance on Ukraine, effectively presenting Germany with a choice: compromise its Western alignment to secure energy or face [[germanys_industrial_decline | de-industrialization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. Despite a 30-year history of aligning with Russia on energy and security matters, Germany chose to remain Western, accepting the energy crisis over capitulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>. This decision, unexpected by many, suggests that Germany may be willing to prioritize "morals and ethics over convenience and wealth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>, potentially leading to a quiet decline rather than a forceful response as previously feared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>.

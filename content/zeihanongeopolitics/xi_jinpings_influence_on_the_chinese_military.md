The structure and efficacy of the Chinese military are significantly shaped by the leadership of [[Impact of Xi Jinpings Leadership on Chinas Governance | Xi Jinping]]. Unlike the United States, where the Defense Secretary formally commands forces and reports to the President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>, China's Defense Ministry lacks operational control over the military or policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. Instead, it functions more as a diplomatic interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. Real decision-making authority lies with the Central Military Commission, which is chaired by Xi Jinping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

## Purges and Centralization

[[Military purges in China | Military purges]] are an extension of a broader, 14-year-long series of purges within the Chinese government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. This campaign aims for [[Centralized power in China under Xi Jinping | Xi to tighten his grip on everything]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. When Xi came to power, China was considered one of the most corrupt countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>, and decision-making was centrally dissociated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. The Chinese Communist Party under Xi seeks to centralize all decision-making through Beijing and personally through Xi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

These purges serve a dual purpose: combating corruption and eliminating perceived political competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Over 12 years, the system was "gutted" of individuals with ambition and competence across various sectors, including local and state government, academia, business, and the federal bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.

### Recent Military Leadership Changes
The [[military_purges_in_china | purges]] have now significantly impacted the military, a sector initially spared because its members "had guns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
*   The previous Defense Secretary was purged in the summer of 2023, disappearing for two months before his formal disposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.
*   A new Defense Minister, Admiral Dong Jun, was appointed in late 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. However, this position holds limited real decision-making power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
*   Approximately 20 top-level military personnel have been fired, with 12 dismissed in a two-week period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. This includes a recently appointed defense minister chosen by Xi himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

## Impact on Military Effectiveness

The Central Military Commission, responsible for military planning, is now reportedly stacked with "incompetent yes-men" or individuals who avoid expressing any opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. This reflects the same structural gutting observed across other parts of China's bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. The bureaucracy now struggles to function because no one wants to transmit information, fearing Xi's response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. This pattern is now evident in military activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.

### Comparison to Previous State
Previously, China's military preparedness and capability were significantly limited by a lack of expertise and widespread corruption, similar to Russian-style theft of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. Under Xi's current approach, a significant portion of the military's waking hours may be spent reading texts written by and about Xi Jinping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. The overall [[Impact of political purges on Chinese military effectiveness | impact of these purges on Chinese military effectiveness]] remains a subject of ongoing analysis.

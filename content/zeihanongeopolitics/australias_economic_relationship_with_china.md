Australia has pursued a "two-faced" foreign economic policy, maintaining a tight alliance with the [[australias_strategic_alliance_with_the_united_states | United States]] while ruthlessly exploiting economic opportunities provided by the American-led security order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Among Western nations, Australia is considered to have become the most economically integrated with [[China's economic strategies and challenges | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Deep Economic Ties and Raw Commodities
[[China's economic dependency on exports | China]] has been Australia's number one customer for raw commodities for most of the last 40 years, with these numbers only increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This includes resources such as bauxite, iron ore, natural gas, and lithium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

The nature of [[Chinas economic strategies and challenges | Chinese demand]] is characterized by a "hyper-financialization system" that prints money and creates bank deposits to fuel industrial development, even if it is not economically viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This system makes [[dependence_of_chinas_economy_on_international_trade | Chinese demand]] largely "price insensitive," meaning they will purchase almost anything at any price to further political goals, typically infrastructure and industrial plant construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Australia has been a primary supplier to [[Chinas economic strategies and challenges | China]] throughout this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Looming Challenges
The relationship with [[Chinas economic strategies and challenges | China]] presents several significant challenges for Australia:

### Impending Economic Adjustment
A large portion of [[Chinas economic strategies and challenges | Chinese demand]] has never been economically viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. When this demand recedes, Australia will have to sell to more economically rational markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. While the market may not completely collapse, the "balls-to-the-wall price-insensitive expansion" experienced over the past few decades will not continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. While Australia can replace [[Chinas economic strategies and challenges | Chinese demand]] with other markets, such as the [[USChina relations and tech_investment | US]] as it reindustrializes and Southeast Asia, the collective demand will not be as substantial as what [[Chinas economic strategies and challenges | China]] previously absorbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. This transition is expected to be a harsh adjustment for the Australian economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

### Failure to Add Value
Australia has consistently remained a raw commodities provider, failing to move up the value-added scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. For example, it exports iron ore but does not produce steel, exports lithium but not batteries, natural gas but not chemicals, and wheat but not flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. The industrial plant necessary to process these raw materials, currently concentrated in [[Chinas economic strategies and challenges | China]], will need to be built elsewhere, including in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Australia is significantly behind in this regard, with efforts only beginning recently, such as negotiating to join the [[USChina relations and tech_investment | US]] Inflation Reduction Act's subsidy regime to help build out processing industrial plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This lack of processing capacity means that even if demand for raw commodities exists elsewhere, other regions will need to establish processing capabilities first, making the adjustment in a post-[[Chinas economic strategies and challenges | China]] environment much worse than necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Potential Financial Crisis
Australia faces a significant homegrown problem related to its housing market, which is described as a subprime issue much worse than what the [[USChina relations and tech_investment | United States]] experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Unlike the [[USChina relations and tech_investment | US]], which forced banks and homeowners to absorb some losses, Australia guaranteed all loans, allowing the problem to deepen and fester for 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Conservatively, Australia's subprime problem is estimated to be at least five times worse in relative terms than that of the [[USChina relations and tech_investment | United States]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. A sharp de-globalization or "de-[[Chinas economic strategies and challenges | China]]" shock could trigger a financial crisis, leading to a depression that could last half a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Strategic Alliance with the United States
Despite these economic challenges, Australia's strong and creative alliance with the [[USChina relations and tech_investment | United States]] offers an upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Australia has historically formed international coalitions to support American policy and has been among the first to commit, recognizing that its security and economy rely on the [[USChina relations and tech_investment | United States']] strategic oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

Australia is one of very few countries to have received a free trade agreement with the [[USChina relations and tech_investment | United States]], granted not for security reasons but because of its long-standing friendship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. In a post-American world, Australia is considered at the very top of the list of allies with whom the [[USChina relations and tech_investment | United States]] will maintain a strong commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This alliance ensures that no matter how severe the economic adjustment, Australia, rooted in its free trade relationship with the [[USChina relations and tech_investment | United States]], will eventually recover due to its abundance of essential resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. The key question remains whether Australia will initiate its economic restructuring before the full impact of these challenges materializes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

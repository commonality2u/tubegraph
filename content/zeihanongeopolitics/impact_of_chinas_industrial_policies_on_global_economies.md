[[Chinas economic strategies and challenges | China]] has implemented industrial policies that have significantly influenced global economies, particularly through its growth model and specific predatory practices.

## China's Industrial Growth Model
[[Chinas economic strategies and challenges | China]] has experienced the fastest economic growth over the last 50 years globally, despite potential overstatement in its data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This robust growth has been partly fueled by substantial industrial subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. With a large workforce in their 20s, 30s, and early 40s, and fewer dependents, [[Chinas economic strategies and challenges | China]] could focus energy on industrial production and consumption, key drivers for GDP growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This focus, combined with heavy investment and state subsidization of industry, led to record-setting growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Predatory Industrial Policies
Beyond its internal growth, [[Chinas economic strategies and challenges | China]] utilized "predatory industrial policies" to absorb the [[Impact of Chinese Collapse on Global Supply Chains and US Industrial Growth | industrial capacity]] of developing countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This involved relocating industrial operations to [[Chinas economic strategies and challenges | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Case Study: Brazil
Brazil is cited as a country that has significantly suffered from these policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. In the 2000s, Chinese entities engaged in joint ventures with Brazilian companies that were, in some cases, world leaders in their sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Through these ventures, [[Chinas economic strategies and challenges | China]] reportedly acquired technologies, transferred them back to [[Chinas economic strategies and challenges | China]], and then established subsidized [[impact_of_chinese_collapse_on_global_supply_chains_and_us_industrial_growth | industrial plant]] to compete globally with Brazilian firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. This strategy not only undermined Brazil's ability to [[chinas_economic_dependency_on_exports | export]] to the international market but also led to the domestic market being flooded with Chinese products, ultimately destroying Brazilian companies at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### Broader Impact on Developing Nations
Many developing countries, after an initial burst of growth for 20-30 years through industrialization, struggled to transition to higher-value-added manufacturing or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. While some, like the Northeast Asian "tigers" (Taiwan and Korea), successfully diversified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, others like Brazil, Nigeria, and South Africa remained primarily raw commodity economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. [[Chinas economic strategies and challenges | China]]'s predatory industrial policies exacerbated this challenge, making it difficult for these nations to develop their own industrial bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

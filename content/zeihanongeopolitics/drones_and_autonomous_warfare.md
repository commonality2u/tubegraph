The modern battlefield is experiencing a second phase of the Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA), largely driven by the **[[role_of_drones_in_modern_warfare | democratization]] of military technologies**, particularly [[role_of_drones_in_modern_warfare | drones]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This shift empowers individual soldiers with advanced information and targeting capabilities, enabling autonomous operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Evolution of Military Affairs

### First Phase (1990s-2000s)
The initial phase of the Revolution in Military Affairs occurred in the 1990s and 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This era saw the United States integrating [[role_of_information_technology_in_modern_warfare | information technologies]] with its military capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This involved combining sensors and targeting information—whether on the weapon itself, delivered via satellites, or attached to ordnance—to achieve high-accuracy targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

Examples include:
*   Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>
*   Tomahawk cruise missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>

This integration allowed for precise targeting, eliminating the need for carpet bombing by enabling one or two weapons to accurately hit a specific target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. While hypersonics were once considered the next major breakthrough, their prohibitive cost and vulnerability to jamming limited their widespread strategic impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Second Phase (Current)
The current phase marks the **[[role_of_drones_in_modern_warfare | democratization]]** of these advanced technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Control has moved from centralized command structures to individual soldiers, who can now autonomously acquire and engage targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This transformation is most evident in [[Ukraine war and military innovation | Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## [[role_of_drones_in_modern_warfare | Drone]] Applications in [[Ukraine war and military innovation | Ukraine]]

[[Ukraine]] has adopted a four-part strategy utilizing [[role_of_drones_in_modern_warfare | drone]] technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>:

### 1. [[Ukrainian Naval drone attacks on Russian military vessels | Naval Drone Attacks]]
[[Ukraine]] has adapted [[role_of_drones_in_modern_warfare | drone]] technology to jet skis, loading them with hundreds of pounds of explosives to target Russian naval vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This strategy has been highly effective, making the western half of the Black Sea largely inaccessible to the Russian Fleet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. A key advantage of these small, low-profile vessels is that larger Russian ships cannot angle their deck-mounted weapons low enough to engage them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### 2. Anti-Personnel Swarm Attacks
In response to challenges in receiving conventional aid, [[Ukraine]] has mass-produced very small [[role_of_drones_in_modern_warfare | drones]] with payloads of about one pound (grenade-sized) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. These are deployed in swarms against Russian human wave tactics, dropping grenades on massed infantry from range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Despite technical losses like the Battle of Avdiivka, [[Ukraine]] has inflicted casualty ratios of 8:1 to 10:1 on Russian forces using these [[role_of_drones_in_modern_warfare | drones]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### 3. [[ukraines_longerrange_drone_capabilities | Mid-Range Infrastructure Strikes]]
[[Ukraine]] has developed [[ukraines_longerrange_drone_capabilities | drones]] for strikes against infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>:
*   **Scythe**: A "garage project" made largely of plywood, with a decent warhead but shorter range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Beaver**: More technologically advanced with longer range and better avionics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

These [[ukraines_longerrange_drone_capabilities | drones]] target infrastructure within a few hundred kilometers of the front line, including refineries and fuel depots within Russian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### 4. Deep Strikes with Phoenix Ghost
The American-supplied Phoenix Ghost [[role_of_drones_in_modern_warfare | drone]] plays a significant role in deep strike operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>:
*   **Characteristics**: Carries a small warhead (5-15 lbs), is modular, can be assembled quickly, and is light enough for a single soldier to carry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Application**: While initially intended for armored vehicles and supply trucks, its accuracy (due to a live visual feed to the controller) and portability allowed [[Ukraine]] Special Forces to carry them into Russia, hundreds or thousands of miles from the front line, to strike unprotected targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **[[economic_and_strategic_warfare_using_drones | Economic and Strategic Impact]]**: These attacks have significantly impacted Russian refining capacity, taking offline an estimated half a million to a million barrels per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. The precision allows targeting of critical refinery components like distillation towers, causing significant damage and disrupting Russian oil processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. This disruption impacts approximately 8% of Russian government revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Broader Implications
The current conflict in [[Ukraine]] demonstrates a new form of warfare, combining strategic, naval, infantry, and [[economic_and_strategic_warfare_using_drones | economic warfare]] in ways not thought possible just months prior, with many [[role_of_drones_in_modern_warfare | drones]] being indigenous [[Ukrainian drone missile innovations | Ukrainian innovations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. This parallels the American Civil War and Crimean Campaign, where observers studied early industrial warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

The first phase of the RMA transformed a "lumbering Cold War defense industry" into one with extreme range and precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. The second phase maintains this precision but marries it to individual decision-making, deploying tens of thousands of decentralized weapons platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. This capability for individuals to target enemy formations at scale across a thousand-mile front and deep into enemy territory is unprecedented in military history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. The full transformative impact of this development is still being understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

The country of Syria, an artificial construct, has not had a functional government in centuries [00:00:38]. Its current form emerged after World War I, during the Mandate period, when former colonies were broken up and independent states were allowed to rise [00:00:47]. While Mesopotamia became Iraq, Saudi Arabia found oil, and Egypt gained independence, Syria was essentially "what was left over" after other powers, such as the Turks (who took the Hatay region) and the French (who created Lebanon), claimed their desired territories [00:00:57]. The Alawites, a minority group living on the coast, eventually took control of Syria by partnering with other minorities against the Sunni Arab majority [00:01:36]. The recent revolution, led by Sunni Arabs, has overthrown the Assad regime, which was Alawite [00:01:52]. This situation suggests a prolonged period of civil war or no man's land, as various groups vie for control [00:01:30].

## Russian Intervention in Syria

Syria's current government would have collapsed a decade ago if not for the Russian government [00:02:03]. Historically, the Soviets were pro-Syrian due to Syria's anti-Israeli stance, which aligned with Cold War politics against the United States [00:02:10]. More recently, the Putin government sought a way to distract European and American attention from its increasingly aggressive wars in its periphery and future operations in Europe [00:02:24]. The existing Syrian Civil War provided a perfect opportunity [00:02:40].

Russia intervened to protect the Assad government, transferring military assets like aircraft and mercenaries, initially under the banner of the Wagner group [00:02:44]. The Wagner group, which later attempted a brief [[implications_of_the_coup_attempt_on_putins_leadership_and_russian_military_strategy | coup]], was initially used by Putin to disguise direct Russian involvement, though the deployment of fighter bombers eventually made their presence obvious [00:02:51]. Russia established a substantial military footprint in Syria, including thousands of troops and one of their most powerful naval task forces [00:03:10]. Despite the Russian Navy not being known for its competence or size, its better ships are deployed to Syrian coastal bases like Baniyas and Tartus [00:03:20].

### Russian Military Tactics in Syria

When Russia intervened in the Syrian Civil War a decade ago, the Assad government was on its last legs [00:03:57]. Russian forces primarily targeted the secular Sunni Arab opposition rather than ISIS [00:04:10]. They used tactics such as firing tens of thousands of artillery shells into populated centers like Aleppo, likely killing around 100,000 people [00:04:17]. These war crime-style military operations were honed in Syria before being employed in Ukraine [00:04:32].

## Current Challenges to Russian Presence

The Russian presence faces significant challenges, particularly regarding logistics and withdrawal:

*   **Logistical Limitations**
    *   [[challenges_to_russian_global_maritime_operations | Russia cannot project power on the seas]] unless other nations permit their transit [00:03:48].
    *   Russia lacks the airlift capacity to extract its forces from interior Syria, unlike the United States' withdrawal from Afghanistan [00:04:48].
    *   This lack of transport options means Russian forces must make a "run for the exits" [00:05:11].

*   **Geographical Constraints for Withdrawal**
    *   To the south, Russian forces would enter Jordan, a U.S. ally [00:05:13].
    *   To the southwest, they would enter Israel, also a U.S. ally [00:05:17].
    *   To the east, they would encounter remnants of ISIS in Iraq, making passage to Iran difficult [00:05:20].
    *   To the north, the Turks, who supported the recent militant push, are "thrilled" by Russian difficulties [00:05:31].
    *   Their only viable exit is a narrow corridor to the coast through Homs, a city militants are targeting [00:05:45].

*   **Naval Limitations and Port Access**
    *   Even if Russian forces reach the ports, their ships are described as "suck[ing]" [00:06:00].
    *   One theoretical escape route is through the Strait of Gibraltar, around Iberia, France, Britain, and Scandinavia to Murmansk in the Arctic Circle [00:06:07]. However, it's doubtful if their ships, even their best ones, can make such a long, unsupported trip [00:06:18]. European nations would likely confiscate any Russian ships attempting to dock due to the war in Ukraine [00:06:26].
    *   The closer port, Novorossiysk in the eastern Black Sea, is subject to the Treaty of Montreux, which Turkey manages and enforces [00:06:38]. This treaty restricts warships from transiting the Turkish Straits between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea [00:06:47]. The Turks control what passes through, and are likely to stall Russian ships on the coast [00:06:56].

The Sunni Arab militants, who intensely dislike Russia, are moving to consolidate control of Syria [00:07:08]. Control of Russian ports and ships in Syria will likely be a high priority for various factions and other countries willing to aid a new Syrian government in exchange for certain considerations [00:07:16]. Destroying Russia's naval task force would be a significant victory for any party [00:07:32].

## Cascading Strategic Collapse

This situation marks the beginning of a series of strategic humiliations for the Russians [00:07:48]. Regardless of the outcome, the loss of these ships and ports would cut off the primary means by which Russia supplies equipment, material, and troops to the African theater [00:07:57]. This will lead to a cascade of [[strategic_and_diplomatic_implications_for_russia | strategic collapses of the Russian position]] across the Middle East and Africa, potentially within weeks or months [00:08:21]. This impact on [[dependence_on_foreign_support_for_russian_military_operations | Russian military reliance on foreign support]] and its operations in regions like Burkina Faso, Niger, Sudan, and Libya is expected to be significant [00:08:04].

The American electoral system, characterized by "first pass the post" single-member districts, naturally encourages a two-party system with "big tent" parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. These large parties inherently contain multiple [[Republican and Democratic Party Factions | factions]] whose power within the party can shift due to evolving technology, geopolitics, and social issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Traditional Republican Coalition Structure

Traditionally, the Republican Party has operated with a numerical disadvantage compared to Democrats, possessing fewer overall voters and [[Republican and Democratic Party Factions | factions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Key [[Republican and Democratic Party Factions | factions]] include pro-lifers, military voters, Law and Order advocates, and business voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

A historical strength of the Republican coalition was that the issues important to these groups typically did not clash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. For example, pro-lifers generally did not concern themselves with business regulation, and the business community was not focused on military policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This allowed for a smaller, but very solid and reliable [[Challenges in Building Political Party Coalition Consensus | coalition]] where members consistently participated in elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Under normal circumstances, the Republicans held an advantage because there were very few "wedge issues" that divided their own [[Challenges in Building Political Party Coalition Consensus | coalition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Donald Trump's Impact on the Coalition

[[impact_of_donald_trump_on_midterm_elections | Donald Trump]] has significantly disrupted this dynamic, introducing numerous wedge issues not only across society but specifically "across the Republican electorate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The presence of candidates aligned with Trump's agenda has complicated the decision-making process for Republican voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

Specific examples of this disruption include:
*   **Military vs. Abortion Factions** The actions of individuals like Tommy Tuberville, who for months prevented military promotions over abortion policy, created a conflict between military voters and abortion votersâ€”two [[Republican and Democratic Party Factions | factions]] that previously had no major points of contention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Alienation of the Business Community** [[impact_of_donald_trump_on_midterm_elections | Donald Trump]]'s leadership style, characterized by a desire for adoration and a dislike for dissent, has largely driven the business community out of the Republican [[Challenges in Building Political Party Coalition Consensus | coalition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This has resulted in the business community becoming "completely alienated" from social conservative voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## Consequences for Republicans

This environment forces Republicans to undergo a "Democratic style cohesion test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The challenge for Republicans is that they already have fewer voters than Democrats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. If [[impact_of_donald_trump_on_midterm_elections | Donald Trump]] becomes the candidate, the party is unlikely to see its entire [[Challenges in Building Political Party Coalition Consensus | coalition]] turn out to vote, which, based purely on numbers, significantly diminishes his chances of winning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This analysis does not even account for the impact of [[impact_of_independents_in_elections | independent voters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

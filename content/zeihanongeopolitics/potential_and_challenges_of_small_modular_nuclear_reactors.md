Small Modular Nuclear Reactors (SMRs) are identified as one of six promising innovations, though currently considered the least likely to achieve widespread impact soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. Despite this, there are technological reasons to anticipate nuclear power's role in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:07">[02:04:07]</a>.

## Potential Benefits

From a technological standpoint, SMRs could resolve numerous issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   **Portability and Incremental Supply** The concept behind SMRs is that they are portable, allowing them to be deployed in cities to provide incremental increases in energy supply as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.
*   **Integration with Existing Infrastructure** SMRs align with many "green" objectives because they can be integrated into existing, decommissioned coal plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. These sites already possess the necessary transformers and electrical grid connections, making SMRs a "plug and play" solution in such environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

## Challenges

The primary hurdles for SMRs are not technological, but political and developmental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.
*   **Political Opposition and Propaganda** Nuclear power has received negative public perception, partly due to Russian propaganda efforts aimed at discrediting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. Some modern environmental movements, such as the German Green Party, have historical ties to Russian propaganda during the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Operationalization** Despite their promise, SMRs are not yet operational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.

## Development and Timeline

A prototype SMR is currently under construction by a corporate alliance involving Nucor and the national lab system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
*   **Prototype Evaluation** It is expected to take one to two years to determine if the prototype is successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
*   **Mass Manufacturing Timeline** If the prototype proves viable, the next steps involve operationalizing the technology and then transitioning to mass manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.
*   **Widespread Adoption** In the most optimistic scenario, significant numbers of SMRs are not expected to be deployed before 2030-2035 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. While SMRs are a very promising technology, they are not yet in existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

A key question concerning the upcoming presidential election is which aspects of American foreign policy will remain consistent, regardless of the winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

## The Decline of Bipartisan Consensus

Until approximately 2012, the United States had a strong bipartisan consensus on foreign and strategic policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. This consensus was rooted in the belief that global communism, epitomized by the Soviet Union, was a threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. To ensure national security and economic well-being, the strategy involved building a worldwide alliance network and promoting a free-trade, globalized world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. This approach aimed to give most countries a vested interest in participating in American security agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>, leading to the formation of NATO and alliances with Japan, Korea, and Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. It also helped integrate the non-aligned world into an economic powerhouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

However, over a 16-year period, starting with Barack Obama's "visceral disinterest in governing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a> and continuing through the economically populist presidencies of [[united_states_foreign_policy_management_under_trump | Donald Trump]] and Joe Biden, this [[the_decline_of_bipartisan_consensus_in_us_foreign_policy | bipartisan consensus has withered away]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. The Republican Party, historically instrumental in shaping these policies, now sees its National Security and business conservatives largely outside its core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. Some Republican factions are even oddly aligned with countries like Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

This indicates that security policy in the United States is no longer a fixed entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>, marking a period of [[shifts_in_us_foreign_policy_and_its_implications | flux]] both internally and internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. Many traditional National Security and economic principles are unlikely to persist because the political parties' institutions that formed them are themselves in upheaval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. The leadership of both Democratic and Republican parties is pushing their institutions into a "nonfunctional era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>, and it will likely be several years before a meaningful discussion about foreign policy can resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

## Presidential Candidates and Policy Uncertainty

Given the current political landscape, the future of American foreign policy is highly unpredictable due to the nature of the potential candidates:

*   **Kamala Harris**: Characterized as "an empty suit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>, her only significant prior experience was as a prosecutor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. She has little experience implementing policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. Early in her vice presidency, she was often at Joe Biden's side but was later given the task of solving the border issue, which was designed to fail due to a lack of power and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. A vote for Harris is a vote for "an unknown" with "very limited experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a> and without a circle of competent, personally loyal advisors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.
*   **Donald Trump / JD Vance**: [[United States foreign policy management under Trump | Donald Trump]] is described as showing signs of "degradation" and "not all there anymore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. If he wins, his age (older than Joe Biden was when he became president) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a> and apparent lack of mental fortitude suggest he may not serve for long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>. A vote for Trump is effectively a vote for JD Vance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. Vance is characterized as "even more of an empty suit than Kamala Harris" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a> and a "chameleon" who will "say anything to get closer to power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.

Both potential future leaders are described as economically populist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>, with limited to no experience in the "real world" or significant government roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. This means institutional loyalties are weak or non-existent, and policy experience that might indicate future priorities is negligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. Since most foreign policy is a presidential prerogative, with Congress having little say in formative stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>, the lack of a clear track record for these individuals makes predicting future policy or reactions to hypothetical scenarios impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. This general uncertainty has significant implications for [[political_dynamics_and_alliances_in_the_united_states_and_its_implications | US alliances and partnerships]].

## Policies Expected to Endure

The only policies likely to persist are those where the president has ceded authority to Congress, locking them in with an act of Congress that limits presidential maneuverability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>. These policies would require a new act of Congress to overturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>.

The most significant policy falling into this category is NAFTA's renegotiation (now USMCA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. The renegotiation, spearheaded by [[united_states_foreign_policy_management_under_trump | Donald Trump]], is viewed as a "brilliant" and "right thing at the right time with the right partner" move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. Mexico has become the United States' top trade partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>, and this relationship is considered central to the U.S. economic future, especially in light of a potentially dangerous and unequal relationship with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.

The fact that this hard work was done by the isolationist right of the United States ensures its stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. Regardless of who becomes the next president—whether Harris or JD Vance—it is unlikely they will have the political authority or interest to overturn it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. This policy is considered the "single most important foreign policy priority the United States has" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a> for preparing for future global dynamics. These include China's increasing belligerence and eventual collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>, the escalating Ukraine war and Russian demographic dissolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>, and the fracturing of the European Alliance due to depopulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>. This reflects the [[influence_of_global_dynamics_on_us_policy_priorities | impact of global geopolitical issues on US foreign policy focus]] and the broader [[shift_in_us_global_strategic_role | shift in US global strategic role]].

[[natos_task_force_in_the_baltic_and_its_implications | Germany is making a permanent military deployment to Lithuania]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This is not part of a UN mission or a rotating program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Approximately 5,000 troops are being deployed to Lithuania as part of Germany's NATO commitments on a permanent basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Historical Context of German Military Policy

Following World War II, the world has spent 75 years ensuring that [[germanys_evolving_role_in_european_security | Germany]] does not have a deployment-capable military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Germany has been embedded within the NATO system, with the United States largely underwriting [[germanys_evolving_role_in_european_security | German physical security]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. For a long time, the Germans have been security consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

While this arrangement has been a financial drain on the United States and other allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, having Germany without a functional military has been deemed critically important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Germany's borders are broadly indefensible, and it is surrounded by countries that, despite being allies now, have historically not been so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The United States has forcibly rewritten the rules of European security, which has helped keep Europe united and at peace for 75 years, especially in the post-Cold War era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. A key part of this arrangement was Germany's agreement to never have an opinion on security matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Shift in German Military Posture

This long-standing agreement now seems to be going by the wayside, as [[germanys_evolving_role_in_european_security | Germany is finally developing capabilities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. While 5,000 troops in Lithuania is not "the end of the world," it signifies the [[germanys_evolving_role_in_european_security | rehabilitation of Germany as a more normal country]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This means Germany will now have military tactics and strategies as part of its toolkit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, and consequently, the Germans will begin to have opinions on security issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

In the short term, this development is largely positive for the European Alliance, as concerns primarily revolve around Russia and Ukraine, where there is general agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. However, the speaker notes a historical pattern: after losing wars, Germany undergoes a period of disarmament, which then ends, leading to Germany using military tactics again, often resulting in rapid escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. While Germany is not an enemy today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, this shift will cause them to see the world differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Implications for Other Nations

This transformation has significant implications for other countries:

### Poland
Poland is currently undergoing a massive rearmament program aimed at preventing future subjugation by Germany or Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This program is partly predicated on the assumption that the Germans do not engage in military action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. The German deployment in Lithuania, even though it requires close cooperation with the Polish government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, will force Poland to pay more attention to its western border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This development makes anyone in Poland, across the political spectrum, nervous due to their historical awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Russia
Russia, under both the Soviet and post-Soviet systems, has benefited from the United States being in charge of regional security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This meant Russia did not have to worry about Sweden, Finland, Germany, or France acting independently, as long as a working relationship with Washington was maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. However, the Ukraine war, despite bringing the alliance closer, has compelled regional powers to take matters into their own hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. While NATO generally operates from the same playbook against Russia, individual nations are taking independent actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

The development of military capabilities by [[germanys_industrial_decline | Germany]], Europe's largest economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, is Russia's "worst nightmare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Historically, [[germanys_evolving_role_in_european_security | Germany]] has always been the country that presented the biggest challenge to Russia in the modern era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, and now they "have tanks again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

The [[wagner_group_coup_attempt_in_russia | Russian coup]] attempt involving the Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin in June 2023 highlighted the unique and often unconventional nature of Russia's governmental and military structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Background of the Russian Government and Military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>

Vladimir Putin's government is characterized by a "clique" of individuals primarily from Saint Petersburg, where Putin served as vice mayor in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Putin's early career as a KGB officer in East Germany focused on "stealing things," a mindset that influenced his approach to governing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This perspective led to a fusion with local organized crime in St. Petersburg, a method continued at the national level when he became leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

While Putin himself is considered relatively clean by Russian leadership standards, those around him, who perform the "dirty work," are often highly corrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This system prioritizes individuals adept at intimidation and wealth extraction over competent managers, leading to a governmental structure intertwined with organized crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This approach shapes the entire system, leading to a lack of strategic thinkers and professional military tactics compared to the Soviet era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Competent figures, like former Finance Minister Michael Kasyanov, have gradually fallen out of favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Rise of Yevgeny Prigozhin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>

Within this environment, Yevgeny Prigozhin, a former caterer, gained significant power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. His rise was not due to traditional competence but rather his embodiment of the "hard man" image revered in Russia's top leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Prigozhin is known for his brutal discipline, including using a sledgehammer, and his extreme views, believing the [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russian war]] efforts in Ukraine have been "far too soft" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## The June 2023 "Coup" Attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>

In June 2023, Prigozhin launched what appeared to be an attempted coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. A deal was reportedly struck where Prigozhin would not attempt to overthrow the government if Wagner personnel signed documents placing them under the Defense Ministry's control, and Prigozhin himself went into exile in Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

Analysis of the event suggests it was likely not a serious coup attempt but rather an "exit strategy" for Prigozhin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Weeks prior, Putin had decided that the Wagner mercenary group would be integrated into the Defense Ministry, meaning Prigozhin had "already lost this fight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The convoy purportedly heading to Moscow consisted of only a "couple of dozen vehicles" and Prigozhin was not part of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This suggests his aim was to secure the "best retirement package" possible, given the Defense Minister's animosity towards him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Implications of the "Coup" Attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>

The events raised several critical questions regarding [[military_industrial_complex_in_russia_and_internal_conflicts | internal conflicts]] within the Russian military and government:

### Loyalty of Wagner and the Russian Military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>

The bulk of Wagner forces followed Prigozhin, and at least one unit of the air defense system within the Russian military joined them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This public display of disloyalty from what was considered Russia's "most effective fighting force" significantly undermines Putin's confidence in his military command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Even if Wagner soldiers are formally integrated, they will likely be viewed as unreliable amidst ongoing conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### Putin's Diminished Authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>

Putin was publicly challenged by a figure "far to his right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Despite the limited nature of the "coup," its occurrence and the fact that the convoy reached within a few hundred kilometers of Moscow reflect poorly on Putin's "grip of the system," his command over military operations, and his ability to control law enforcement and intelligence services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This incident provides "political cover" for others with concerns about the war or Russia in general to speak up, exposing the state as "somewhat Hollow" and Putin's leadership as "relatively incompetent and thin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

### Impact on the Ukraine War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>

The city of Rostov-on-Don, the primary communications and logistics hub for the entirety of the [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russian war]] in Ukraine, was offline for two days during the events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Every hour of disruption meant Russian forces in Ukraine lacked access to critical equipment, ammunition, and reinforcements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

Furthermore, significant Russian forces, including Wagner and Chechen units, were pulled from Ukraine to address the internal threat posed by the coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. This redeployment left many Russian and pro-Russian forces out of position, creating opportunities for Ukrainian advances, particularly in the Donbas region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. The Donbas, conquered by Russia in 2014, lacks defensive works, making it a vulnerable area for Russian forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Ukrainian forces found it "fairly easy" to push eastward into the Donbas, with Bakhmut being a key hot spot where Prigozhin's forces had been previously concentrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

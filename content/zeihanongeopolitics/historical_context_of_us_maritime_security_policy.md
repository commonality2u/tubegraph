The United States' approach to maritime security, particularly regarding international energy markets, has undergone significant changes from its long-standing post-World War II policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Post-World War II Policy Basis

For several decades following World War II, the core of American foreign policy, which informed its [[historical_context_of_american_globalization_policies | globalization policies]], was built on a specific strategic bargain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This policy was not driven by the US's own need for Middle Eastern oil, as the US itself has never significantly imported oil from the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Instead, it was designed to protect the resource and product flows essential to its allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

The strategic premise was that the US would fight "economic wars" to secure global trade, thereby freeing its allies from significant military expenditure and allowing them to focus on economic development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This arrangement also provided the US with control over allied militaries, a crucial factor during the Cold War in case of a confrontation with the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This policy effectively outlined the [[us_navys_role_in_global_protection | US Navy's role in global protection]] and maintaining the maritime order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Shifting US Policy Priorities

Recent years have seen a notable [[shifts_in_us_foreign_policy_and_its_implications | shift in US foreign policy]], leading to a reduction in its commitment to upholding the global maritime order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This change has occurred across administrations, including those of Obama, Trump, and Biden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

A primary driver for this shift is the diminished threat from Russia, which, while potentially resurgent, does not possess the global position of the former Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This [[influence_of_global_dynamics_on_us_policy_priorities | influence of global dynamics on US policy priorities]] means the original strategic imperative for the US's extensive maritime security commitments has largely dissipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

As an illustration of this change, when Iran seized the Suezmax oil tanker "Advantage Sweet" on April 27th, 2023, the US Navy's response was limited to a press release condemning Iran's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This incident highlights that the US no longer prioritizes intervention in international energy markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, and other nations are expected to address such issues without US assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

The US has achieved energy self-sufficiency within North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, meaning that in the event of a significant interruption to global energy flows, it could simply close its borders to energy trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This contrasts sharply with countries like China, whose economy and strategic position rely heavily on the continued US guarantee of freedom of the seas, a guarantee the US no longer actively upholds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

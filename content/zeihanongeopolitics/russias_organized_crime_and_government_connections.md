The [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russian government]] under [[vladimir_putins_involvement_and_potential_motive | Vladimir Putin]] is characterized by a close-knit group primarily from St. Petersburg, where [[vladimir_putins_involvement_and_potential_motive | Putin]] served as vice mayor in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. His background as a KGB officer in East Germany involved stealing assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Historical Context and Putin's Mindset

[[vladimir_putins_involvement_and_potential_motive | Putin]]'s early mindset suggested that the [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russian system]] was incapable of producing value independently, thus necessitating theft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This perspective was evident in St. Petersburg, where he collaborated with local [[role_of_organized_crime_in_russian_cyber_operations | organized crime]] to govern the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Upon becoming a national leader, [[vladimir_putins_involvement_and_potential_motive | Putin]] brought this same approach and his associates to the national level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

While [[vladimir_putins_involvement_and_potential_motive | Putin]] himself is considered "pretty clean" by [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russian leadership]] standards, his inner circle, who perform the "dirty work," have consistently been on the corrupt side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Systemic Corruption and Leadership Selection

The [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russian state]] is inherently corrupt due to a unique selection process for its top officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The unofficial duty of those at the top is to extract wealth from the population and the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This means the system prioritizes individuals skilled in intimidation over effective managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

As a result, [[role_of_organized_crime_in_russian_cyber_operations | organized crime]] operates hand-in-hand with the [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russian government]] at the national level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The methods used to manage an [[role_of_organized_crime_in_russian_cyber_operations | organized crime]] syndicate are the same ones employed by the [[vladimir_putins_involvement_and_potential_motive | Putin]] [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | government]] to run the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This shared mindset has allowed [[vladimir_putins_involvement_and_potential_motive | Putin]] to strike deals with figures like the [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Chechen leadership]], who operate similarly to warlords or robbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Impact on Competence and Military Professionalism

This pervasive mindset within the [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russian system]] means that many of the strategic thinkers from the Soviet era are no longer part of the [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russian government]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This lack of strategic thinking and professionalism is evident in areas like [[russian_security_services_and_intelligence_failures | military tactics and professionalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

Despite [[vladimir_putins_involvement_and_potential_motive | Putin]]'s personal inclinations towards the West, he never developed the necessary skill sets or assembled a competent team to steer the country in a different direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Individuals like former Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, who understood how to manage an economy, have gradually distanced themselves from the [[vladimir_putins_involvement_and_potential_motive | Putin]] [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | government]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

The rise of figures like Prigozhin, a former caterer, is attributed not to his competence but to his embodiment of the "hard man" image in Russia, which resonated with the non-standard quality of the top leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

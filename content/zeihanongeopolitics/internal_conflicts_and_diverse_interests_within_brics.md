The BRICS grouping, initially an acronym for investment purposes, has historically lacked a cohesive organizational structure or shared strategic goals among its original members: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Despite ambitions, internal conflicts and widely divergent interests have consistently limited its ability to function as a unified bloc, a trend exacerbated by its recent expansion.

## Lack of Cohesion in the Original BRICS

The BRICS concept originated from a finance individual's observation about large bond markets in Brazil, Russia, India, and China, with South Africa added later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. It was never founded by its members as a true organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

Key issues demonstrating this lack of cohesion include:
*   **Limited Intra-Group Trade** Beyond exports to China, countries like Brazil, South Africa, and Russia have minimal trade with the other BRICS members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **China's Dominance** The BRICS Development Bank, while formed, receives over 90% of its capital from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Conflicting Agendas** At the BRICS summit in South Africa, each member arrived with distinct and often contradictory desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>:
    *   **Russia** sought solidarity to boycott the West and achieve its objectives in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
    *   **China** aimed to leverage other countries' participation to demand trade concessions from the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
    *   **India** traditionally non-aligned, has increasingly leaned towards the American camp due to China's growing assertiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
    *   **Brazil** maintained a "La Dee Da" stance, characterized by a lack of substance on economic issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
    *   **South Africa**, as host, claimed neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Currency Discussions** Proposals for a global or alternative currency to challenge the dollar consistently falter when details are discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. India, China, South Africa, and the BRICS-owned bank have all expressed disinterest in a global currency, leaving only Russia (advocating for the ruble) and Brazil in favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Expansion and Further Diversification

The decision to expand BRICS by admitting six new members — Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Ethiopia, and Argentina — has been viewed as a move that guarantees the organization will achieve nothing useful in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. [[expansion_of_brics_and_potential_implications | Expansion of BRICS and potential implications]]

### Conflicting Regional Interests
The inclusion of Iran alongside Saudi Arabia and the UAE highlights deep-seated regional rivalries that will likely paralyze the group on significant issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Middle East Security** Saudi Arabia and the UAE are primarily interested in obtaining security guarantees, especially if the United States withdraws from the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Their past use of the U.S. dollar was tied to a bilateral security relationship with the U.S., not a shared economic caucus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Their primary concern is Iran, which itself aims to be in charge of the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Oil Policy** With Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE as members, BRICS now includes opposed powers with conflicting interests in energy policy, making meaningful consensus impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Claims that the expanded BRICS will control global oil production and lead to the downfall of the dollar are dismissed as "absolute nonsense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Economic and Political Liabilities
The newly added members also bring significant economic and political challenges:
*   **Ethiopia** is among the poorest countries globally, landlocked, and not even part of China's One Belt, One Road initiative due to a lack of investment case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Its inclusion appears to be for "African flair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Argentina** is characterized by an "entitlement complex," seeking money without repayment obligations and applying for BRICS membership in hopes of Chinese financial assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. It is anti-debt repayment rather than anti-U.S. dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   **Egypt** is largely a U.S. satellite state, economically and strategically dependent on U.S. aid to maintain peace with Israel and Jordan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Its inclusion might be attributed to India's lingering affinity for the Non-Aligned Movement, in which Egypt was politically potent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

## Prognosis for BRICS

The expansion model of BRICS aligns with organizations that become paralyzed by the differing viewpoints of their members, rather than those led by a single powerful member (like the United States in NATO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. For BRICS to achieve anything meaningful in the midterm, it would require China to subsidize the existence of all members, including economically weak countries like Ethiopia and Argentina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. This approach proved unsustainable for the Soviet Union in the 1970s and is unlikely for China, which is unwilling to pay for influence it cannot control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

While the group might expand into a new "Non-Aligned Movement," it would differ significantly from its Cold War predecessor. China and Russia have clear nationalistic and domineering goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. While many countries in the Global South have not condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine, they are unlikely to follow Russia's or China's lead and become pawns in a new global alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. China's low engagement at the summit, with President Xi Jinping not attending some opening ceremonies, further indicates that China primarily views BRICS as a rhetorical vehicle, not a useful operational one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

The United Kingdom faces crucial decisions in a post-American world, as it is not expected to emerge into this new global landscape without significant adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Economic and Security Context

### Economic Structure
The British economic system never fully adapted to the end of its Empire, continuing to focus on high-value-added goods while importing raw materials and base manufactured goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Upon joining Europe, the UK largely swapped one reliance for another, depending on the European continent for food, wood products, and automotive components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Unlike other former imperial powers, the UK did not make this necessary transition, leaving it in a difficult position post-Brexit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### [[security_concerns_of_the_united_kingdom | Security Concerns of the United Kingdom]]
As an island nation, the UK's primary security concern is the development of navies by other countries that could enable an invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Historically, this has led to a deep suspicion and outright fear of major powers on the Eurasian landmass, including Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, and Napoleonic France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

However, the UK also dislikes non-military superpowers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Proposals for "ever closer Union" within the European Union, particularly regarding a common defense identity, make the UK uneasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The UK prefers to keep defense matters within NATO, where it maintains veto power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Demographic Situation
While the UK's demography is not "super healthy," it is considered the second healthiest within the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This contrasts with the broader European Union, which is described as being on its "final legs" demographically, with major powers like Germany and Italy aging into obsolescence within a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This demographic outlook was a factor in the initial discussions around Brexit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Post-Brexit Challenges
Seven years after Brexit, the UK is still grappling with its meaning and has not yet established a meaningful policy for its role in the new world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Future Strategic Options

The UK faces two primary choices for its future [[strategic_international_relationships | strategic international relationships]]:

### Option 1: Attempt to Form a New Empire
This option involves finding a "new Empire" by forging a series of deals with countries that possess young demographics and can supply raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

> [!warning] Challenges with this option
> *   **Loss of Industrial Advantage:** The UK's historical dominance during the British Empire was due to its early lead in the industrial era, allowing it to project power with a small number of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This world no longer exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
> *   **Inability to Force Issues:** The UK cannot conquer places like India with 50,000 people as it might have centuries ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
> *   **Lack of Preeminence:** It is difficult to envision enough countries agreeing to the idea of British preeminence when the UK cannot force the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
> *   **Mid-Sized Power Status:** The idea of the UK, now a mid-sized power, being the center of a global trade node is seen as a "bit of a stretch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

### Option 2: Partner with the United States
This option involves partnering with a single, large, wealthy country that has more favorable demographic structures and shares the UK's core [[security_concerns_of_the_united_kingdom | security concerns of the United Kingdom]] regarding a united Eurasia as a military power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The only country that fits this description is the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

> [!info] Implications of a US Partnership
> *   **Strict Trade Deal Conditions:** A trade deal with the US would not be a simple "waltz" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. The US is very specific about trade deals and does not like to incorporate systems that could meaningfully compete with its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
> *   **Ceding to US Demands:** The UK would likely have to accede to American demands across various sectors, including agriculture, finance, and manufacturing, potentially even adopting the metric system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
> *   **Loss of Agency:** This partnership would mean the UK loses its "freedom to act" and its "agency," becoming a "subsidiary of the American system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
> *   **Historical Resistance:** Previous UK administrations, including those of Boris Johnson and Theresa May, walked away from trade deal negotiations with the US after learning of the conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

## Conclusion
While the partnership with the US would be a significant blow to the British mindset and ego, it is considered the "best game in town" from both an economic and security perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Despite the current "netherworld" the UK finds itself in, it is highly likely that it will eventually accept this reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

Turkey, a significant power since the 1200s, has historically been an indelible part of [[history_of_middle_eastern_geopolitics_and_trade | Middle Eastern]] and European politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. After a period of withdrawal following World War I, Turkey is now re-emerging onto the global stage under President Erdoğan, navigating a world that is considerably more complex than remembered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Many current problems in the southern Balkans, the Levant, and Mesopotamia can be traced back to the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire a century ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Turkey's Strategic Geography

Turkey's enduring importance stems from its geography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Istanbul, positioned on the Golden Horn and the Turkish Straits, serves as the sole water link between the Mediterranean (and beyond to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans) and the Black Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Through navigable rivers like the Don, Dnieper, and Dniester, and a canal connecting the Don to the Volga, Istanbul provides water access deep into Ukraine and Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. By land, routes extend east into Anatolia towards Persia, India, and China, or northwest through the Balkans into Europe via the Danube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. In a world without widespread global trade, Istanbul is arguably the most economically and strategically vital city on the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

However, during the last 70 years, the American-led global order made Istanbul's unique geography less critical by ensuring safe global seas for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This allowed any nation with water access to participate in global commerce, diminishing the necessity of Turkish control over the Straits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. With the [[us_military_involvement_and_middle_eastern_politics | US gradually withdrawing its guardianship from global waterways]], Turkey is incrementally regaining its strategic importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. As Turkey re-expands its influence into former imperial territories, it finds that while these regions have developed their own perspectives, they generally lack the competence or power to resist Turkish influence, with the possible exception of Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## Directions for Turkish Expansion and Relationships

Turkey faces a "buffet of options" but lacks the power to pursue all of them simultaneously, requiring strategic choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### North: Ukraine and Russia
Turkey has historical interests in Ukraine, having previously controlled the mouths of the Dnieper and Dniester rivers to keep the Russian Empire at bay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Turkish naval forces from Istanbul could sail up thawing rivers to disrupt Russian constructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. In the ongoing Ukraine war, despite political and economic neutrality, Turkey is strategically supporting Ukraine with drones, recognizing that a Ukrainian victory and Russian disintegration would significantly benefit Turkey as the largest natural beneficiary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Northeast: The Caucasus and Azerbaijan
The Caucasus region, known as a place where empires often fail, presents opportunities for Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Azerbaijan, an [[middle_east_geopolitics_and_oil_reliance | oil]] producer (approximately one million barrels/day), sends its oil through the Caucasus to Turkey, either via a pipeline to Ceyhan on the Mediterranean or by sea through the Black Sea, which must pass Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Thus, tapping into the region's riches requires Turkish involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Azerbaijan is ethnically Turkic and has historically allied with Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Recent military successes by Azerbaijan against Armenia in 2023, which effectively destroyed the Armenian military, have left the future of the Armenian state in question, with Turkey as a potential broker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. This highlights [[geopolitical_tensions_in_the_middle_east | geopolitical tensions]] in the area.

### East: Iran
East of Turkey lies Iranian Azerbaijan, home to an ethnic group similar to those in independent Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Iran has historically been concerned about an independent Azerbaijan due to the larger Azeri population within Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. These Iranian Azeris are also ethnic kin to Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. A military confrontation between the Turkish military, described as "one of the best in the world," and the Iranian military, characterized as "barely trained infantry," would likely favor Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. However, the mountainous terrain would make such a conflict a long-term, serious commitment for Turkey, limiting its ability to act elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

### Southeast: Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf
Moving southeast, Turkey reaches Mesopotamia, a region inhabited by Kurds (a minority group spanning Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This area holds significant [[middle_east_geopolitics_and_oil_reliance | oil]] and gas reserves, along with wheat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Access to the Persian Gulf would make Turkey a major player in the world's largest free energy market, especially as American protection of global energy declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, allowing Turkey to become an energy broker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

### South: The Levant and Israel
Directly south, Turkey borders the Levant, where Israel is located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. Historically, during the first half of the Cold War until around 1979, Israel, Turkey, and Iran were close allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. After Iran's shift, Turkey and Israel remained allies until Erdoğan's rise, who harbors a mutual disdain for Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Erdoğan's stance reflects a desire to reclaim the Ottoman legacy of religious leadership, seeing the "oppression" of Palestinian Arabs (Muslims) by Jews of Western European descent as problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. While conflict is possible, it would require Turkey to invade Syria and Lebanon first, a chaotic prospect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. A "smarter play" would be cooperation, as an alliance between Turkey and Israel could keep other powers out of the region and allow them to project power into Egypt to control the Suez Canal, generating significant revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

### Southwest: Eastern Mediterranean, Cyprus, and Greece
Economically, the Eastern Mediterranean, including Cyprus and Greece, offers little to Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. However, the Aegean Sea is the first gateway from Istanbul to the wider world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Therefore, some form of understanding or occupation of these lands is necessary for Turkey to access the broader world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. The historical animosity between Greeks and Turks, and intense hatred between Turks and Cypriots, complicates matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Engaging in this mountainous region with extensive naval frontage would divert Turkish naval resources, potentially allowing other naval powers like France to intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### Northwest: Southern Balkans (Romania and Bulgaria)
To the northwest, the Southeastern Balkans, specifically Romania and Bulgaria, present different opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. This region features the lowlands of the Danube system, which extends into northern Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Romania and Bulgaria are more sophisticated ethnicities compared to other border countries, offering prospects for general economic activity, energy reserves, and food supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Furthermore, these countries are geographically isolated from the rest of Europe by the Carpathian and Balkan mountains, making them easier to defend and naturally aligning them within Turkey's sphere of influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## Turkey's Strategic Choices

Turkey cannot pursue all these [[potential_alliances_and_partnerships_in_the_middle_east | opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. From a strategic perspective, two primary paths stand out:

1.  **The Balkan Vector**: Developing strong economic and security partnerships with Bulgaria and Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. These countries have warmed to Turkey, seeing each other as reliable partners, and the animosity from the late Ottoman period has largely diminished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. They recognize that without US engagement in the region, Turkey represents a more favorable alternative than Russia, given their Cold War experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
2.  **A Deal with Israel**: Forging an agreement with Israel would allow Turkey to bypass Greece, incorporate the Suez Canal into its sphere, and complicate attempts by other naval powers (like Britain or France) to enter the Eastern Mediterranean from the west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

Ultimately, Turkey faces an "embarrassment of opportunities" and possesses significant strength, but not enough to seize every possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. History demands difficult choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

China is currently experiencing a "triple economic funk" and has not fully recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic, unlike many other countries that saw an explosion in consumption post-lockdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Growth in China is now lower than it was during the supposed complete lockdown of the past two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Consumption is down, and both imports and exports dropped by double-digit percentages in July compared to the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This magnitude of decline is typically only seen in countries like Ukraine or Russia during wartime, yet it's happening as China is supposedly returning to normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Deep-Seated Economic Challenges

The current economic difficulties are not solely post-COVID phenomena. Several underlying issues contribute to [[Chinas Economic Decline and Consumer Spending | China's economic decline]]:

### Demographic Decline Pre-Dating COVID
A "demographic bomb" began to manifest in China before COVID-19, with demographics turning negative as early as 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. From 2017 to 2021, the birth rate dropped by approximately 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Even in the months leading up to COVID, new car sales – a key indicator of population confidence and spending – went negative and have not recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

The majority of consumption in a modern system occurs when people are in their 20s and 30s, buying cars, raising children, and building homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. However, due to the one-child policy, China has a very small generation in this age bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Since the one-child policy is over 40 years old, a full generation has not had kids, which is now evident in the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Emergence of Deflation
While most of the world, including the United States, Europe, India, Brazil, and Indonesia, experienced significant inflation post-COVID due to a consumption surge and shifting demand patterns, China has gone in the opposite direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

In China, the expected consumption boom never materialized, so supply chains did not need to adjust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Instead, people are less confident about their future and are consuming less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Simultaneously, mounting trade wars with Europe, Japan, the United States, and increasingly secondary states like Korea, mean China has fewer places to export goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This has led to products normally produced for export being trapped within the Chinese system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. The combination of an oversupply of goods and an under-demand both domestically and abroad leads to falling prices, resulting in deflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

While only one month of data currently supports this trend, it aligns with what would be expected at the beginning of a deflationary spiral caused by a fundamental mismatch between supply and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. This mismatch is exacerbated by deglobalization and China's demographic trends, which are past the point of no return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

## Comparison to Japan's Deflationary Period
The last country to face a major burst of deflation was Japan, starting in the late 1990s and lasting for 20 to 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Once prices begin to drop due to a supply-demand mismatch, it is extremely difficult to reverse course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

Typically, two approaches are used:
1.  **Reduce Supply:** This means closing productive capacity, leading to job losses and further reduced spending, which perpetuates the mismatch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
2.  **Increase Demand:** Usually through government stimulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. However, this may not work in China due to the massive demographic issues and the nature of its economic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### The Ineffectiveness of China's Investment-Led Model
China's economic system is primarily based on investment, where the state fosters mass borrowing to build industrial plants and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This accounts for 40% to 70% of the Chinese economy and has driven most of its economic growth for 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. However, there's a limit to how many bridges or factories are needed, a point China likely reached before COVID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

Additional spending is unlikely to help, as the growth generated per Yuan spent has been steadily dropping for 40 years and is now less than one-to-one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. China cannot generate more economic activity than the cost of the input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This situation mirrors Japan's experience in the late 1990s and early 2000s when their economic model became unsustainable, leading to negative income on investments and prolonged deflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### China's Disadvantages Compared to Japan
Japan had several advantages when it entered its deflationary period:
*   An existing global supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>
*   Global allies and options for offshoring manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>
*   Strong demand from the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>
*   A good political relationship with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>
*   Crucially, Japan was already a rich country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>

In contrast, the average Chinese citizen today has an income that is only about a quarter or a fifth of the average Japanese citizen's income in 2000 (in inflation-indexed terms) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. China is becoming old and entering a permanent recession and deflationary spiral *before* getting rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

## Outlook
If these trends continue, the situation for [[Challenges in the Chinese economy | China's economy]] is expected to worsen significantly in a relatively short period, as years of suppressed damage are now bursting out simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Furthermore, China's political system, which is largely centered around a single "Cult of Personality," has almost no capacity to devise a creative solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Even in Japan, where public discussion was allowed, it took a generation to recover from deflation, and they had the benefit of strong alliances, which China lacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

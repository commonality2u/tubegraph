The global order is undergoing significant changes, with the [[us_policy_shift_in_the_middle_east | US strategic relationship]] and its post-Cold War global role evolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This shift raises questions about the future for smaller countries and the broader landscape of [[geopolitical_tensions_in_the_middle_east | global security]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Shifting US Global Engagement

The United States is reevaluating its global position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. In the past, during the Cold War, the US provided economic and strategic concessions to build alliances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. However, in a more "disassociated America," countries must offer the US something to maintain its involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Japan, for instance, realized that the Americans were losing interest globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. To ensure its economic health, which is dependent on international trade and energy imports, Japan sought a deal with the US on America's terms, offering trade concessions and a security partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. For smaller, less capable nations than Japan, this need for aggressive and generous offerings is even more critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

New Zealand, due to its geographic isolation, faces fewer direct security concerns, with its primary interest being economic, particularly its agricultural exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. For most other nations, however, securing US engagement requires creative and deep offerings, as the US has few current interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## [[us_military_involvement_and_middle_eastern_politics | US Military Involvement and Middle Eastern Politics]]

The US has aimed to disengage from its long-standing role of managing global shipping and maintaining [[geopolitical_tensions_in_the_middle_east | global order]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Despite this, actions by the Houthi in the Red Sea have seen the US Navy involved, but this appears to be a "placeholder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### Red Sea Operations and Naval Limitations
The Red Sea has become a testing ground for American missile interdiction capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. It has revealed the difficulty in preventing a hostile group from launching numerous weapon systems over a wide area, stretching US Naval capacities to their breaking point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. The US Navy was designed to interdict threats aimed at itself, not to patrol vast territories against widespread attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. US Naval commanders now understand that if a "real country" were to engage in such widespread attacks, the US would have limited capacity to counter them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This highlights that the US can no longer single-handedly police global oceans against modern technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### Reinforcing Disengagement from the Middle East
The idea of the US being pulled back into the [[us_military_involvement_and_middle_eastern_politics | Middle East]] is not anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. The Gaza conflict has further reinforced the US's desire to limit its engagement with the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

> [!INFO] Historical Parallel
> The US is having conversations with Israel similar to those it had with France and Germany in the 2010s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. At that time, the US warned European allies about Russia's aggressive actions in Georgia, Ukraine (Donbas), and Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. European nations, particularly Germany, were moving towards military disarmament in an assumed "new era of peace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. The Ukraine War subsequently altered European perspectives dramatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

Similarly, the US has publicly stated its intent to withdraw from the [[us_military_involvement_and_middle_eastern_politics | Middle East]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Israel, however, seemed to interpret this as a desire to double down on the alliance with Israel against the rest of the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. The Gaza War has underscored the US's distaste for being drawn into another long-range [[us_involvement_in_major_conflicts | conflict]] in the [[us_military_involvement_and_middle_eastern_politics | Middle East]] to fulfill Israeli government objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Recent discussions on arms transfers are compelling Israel to realize it is not a "special exception" that will keep the US deeply involved in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

## European Security Dynamics and Regional Powers

The emergence of the largest land conflict in Europe since World War II, the Ukraine-Russia War, has led to shifts in how regional powers within broader Europe behave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. France, Sweden, and Turkey are identified as the key countries that will shape the future of Europe, NATO, and the EU for the remainder of the century due to their healthy demographics and geographic freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Countries like Spain, Germany, Italy, and Poland are expected to decline demographically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Evolving Alliances and Challenges
*   **France and Sweden**: The French government is increasingly aligning its talking points with Sweden, particularly on energy security and manufacturing self-sufficiency in partnership with neighboring countries, in opposition to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Their coordination in Ukraine will set a pattern for their future bilateral relationship, which currently appears positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Turkey**: Turkey possesses a radically different culture and economic structure, with a foot in the [[us_military_involvement_and_middle_eastern_politics | Middle East]], complicating its position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. While there's increased cooperation compared to previous decades, it might not last long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Turkey's size and dominance in its neighborhood, especially with the potential for massive [[geopolitical_tensions_in_the_middle_east | geopolitical expansion]] if Russia loses the Ukraine war, could make other powers uneasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

This emerging dynamic could resemble the 1500s, with a Swedish-German-French axis where Germany is a junior and fading partner, and Turkey seeking to expand its influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

The overarching theme is a growing realization that the US is changing and seeking to become a "free agent" globally, marking a different world from two decades ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

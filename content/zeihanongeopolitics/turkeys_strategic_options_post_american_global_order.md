Turkey, a nation with a rich history as a major power dating back to the 1200s, is re-emerging on the global stage following a period of withdrawal after its defeat in World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This re-emergence, spurred by the rise of President Erdoğan, signifies a period where Turkey is "relearning the world around them and discovering it's a lot messier than they remember" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Geopolitical Significance of Location

Istanbul, Turkey's key city, holds immense geopolitical significance due to its location on the Turkish Straits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. These straits are the sole water access point between the Mediterranean (and beyond to the Atlantic and Indian Ocean) and the [[turkish_strategic_policy_on_the_black_sea | Black Sea]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Through navigable rivers like the Don, Dnieper, and Dniester, and a canal linking the Don to the Volga, Istanbul provides water access deep into Ukraine and even the Russian interior to Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

By land, Turkey connects east to Persia, India, and China via Anatolia, and northwest into Europe via the Balkans, with the Danube River also providing access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. In a world without widespread global trade, Istanbul is arguably the most important city economically and strategically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### Impact of the Post-American Strategic Order

For the past 70 years, the American-created global order made Turkey's geography less critical, as the US ensured safe global seas for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This allowed any nation with access to a body of water to engage in global trade freely, unlike the pre-globalized era where navies would guard their commerce and attack others' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This shift diminished Turkey's geographical advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

However, as the US gradually withdraws its guardianship from global waterways, Turkey is "becoming incrementally more important" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. As Turkey re-expands its influence into former imperial territories, it finds that these regions have developed their own opinions, but largely lack the competence or power to resist Turkish influence, with the possible exception of Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This presents Turkey with a "wonderful buffet of options" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Turkey's Strategic Choices

Despite the numerous opportunities, Turkey lacks the power to pursue all directions simultaneously and must make choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### Northern Direction: Ukraine and the Black Sea
Historically, Turkey controlled the mouths of the Dnieper and Dniester rivers, keeping the Russian Empire at bay for a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Turkish naval forces from Istanbul could sail up rivers during thaws to destroy Russian naval constructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. During the Ukraine war, while politically and economically on the fence, Turkey strategically supports Ukraine by providing drones, understanding that Ukraine's victory and a Russian defeat would primarily benefit Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Northeastern Direction: The Caucasus
The Caucasus region is often where empires decline, and Turkey's empire also faced challenges there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. However, it offers opportunities, particularly with Azerbaijan, a Turkic nation and oil producer (around one million barrels daily) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This oil flows through the Caucasus to Turkey via pipelines to the super-port of Ceyhan in the Mediterranean, or by sea through Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Turkey's involvement is crucial for tapping these riches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Azerbaijan, ethnically Turkic, has been allied with Turkey since the Soviet Union's collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Recent Azerbaijani military victories over Armenia in 2023 place the future of the Armenian state in question, with Turkey as the potential broker for any deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

### Eastern Direction: Iran
Moving straight east from Turkey leads to Iranian Azerbaijan, where the ethnic group is similar to those in independent Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Iran has historically been nervous about an independent Azerbaijan due to the larger Azeri population within Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. The Turkish military, considered one of the best in the world, could potentially confront the Iranian military, which is seen as "barely trained infantry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. However, such a conflict in mountainous terrain would be a significant and long-term commitment for Turkey, limiting other actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

### Southeastern Direction: Mesopotamia and the Kurds
To the southeast lies Mesopotamia, home to the Kurds, a minority group present in Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This region offers oil, gas, and some wheat, along with access to the Persian Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Gaining access to the Persian Gulf would allow Turkey to become a key broker in the world's largest free energy market, especially as American protection for global energy markets diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

### Southern Direction: The Levant and Israel
Directly south, Turkey borders the Levant, where Israel is located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. Historically, Israel and Turkey were close allies, a relationship that persisted after Iran distanced itself in 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. However, President Erdoğan's administration has not favored Israel, and the feeling is mutual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Erdoğan's stance reflects a historical Turkish perspective where Ottoman Turks were both regional superpowers and religious leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. A conflict with Israel would necessitate invading Syria and Lebanon first, which is undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. A smarter play would be cooperation between Turkey and Israel, enabling them to keep other powers out of the region and project their own influence into Egypt, thereby controlling the Suez Canal for significant economic gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

### Southwestern Direction: Eastern Mediterranean (Cyprus and Greece)
The Eastern Mediterranean, including Cyprus and Greece, offers little economic benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. However, the Aegean Sea is the first gateway to the wider world beyond Istanbul, making some form of understanding, or even occupation, of these lands necessary for broader access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Relations are strained between Greeks and Turks, and Cypriots and Turks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Engaging in this mountainous, naval-heavy region would make Turkey vulnerable to interference from other naval powers like France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### Northwestern Direction: Southern Balkans (Romania and Bulgaria)
Moving northwest into the southeastern Balkans, specifically Romania and Bulgaria, presents opportunities through the Danube system's lowlands that extend into northern Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. These nations are more sophisticated than some of Turkey's other neighbors and offer economic activity, energy reserves, and food supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Romania and Bulgaria are also geographically isolated from the rest of Europe by the Carpathian and Balkan mountains, making them naturally more defensible and within Turkey's sphere of influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## Strategic Recommendations

From a strategic perspective, two primary options stand out for Turkey:

*   **The Balkan Vector:** Pursuing closer ties with Bulgaria and Romania is a strong choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. These countries generally have warm to cool relationships with Turkey and view each other as reliable economic and security partners, with much of the past animosity behind them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. They recognize that if the US disengages from the region, their limited alternatives make Turkey a preferable partner over Russia, given their negative experiences during the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   **Cooperation with Israel:** Forging a deal with Israel allows Turkey to bypass some challenges with Greece, bring the Suez Canal into its sphere of influence, and make it more difficult for Western Mediterranean powers like Britain or France to project force into the Eastern Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

Turkey faces an "embarrassment of opportunities" and possesses significant strength, but not enough to seize every single possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. This requires making difficult, selective choices in its foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

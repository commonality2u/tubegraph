The United States' military strategy has evolved since the Cold War, adapting to new geopolitical landscapes and potential threats.

## Evolution of US Military Strategy

During the Cold War, the United States maintained a military policy designed to fight "two and a half wars" simultaneously. This entailed the capacity for two major conflicts (e.g., with the Soviets) and a smaller "brush fire" conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. In the post-Cold War era, this policy has shrunk to the capacity for one major conflict, reflecting a more concentrated and focused deployment of US assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Simultaneous Engagements with Russia and China

Despite the shift, concerns have been raised about the United States' ability to engage in conflicts with Russia and China simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. According to Peter Zeihan, the US is capable of handling both scenarios concurrently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### The [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_us_interests | Russia-Ukraine Conflict]]

The nature of the [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_us_interests | Russia-Ukraine conflict]] prevents direct US involvement due to the significant risk of nuclear escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Instead, the United States supplies Ukraine to conduct the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The military assets transferred to Ukraine largely consist of decommissioned equipment from the 1970s and 1980s, which the US no longer considers part of its active military balance sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. In a unique way, this transfer is noted as saving the US money on disposal costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The US Army's primary equipment remains available for other uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, and artillery shell production has increased fivefold since the war began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Potential Clash with China

A potential [[potential_conflict_scenarios_between_china_and_the_united_states | clash with China]] is anticipated to be predominantly a naval engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Feasibility of Dual Conflicts

The United States is capable of simultaneously engaging in a land war on the western end of Eurasia and a naval war on the eastern end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The military supplies required for these distinct types of forces differ, and the US possesses the capability to provide them concurrently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This scenario is described not as a single, complex operation, but as two fundamentally different endeavors with separate command structures and military assets that do not require concurrent deployment in the same location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. While this capability exists, the speaker does not advocate for war with either power, nor does he believe such conflicts are likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

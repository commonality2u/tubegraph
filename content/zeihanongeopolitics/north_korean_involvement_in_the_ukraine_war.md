Recent reports indicate a potential shift in the dynamics of the [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_us_interests | Ukraine war]] with increasing [[use_of_north_korean_troops_in_the_ukraine_conflict | North Korean involvement]] and its broader geopolitical implications. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>

## Reports of Deployment and Assistance
There are reports that [[use_of_north_korean_troops_in_the_ukraine_conflict | North Korean troops]] are in the process of deploying to [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Russia]], with some technical advisors already present to assist the [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Russians]] in using [[use_of_north_korean_troops_in_the_ukraine_conflict | North Korean weaponry systems]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a> Open discussions in South Korea involve intercepts from Pyongyang about an actual troop deployment, possibly for front-line combat. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>

The South Korean reports are taken seriously, as they are not known for fabricating information, unlike their reputation for electronics, manufacturing, and heavy drinking. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>

Beyond potential troop deployment, [[use_of_north_korean_troops_in_the_ukraine_conflict | North Korea]] is providing ballistic missiles and artillery shells to the [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Russians]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a> It's estimated that up to half of the artillery shells used by the [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Russians]] in [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_us_interests | Ukraine]] this year are from [[use_of_north_korean_troops_in_the_ukraine_conflict | North Korea]], despite their poor quality, with many reportedly malfunctioning and damaging [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Russian]] artillery tubes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>

## Strategic Implications
### Intelligence Gathering
The [[use_of_north_korean_troops_in_the_ukraine_conflict | North Koreans]] have not engaged in combat since 1953, meaning no living [[use_of_north_korean_troops_in_the_ukraine_conflict | North Korean]] soldier has fired a rifle in anger. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a> Their participation in the [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_us_interests | Ukraine war]] would offer an "intelligence bonanza" for the United States and South Korea, providing crucial insights into their military performance in real-world conditions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a> This information could allow for a remapping of war plans for the Korean Peninsula. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>

### Parallels with [[iranian_participation_in_the_ukraine_conflict | Iranian Participation]]
Similar to [[use_of_north_korean_troops_in_the_ukraine_conflict | North Korea]], [[iranian_participation_in_the_ukraine_conflict | Iran]] is also involved, providing Shahed drones, with over a thousand having been used. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a> This presents an intelligence opportunity to understand their systems. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>

Given recent [[iranian_participation_in_the_ukraine_conflict | Iranian]] ballistic missile launches against Israel and the Biden Administration's implicit approval for an Israeli response, there's a potential for the U.S. to provide target coordinates to Israel. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a> This could allow Israel to target facilities manufacturing Shahed drones as part of their retaliation, thereby removing a significant military capability source for the [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Russians]] in the [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_us_interests | Ukraine war]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a> Additionally, Israel could extend its assassination campaigns to include drone technicians, akin to how [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Russian]] campaigns target [[iranian_participation_in_the_ukraine_conflict | Iranian]] nuclear scientists. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>

### [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Russia's]] Dependence on "Fourth-String Countries"
The fact that [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Russia]] relies on countries like [[use_of_north_korean_troops_in_the_ukraine_conflict | North Korea]] and [[iranian_participation_in_the_ukraine_conflict | Iran]] for a significant portion of its artillery shells and drone warfare highlights a severe weakness in [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Russia's]] ability to sustain the war long-term. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a> This suggests a decline in the technical skills within [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Russia's]] military-industrial complex, indicating a future reliance on weapon imports. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a> This vulnerability makes the [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Russian]] war machine easier to target by disrupting supply chains in places like Isfahan rather than Siberia. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>

## Increased Involvement of South Korea and Israel
The involvement of [[use_of_north_korean_troops_in_the_ukraine_conflict | North Korea]] and [[iranian_participation_in the_ukraine_conflict | Iran]] in the [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_us_interests | Ukraine war]] has inadvertently drawn South Korea and Israel into the conflict. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a> Both countries had previously sought to avoid significant involvement due to their own regional security concerns. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a> However, with [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in the_ukraine_war | Russia]] now "stirring the pot in their own backyards," political restrictions on their involvement are loosening. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>

South Korea is one of the world's top five arms exporters, capable of producing artillery, rocket systems, and tanks comparable to those from Germany, [[french_involvement_in_ukraine | France]], or the U.S. at a lower price point. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a> They have already secured a deal to supply Poland with over a thousand tanks. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a> Providing this assistance to [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_us_interests | Ukraine]] would be a logical step. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>

Israel, a world leader in anti-missile, anti-artillery, and anti-rocket technologies (like the Iron Dome system), faces the threat of [[use_of_north_korean_troops_in_the_ukraine_conflict | North Korean]] artillery and rocket attacks on Seoul in any theoretical Korean War scenario. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a> Cooperation between Israel and South Korea, where Israel provides technical acumen on specific weapon systems and South Korea provides mass production capabilities, could significantly alter the strategic calculus for both nations and the entire Western Alliance. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>

## [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Russia's]] Strategic Blunder
The decision by [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Russia]] to involve [[use_of_north_korean_troops_in_the_ukraine_conflict | North Korea]] in the [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_us_interests | Ukraine war]] is considered a strategic blunder. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a> While it may offer a short-term tactical advantage in terms of ammunition, it risks bringing in powerful new players like South Korea and Israel, potentially working together, which could profoundly change the conflict's trajectory. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>

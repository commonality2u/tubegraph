On February 5th, Iranian-backed militants in [[Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East | Syria]] attacked a US base, striking barracks with a drone and injuring half a dozen Kurds being trained by US Special Forces [00:00:04]. This was the first significant attack since three American soldiers were killed the previous week, which had led to US retaliatory strikes against Iranian-backed militias throughout the region [00:00:13]. This event underscores the ongoing challenges related to [[US involvement in the Middle East and challenges in global security | US involvement in the Middle East]] and the persistent issue of militant groups.

## Historical Context of Instability
For roughly a thousand years, from 1000 AD to 1500 AD, the [[Middle East]] served as a trade intermediary between the industrializing West and East Asia, facilitating the movement of goods like spices, porcelain, and silks [00:00:51]. This period saw significant markups due to numerous middlemen along land and coastal routes [00:01:30].

After 1500 AD, the development of deep-water navigation by the Spanish and Portuguese allowed direct access to the East, bypassing the [[Middle East]] entirely [00:03:05]. As a result, the region became a "complete backwater" until about 1900 [00:03:17]. When Western countries, already industrialized, returned to the [[Middle East]], they easily divided the region into mandates and colonies [00:03:22].

The historical lack of widespread rainfall in the [[Middle East]], unlike Europe, meant limited areas for agriculture and less incentive for individual economic pursuits [00:04:47]. Where water was available, typically along coasts or rivers, it was easy for political authorities to dominate the geography, often reducing populations to "slave status" [00:04:24]. This environment discouraged stability and technological dissemination within cultures, making the power of the state almost total [00:04:47]. Consequently, when Industrial Technologies like gunpowder and cannons were introduced, the [[Middle East]] was left behind, unable to contest Western powers [00:05:24].

Today, the [[Economic and military relationships in the Middle East | economies of the Middle East]] are significant globally, primarily due to oil, an essential asset for industrial economies [00:05:39]. While North America is an oil exporter and self-sufficient, Europe, especially since the reduction of Russian crude, remains heavily reliant on Middle Eastern oil [00:05:54].

## The Rise of Militant Groups
Post-1950, the [[Middle East]] entered a new era where it had access to industrial technologies. Groups like ISIS in [[Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East | Syria]], despite not being pinnacles of human technology, can easily acquire explosives and AK-47s [00:06:38]. This changed the dynamic from the colonial era, where Western industrial powers faced non-industrialized tribal systems [00:06:49].

The governing systems in the [[Middle East]] are often "brittle top-down concentrated political systems" that are "incapable of providing the people with a level of technological progress that is possible elsewhere in the world" [00:07:46]. This, combined with weak societal structures, leads to the proliferation of numerous militant groups [00:08:09]. Overthrowing existing governments, even by militant groups, often results in "complete societal breakdown," as seen in [[Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East | Egypt]], [[Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East | Iraq]], and [[Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East | Syria]] [00:08:16].

## US Intervention and the "Forever Wars"
Following the 9/11 attacks, the Bush Administration sought to combat Al-Qaeda by pressuring countries that allowed it to operate [00:08:36]. Recruitment for Al-Qaeda was observed from [[Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East | Syria]] (which used it to get rid of dissidents), Taliban troops fled through [[Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East | Iran]], and elements within [[Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East | Saudi Arabia]] provided ideological and financial support [00:08:53].

Instead of conquering [[Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East | Syria]], [[Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East | Saudi Arabia]], and [[Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East | Iran]] – a daunting task – the US decided to invade and occupy [[Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East | Iraq]] with armored tank brigades [00:09:34]. The rationale was to deter [[Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East | Tehran]], [[Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East | Damascus]], and [[Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East | Riyadh]] by demonstrating US military capability and proximity, forcing them to confront Al-Qaeda themselves [00:09:56]. This strategy was largely effective in dismantling Al-Qaeda [00:10:29].

However, the US then attempted to transform [[Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East | Iraq]] into a Western-style nation, which proved impossible due to the lack of societal foundations [00:10:41]. This led to the overthrow of existing stable order and its replacement with "nothing" [00:10:49].

::danger | The "Forever Wars"
The US has remained in the [[Middle East]] because no political leader wants to be blamed for the resurgence of militant groups like ISIS [00:11:18]. The fundamental problem is that countries in the region "are never going to have the foundation that's necessary to form a country in the way that Americans or Westerners... see it" [00:11:30]. If the goal is to prevent the creation or resurgence of specific types of militancy, the US presence "will be there forever" [00:11:42]. This led to the term "forever wars," where the conflict is against a military tactic rather than a specific group [00:11:51].

## The Current Dilemma for US Involvement
The current situation, where the US operates from bases and strikes militant groups when they emerge, is "the best that we can hope for unless the strategy changes" [00:12:09]. The US cannot transform these countries into Western-style nation-states due to their inherent economic geography [00:12:15].

The US faces two primary options for its [[US military involvement and Middle Eastern politics | military involvement]]:

1.  **Stick it out forever:**
    *   Maintain forces in bases, monitoring and striking militant groups like ISIS when they resurface [00:13:39].
    *   This approach means remaining in the region indefinitely, facing continuous "pot shots" from other militant groups, including Iranian-backed ones [00:12:55]. This current dynamic is described as "the new normal" or "the old normal" for the region [00:13:09].

2.  **Leave:**
    *   This would be simpler from a casualty perspective [00:13:16].
    *   The danger is that groups specifically disliked by the US could "boil up" [00:13:24]. The fear is that a withdrawal would lead to more groups emerging faster, eventually threatening US interests in the region [00:13:48]. However, this theory assumes that continued US presence can somehow improve the situation, which is unlikely given the region's nature as "fortress cities" [00:13:56].

The continued US presence has an unintended consequence: it prevents other regional powers from acting more aggressively to deal with militant groups [00:14:31]. For example, the US presence in [[Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East | Syria]] removes "unknowns" for [[Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East | Damascus]] (Syria) and [[Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East | Turkey]] [00:14:34]. The presence of US forces has "become the single greatest reason why the government in [[Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East | Damascus]] still exists" [00:15:03]. If the US were to leave, other regional powers, such as [[Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East | Turkey]] and [[Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East | Israel]], would likely intervene more directly, potentially leading to the collapse of the [[Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East | Syrian]] government within five years [00:15:16].

Such a scenario would be "bloody and horrible" because the [[Middle East]] struggles to grow its own food and relies on oil exports to buy food imports [00:15:38]. The "capacity here for an outright civilizational collapse is very, very real," and the presence of US forces is "one of the few things holding the darkness at bay" [00:15:51]. The question of whether this constitutes an [[US involvement in the Middle East and challenges in global security | American national interest]] remains open for debate [00:16:02].

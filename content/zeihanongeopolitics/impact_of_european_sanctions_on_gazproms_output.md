Gazprom, Russia's state-owned natural gas monopoly, has reported its lowest full-year output levels since 1978, a period predating the Soviet collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This significant decline is a direct result of the [[European sanctions on Russian natural gas | Europeans]]' successful efforts to reduce their dependence on Russian piped natural gas to nearly zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Dramatic Decline in Production

The effectiveness of these [[European sanctions on Russian natural gas | sanctions]] is largely due to the inherent nature of natural gas, which requires a specialized system for production, transport, and export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Any disruption in this system—be it insurance, pipes, pumps, or legalities—can halt the entire operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Unlike oil, natural gas cannot be easily redirected once supply routes are cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

The majority of Russian gas supplied to Europe originates from the Urengoy area, a field that has been in production for half a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This gas typically travels thousands of miles through pipelines via Ukraine and Belarus into countries like Poland, Germany, Slovakia, and Hungary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. When European nations ceased taking deliveries, Russia was forced to progressively shut down these operations due to the inability to reroute the gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

Exports to Europe are now down by 85% compared to the start of the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Only a trickle of gas continues to flow to the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary, nations that currently lack viable alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. These three countries have generally opposed broader sanctions and are often granted exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Dependence on Foreign Expertise

While Russia possesses other natural gas resources, such as those in Eastern Siberia (supplying China) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities on Sakhalin Island (supplying Japan) and the Yamal Peninsula (supplying Europe), these are also facing significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The Yamal LNG, Sakhalin LNG, and Kovykta field (near Lake Baikal) projects are technically demanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The construction and initial operation of these facilities were almost exclusively carried out by foreign companies, including BP, Japanese firms Mitsui and Mitsubishi, and ExxonMobil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Most of these companies have now withdrawn, cutting their losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Long-Term Technical Deficiencies

Russia lacks the necessary technical skills to maintain these complex projects independently in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Although Russia was once a leader in ice and tundra production during the Soviet era, the Soviet industrial educational system collapsed around 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Coupled with a corresponding decline in the Russian birth rate, there are now significantly fewer people who could be trained in engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. The youngest experienced petroleum engineers and reservoir managers are now in their early sixties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. For the past two decades, much of the crucial maintenance and recovery rate improvement work in areas like Urengoy was performed by foreign entities like BP, ExxonMobil, and, to a lesser extent, German and Dutch firms, all of whom have now departed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

Even if shale technologies were applied to the mature Urengoy zone, it is unlikely to resume significant production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Shale extraction requires substantial labor and is most effective near population centers, and it is ill-suited for areas that freeze solid due to the high water requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Urengoy is located thousands of miles from any major population centers, rendering such technologies impractical for its geography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This contributes to the [[Longterm prospects of Russian natural gas production | long-term challenges in the Russian natural gas industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## Remaining European Exports and Future Prospects

While some gas continues to flow to the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, this situation is expected to change as Europeans rapidly build interconnections to permanently sever ties with Russian natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. When these connections are complete, the Russian natural gas industry will be largely reduced to supplying its domestic market, with Sakhalin LNG potentially remaining active due to Japanese involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

This implies that Russia, once the world's largest producer and exporter of natural gas, could largely vanish from global markets within four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## European Mitigation Efforts

Despite the unprecedented scale of this energy shift, the price shocks felt by Europeans have been milder than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Europe has successfully imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) from alternative suppliers, primarily the Persian Gulf and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. While this has created price pressure on other traditional buyers of LNG, Europe's [[European sanctions on Russian natural gas | sanctions regime]] has effectively cut Russian income without unduly disrupting their own systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

A significant shift in geopolitical circumstances has brought to the forefront the possibility of a severe oil crash stemming from a conflict in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This scenario, previously considered unlikely due to Iran's self-interest in maintaining oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz, is now being reassessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## The Next Gulf War Scenario

The concept of a "Next Gulf War" involves a conflict where Iran and Saudi Arabia engage in hostilities, primarily driven by energy disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This scenario, previously outlined as one of the "Three Wars of the Deglobalization Period," anticipates conflicts arising as the [[shifts_in_us_foreign_policy_and_its_implications | United States steps back from global security roles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Immediate Trigger

Recent events, specifically Iran's launch of hundreds of missiles at Israel, have heightened concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Israel has indicated its intent to retaliate, explicitly shortlisting Iran's oil sector as a potential target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### Key Vulnerabilities

*   **Kharg Island:** This island serves as the sole meaningful export point for Iranian crude oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Israeli capabilities, demonstrated by their ability to neutralize Iranian air defenses around nuclear facilities in Isfahan, suggest they could devastate Iran's oil export capacity in a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Iranian Retaliation:** Should its oil exports be crippled, Iran, out of desperation, would likely seek to disrupt Saudi Arabian oil infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This could involve a military invasion targeting oil fields through southern Iraq and Kuwait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, or missile attacks on oil export and processing facilities on the western side of the Persian Gulf, particularly in Saudi Arabia's Ghawar region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Potential Oil Volume at Risk

*   Iranian exports alone account for approximately 1 million barrels per day (bpd) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   If major Gulf States, notably Saudi Arabia, are impacted, the volume at risk could increase to 10 million bpd or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   Including potential disruptions from Iraq, UAE, or Kuwait, the total could reach 20 million bpd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   Such a scenario could drive oil prices above $300 a barrel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## Varying Global Impacts

A severe oil disruption would shatter the single global oil price system, creating disparate economic outcomes across the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### United States

The [[shifts_in_us_energy_independence_and_its_global_implications | United States]] holds a unique position due to its significant domestic oil production and legislative authority:

*   **Export Ban Authority:** Since 2015, the U.S. presidency has the authority to summarily end crude oil exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Domestic Market Saturation:** With the Shale Revolution enabling several million bpd of exports, halting these exports would create a super-saturated domestic market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Price Ceiling:** This would likely create a functional oil price ceiling of $60-$70 a barrel within the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Economic Outcome:** The U.S. could "skate right on" through a global depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

#### Internal U.S. Discrepancies

*   **California Exception:** California's energy market is largely isolated from the U.S. domestic supply network due to a lack of pipeline connections to major oil fields and restrictive state regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Import Dependency:** California imports most of its crude from the Persian Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Local Impact:** This would lead to significantly higher prices on the West Coast, potentially $10 a gallon for gasoline, creating a "significant schism in the economic outcomes" even within the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

### China

China would be the most severely impacted major consumer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. It is the largest consumer of crude from Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, and Iran â€“ all sources that would be directly endangered or eliminated in such a conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### Other Producers

*   **Persian Gulf Bypass Pipelines:** Saudi Arabia and the UAE have built bypass pipelines to avoid the Strait of Hormuz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Resilience:** Roughly 5 to 6.5 million bpd could still be exported through these routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Financial Advantage:** If oil prices triple while exports are merely halved, countries like Saudi Arabia could find themselves in a net financially superior position, assuming they are not militarily conquered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## Outlook

The likelihood of this scenario occurring within the next few months is assessed to be between 1 in 4 and 1 in 3, contingent on Israeli actions and the subsequent Iranian response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. The potential disruption would be profound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

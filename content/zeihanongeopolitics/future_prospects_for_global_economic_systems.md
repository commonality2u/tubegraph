The current trajectory of globalization suggests it has "passed the point of return," influenced by shifts in U.S. foreign policy drivers, internal American politics, and significant global demographic changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This indicates a move away from the hyper-globalization era of the last 30-35 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## The Original Basis of Globalization

The United States initiated globalization not primarily for traditional economic benefits, but for security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. After World War II, despite having the world's largest economy, the U.S. faced a challenging global landscape where its potential rivals and allies combined had an economy similar in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. [[postcold_war_global_economic_system | Economic growth]] was difficult, and security was elusive due to competition over resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

The solution during the Cold War was for the U.S. to "bribe everybody" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This involved using the U.S. Navy to patrol global oceans, allowing allies universal access to materials and, crucially, to the American market, which was the only significant economy to survive the war intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. In return, these nations allowed the U.S. to dictate their security policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This strategy successfully led to the end of the Cold War, as the Soviet system could not compete with the U.S.'s security advantage and the massively larger alliance of economies it fostered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. For instance, by the 1980s, Korea, once the world's fifth poorest country, surpassed the Soviet Union in per capita terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Shifts Towards De-globalization

### Economic & Security Realities
In the hyper-globalization era that followed, many more players, including Southeast Asia, Brazil, India, Russia, and China, entered the global system under U.S.-established rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. However, the U.S. economy is no longer proportionally as large as the rest of the world combined; the global economy is now three to four times its size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This has made the U.S.'s previous indirect economic subsidization unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Some nations, like China, are heavily dependent on globalization but face severe challenges due to demographics (lack of markets), limited military reach (difficulty securing energy), and reliance on countries like Russia for raw materials, which is seen as unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### American Politics
American foreign policy is a reflection of its domestic policy, and the U.S. is currently undergoing a political shift that does not support globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Major changes over the last 35 years—the end of the Cold War, the rise and fall of hyper-globalization, Baby Boomer retirement, and the information revolution—have reshaped American politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Key factions that once supported globalization, such as unions (now largely anti-free trade) within the Democratic coalition, and the business community and national security conservatives (pro-globalization for economic and security reasons) within the Republican coalition, have either shifted allegiance or been marginalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This has created an environment where neither major party in Washington is keen to discuss globalization positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. The Biden Administration, for instance, has doubled and tripled down on tariffs from the Trump era, signaling a strong anti-globalization stance that is becoming hardwired into policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

### Global Demographics
The most significant factor driving de-globalization is demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Urbanization and industrialization, which began for much of the developing world after 1992, lead to families having fewer children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This has resulted in a global decline in the population aged 20 and under for the last two decades, now extending to those aged 40 and under <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Trade and globalization rely on consumption, but there are increasingly not enough young consumers (typically aged 45 and under, who buy homes and have children) to sustain the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

Many nations, including China and Russia, are experiencing the fastest aging in human history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Germany and Korea are not far behind, while Indonesia, India, and Brazil are aging faster than most developed nations did over the last 70 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. By 2040-2045, the average American is projected to be younger than the average Brazilian, and ten years later, younger than the average Indian, Indonesian, or Mexican <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

## [[potential_global_economic_impact_and_the_future_of_international_currency | Future Implications]]

The confluence of these factors—the U.S.'s waning interest in the security-driven global system, a domestic political environment unsupportive of globalization, and a worldwide demographic crunch leading to fewer consumers—means the existing [[global_economic_system_transformation | global economic system transformation]] is likely to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Even if the U.S. were to reconsider, it would take years to unwind current anti-globalization policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. The current global landscape suggests that any future globalized system would require a security scare significant enough to prompt the U.S. to pay for a new alliance, which the Ukraine war has not been <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. By the time any potential shift back towards a globalized system might occur (estimated six years at best), major players like China may no longer be economically viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. This suggests a future of [[economic_restructuring_in_post_globalized_world | global economic restructuring and its impacts]] away from the previous model.

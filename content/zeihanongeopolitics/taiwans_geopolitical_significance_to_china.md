Following discussions about the potential collapse of the Chinese system, a common question arises regarding whether such internal instability might lead China to initiate a diversionary war, particularly over Taiwan, to bolster public support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. While this cannot be entirely ruled out, several factors suggest it is unlikely to be a strategic move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Reasons Against a Diversionary War Over Taiwan

### Autocratic Control and Public Opinion
Unlike democracies, China is an autocracy where the CCP's control over public space and its ability to shape public opinion are immense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. In this environment, the "rally to the flag" effect seen in pluralistic societies is not as pronounced, and economic problems do not necessarily lead to the same level of instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The government's capacity to stir nationalism is already robust, sometimes even requiring containment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Therefore, a war may not be necessary for legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Severe Economic Repercussions
Any Chinese official capable of understanding geography and economics would recognize that a war for Taiwan would have catastrophic consequences for China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Energy Dependence:** China relies on the [[dependence_of_chinas_economy_on_international_trade | international community]] for approximately three-quarters of its energy sources, much of which comes from distant continents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Trade Dependence:** China is the world's most dependent country in terms of absolute volumes for imports and exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Food Security:** The vast majority of materials needed to grow food are imported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Even a moderate effort by a small number of countries to disrupt Chinese commerce in the aftermath of a war would lead to [[chinas_industrial_and_political_challenges | industrial collapse]] within months and potentially result in famine for half the population within a couple of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The Chinese leadership is believed to have understood these risks for years, primarily using Taiwan as a rhetorical issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Limited Strategic Gain
Even if China could capture Taiwan quickly and with minimal damage, the strategic gains would be limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Continued International Dependence:** China would remain dependent on the international system for its needs and on the U.S. Navy for patrolling global oceans to ensure commercial cargo flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Increased Naval Risk:** Capturing Taiwan could paradoxically increase the risk to Chinese shipping by exposing it to the longer-range Japanese Navy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Semiconductor Industry:** While Taiwan is home to advanced semiconductor facilities, China lacks the foreign equipment, software, and personnel required to operate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Taking control of these facilities would likely take China over a decade to operate effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## Reasons a War *Could* Still Happen

Despite the strategic disadvantages, a war over Taiwan is not impossible, though the underlying rationale would be different from conventional expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### Xi Jinping's Miscalculation
Xi Jinping has cultivated a cult of personality that severely limits the flow of information to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. He is making decisions in isolation, potentially without an accurate understanding of global realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. In such a decision-making structure, a war could be triggered by Xi's personal miscalculation rather than any traditional economic, strategic, or political motive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### A Desperate Move by the CCP
A darker possibility exists if one believes the [[political_and_social_instability_in_china | Chinese system]] is facing an inevitable collapse over the next decade due to demographic, economic, and other vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. If there is nothing the Chinese government can do to prevent industrial and population collapse, then initiating a war, even one certain to result in the death of half the country's population, could be seen as a means for the CCP to command the narrative and potentially rule into the next era of Chinese history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. While amoral, this could be a compelling, albeit devastating, reason to launch a war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

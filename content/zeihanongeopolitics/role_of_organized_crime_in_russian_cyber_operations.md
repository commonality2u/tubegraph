The nature of [[Russian cyber crime and hacking | Russian cyber crime]] differs significantly from other nations, with a substantial portion of its cyber capacity residing within private, [[russias_organized_crime_and_government_connections | organized crime]] groups rather than solely state agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## Structure of Russian Cyber Capacity

While there is a state agency involved in Russian cyber operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, alongside a "bot arm" that engages with various groups like religious fanatics, environmental activists, and anti-vaxxers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a> (e.g., concerning nuclear power, COVID conspiracies, or "Blue Lives Matter"/"Black Lives Matter" protests) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, the majority of the nation's cyber strength comes from private entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. These are primarily [[russias_organized_crime_and_government_connections | organized crime]] groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## Activities of Criminal Cyber Groups

These [[russias_organized_crime_and_government_connections | organized crime]] groups focus on activities such as cracking credit cards, gaining control of bank accounts, or shutting down hospitals for ransom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This represents a distinct system compared to state-centric cyber operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## Impact of the Ukraine War

At the onset of the war, it became apparent that the actual state power in Russia was less than previously estimated, while its overall cyber capability, bolstered by these private groups, was more significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. However, [[russias_organized_crime_and_government_connections | crime-oriented cyber groups]] lack the defensive capabilities of state-sponsored entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Early in the conflict, the Biden administration unofficially targeted and significantly disrupted many of these groups using U.S. cyber capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This action has since made it challenging for Russian cyber operations to extend beyond minor attacks on Ukrainian or Western systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

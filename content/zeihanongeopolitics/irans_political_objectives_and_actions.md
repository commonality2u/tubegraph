On April 14th, Iran launched its largest ever assault from another country into Israel since the 1970s wars ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This [[iranian_attack_on_israel | Iranian attack on Israel]] involved over 300 missiles, drones, and an assortment of artillery rockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Some projectiles were launched from Iran proper, some from Yemen via the [[irans_support_for_houthi_forces | Houthis]], some from proxies in Syria, and artillery and some rockets from Hezbollah in Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Motivations and Strategic Approach

The stated reason for the attack was in response to Israel targeting embassy property in Damascus, which resulted in the elimination of several senior paramilitary commanders Iran would have preferred not to lose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

However, the assault was described as the "biggest piece of political theater of the Year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Minutes after the launches, the Iranian government issued an official proclamation, both directly from Tehran and via its UN office, stating that their objectives had been achieved and that the situation was "all over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Limited Interest in Gaza
Iran has publicly referred to Hamas as "animals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The country has no inherent interests in Gaza or in many of the actions they've directed towards Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Instead, their involvement, particularly regarding Gaza, has been a method to "needle the Israelis" while Israel is focused on other matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Avoiding Escalation
Iran's primary political objective for this specific attack appears to be saving face after the loss of senior commanders, rather than initiating a broader conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The assault was highly telegraphed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Iran announced their plans for several days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Furthermore, the Swiss Embassy, which handles diplomatic communications between the United States and Iran, was actively engaged by Iran, which disclosed the types of weapons they would use, their launch locations, and flight paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

This communication allowed Israel and its allies (including Jordan, the United States, and the United Kingdom) to intercept nearly all projectiles, ensuring minimal damage and preventing the need for further retaliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Following the attack, Iran is hoping that its declaration of having achieved its goals will be accepted, leading to a cessation of hostilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

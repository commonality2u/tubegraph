The production of [[challenges_facing_ev_production_and_adoption | electric vehicles]] (EVs) faces significant challenges, including the intensive material requirements and associated supply chain issues. Major auto manufacturers like Ford and GM have scaled down their EV production plans, and Tesla has indicated a draw down in global production capacity and a potential suspension of their Gigafactory plans in Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This reassessment stems from various issues, particularly those related to the materials needed for EV fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Exotic Materials and Energy-Intensive Processing

EVs require "an order of magnitude more stuff" than internal combustion engine vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This includes a higher quantity of exotic materials such as copper, molybdenum, [[lithium_processing_and_supply_chain_requirements | lithium]], and graphite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. The processing of these materials is significantly more energy-intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

Most of this fabrication work for EV components is performed in [[chinas_import_dependency_on_energy_and_materials | China]], predominantly using soft coal or lignite for energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This results in an order of magnitude more carbon being generated just to manufacture an EV compared to an internal combustion vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Consequently, these vehicles typically do not break even on carbon emissions for nearly 10 years or more, even when using Chinese data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Global Material Scarcity

A fundamental problem for widespread EV adoption is the insufficient availability of these required materials on the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Converting the world's vehicle fleets to EVs would require a massive increase in the production of materials like nickel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

Historically, humanity has never doubled the production of any industrial material within a 10-year period if it was already in use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The scale of material extraction and processing needed for a global EV fleet is currently measured in decades, potentially a century or more, making rapid conversion unrealistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Infrastructure and Supply Chain Limitations

Beyond the vehicles themselves, establishing a nationwide EV program in the United States would necessitate increasing electricity generation and throughput by roughly half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This requires an enormous increase in equipment, such as transformers and cables, estimated at about 20 times more than what has been produced in the last 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Even if facilities to produce this equipment were started today, they would not be ready at scale for four years, and the full buildout would take another decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Market Demand and Profitability Issues

Ultimately, the [[issues_with_ev_infrastructure_and_market_demand | market demand]] for EVs is slowing down due to issues like reliability, range anxiety, and the relatively high [[cost_and_economic_factors_in_the_ev_market | cost]] compared to internal combustion vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Unsold EVs are accumulating on dealer lots, unlike internal combustion cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Massive discounts are now required to sell them, rendering the entire EV industry unprofitable even with subsidies from the Inflation Reduction Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

With only 1% of the American vehicle fleet converted to EVs, the current peak of adoption may be near <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Given limited capital, resources, material inputs, and labor, it is argued that focus should shift to green transition technologies that are more viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

The speaker discusses the deterioration of Twitter as a platform, primarily due to the rise of misinformation and changes in its management.

## Initial Utility of Twitter

Previously, Twitter was valued for providing access to firsthand information from areas or situations that mainstream media might not cover or reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21"></a>. An example cited is the Ukraine War, where individuals with personal contacts on the front lines could share information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04"></a>. Although such information required vetting, it served as a crucial source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11"></a>.

Prior to [[changes_in_twitters_content_moderation | Elon Musk]]'s acquisition, the old Twitter management purged Russian bots from the system, which significantly reduced the spamming of disinformation and made the platform "glorious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15"></a>.

## Deterioration Under New Management

However, with [[criticism_of_elon_musks_management_of_twitter | Elon Musk]]'s takeover, content moderation was dismantled in the name of free speech, leading to an encouragement and return of bots in force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30"></a>. This change has resulted in the speaker's curated feed being 90-95% misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42"></a>. What used to be an hour or two of browsing for understanding now takes twelve hours and yields no comprehension due to the overwhelming "crap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51"></a>.

> "I've gone from spending an hour or two thumbing through Twitter getting a feel of what's going on in the world to spending 12 hours and having no idea what's going on because it's just crap so I've stopped." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47"></a>

### Decline in Interactivity and Engagement

A significant [[challenges_facing_credible_news_consumption | challenge]] has been the collapse of [[interactivity_and_user_engagement_on_twitter | interaction]] with legitimate users. The "For You" category, meant for personalized content, has largely disappeared from the speaker's feed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33"></a>. Over a six-week period, the speaker experienced only seven interactions with all followers combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37"></a>. Conversely, spam, pornbots, and crypto schemes are easily able to penetrate the feed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46"></a>. This shift has transformed Twitter from a rewarding professional tool into a "time suck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57"></a>.

### Leadership and Propaganda

The speaker also criticizes [[criticism_of_elon_musks_management_of_twitter | Elon Musk]] directly for propagating various forms of propaganda. Initially, it was Chinese, then Russian, and Iranian propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09"></a>. More recently, [[criticism_of_elon_musks_management_of_twitter | Musk]] has promoted white supremacist and anti-semitic viewpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23"></a>.

## Conclusion

Due to these issues, the speaker is personally [[reasons_for_leaving_twitter | leaving Twitter]] for content consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12"></a>. While Twitter will still be used as a distribution channel for videos, particularly for those who can still find use for it, such as "Crypt Bros," the most reliable way to access content is directly through the newsletter at Zeihan.com/newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43"></a>. Despite the current deterioration, the speaker occasionally checks Twitter for any positive changes, though the platform has consistently worsened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22"></a>.

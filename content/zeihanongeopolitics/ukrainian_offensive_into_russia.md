The [[ukrainian_incursion_into_russian_territory | Ukrainian offensive]] has advanced through Ukraine's northern border into Russia proper, specifically targeting the Kursk Province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This action has initiated a "war of movement" with Russian forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Battlefield Dynamics

Both sides are incurring heavy losses, with Ukrainians reportedly taking "heavy casualties" and Russians experiencing "astronomical casualties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. A key Ukrainian tactic has been the destruction of bridges across the S River, effectively cutting off support for Russian forces positioned south of the river and north of the Ukrainian border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The Ukrainians are described as "having a pretty good time of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Strategic Advances

Ukraine has moved long-range missiles, mortars, and drones close to the border, launching strikes up to 100 miles into Russian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. These strikes are "gutting the logistics infrastructure" in the southern and western parts of Kursk Province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

The northern front of the conflict has largely shifted into Russian territory, marking a significant change in battlefield realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. If Ukraine can maintain this pressure, they aim to sever the logistical infrastructure connecting Kursk City and Belgorod City, which is crucial for supplying Russian forces on the northern front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The success in Kursk is partly attributed to Ukraine's ability to create a war of maneuver in an area without minefields, allowing for greater freedom of movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Current Status

The Kursk region is considered "in play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. The situation is highly dynamic, and further changes to the front line are anticipated in the coming month, potentially more than in the last couple of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

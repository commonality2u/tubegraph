From: [[zeihanongeopolitics]] <br/> 

The ongoing conflict is primarily a fight between [[hamas_attacks_on_israel | Hamas]] and Israel, with no other significant regional players becoming involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The major players have indicated their stances through both action and inaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## [[egypts_stance_on_the_gaza_conflict | Egypt's Stance]]

Egypt is considered the most critical player who could influence the conflict's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Israelis had hoped to persuade international bodies like the United States and United Nations that the conflict's resolution involved moving all Gazans from the strip into temporary camps in the Sinai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This proposition, which reflects an Israeli goal of moving Palestinians since 1948, or at least since 1973, was not accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

Egypt was the most vocal in its objection to this idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The Egyptians are generally opposed to even allowing aid into Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Between 1948 and 1973, Egypt controlled Gaza, a period described as difficult for all involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Egypt's only desired outcome for Palestinians crossing into Egyptian territory is "in coffins or preferably dump trucks full of bodies," indicating a complete lack of intent to provide assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## [[hezbollahs_position_on_the_israel_hamas_conflict | Hezbollah's Position]]

Hezbollah, a Shiite Arab militia operating primarily out of Southern Lebanon, was another group concerning many observers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. They have a history of confrontations with Israel, possess a powerful paramilitary force, and have launched rockets into Israeli cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

Despite a fiery speech from their leader, Hassan Nasrallah, encouraging "resistance" against Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, Hezbollah has opted to remain out of the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Hezbollah has a lot to lose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, and the [[hamas_attacks_on_israel | Hamas]] operation was conducted without any coordination with Hezbollah, meaning they are not prepared to join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Even if they were prepared, it is doubted they would engage due to differing backers, religious affiliations, and strategic approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Hezbollah has achieved many of its objectives over the past 50 years, including gaining a significant role in the Lebanese government in Beirut, a position they are unwilling to jeopardize for a conflict they did not initiate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## [[irans_approach_to_the_israel_hamas_situation | Iran's Approach]]

Iran, a sponsor and ally of Hezbollah, is the third country whose involvement was closely watched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Like Hezbollah, Iran's Supreme Leader delivered a speech condemning the occupation and Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, but also indicating that Iran would only reciprocate if directly attacked by Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

Iran is engaging in low-risk actions, such as "pot shots" via proxies in Syria against American bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. However, CENTCOM, responsible for American operations in the region, has reported no significant casualties or damage from these attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. This limits the need for a military response from the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Iran is unwilling to risk a broader confrontation with the American Navy in the Gulf, which is vital for their trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Iran has publicly denounced Hamas as "apostates and animals" worthy of destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, suggesting that while they may have influenced the timing of the [[hamas_attacks_on_israel | Hamas]] operation, they are not prepared to sacrifice their own interests for the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

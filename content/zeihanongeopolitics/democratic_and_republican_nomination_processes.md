Understanding the distinct nomination processes within the [[republican_and_democratic_party_factions | Republican]] and Democratic parties is crucial for predicting the outcome of the next [[2024_us_presidential_election_predictions | presidential election]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Republican Nomination Process

The [[republican_and_democratic_party_factions | Republican Party's]] nomination process is characterized by a "winner take all" mentality when it comes to delegates in most races <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. If a candidate secures just one more vote than the second-place contender, they win every single delegate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Donald Trump's Influence
[[donald_trump | Donald Trump]] is described as having a "cult following" within the [[republican_and_democratic_party_factions | Republican Party]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Between one-quarter and one-third of self-identified Republicans are unconcerned by his actions or statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This dedicated base makes it easy for him to win the nomination if multiple candidates run against him, as the vote becomes sufficiently split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

Trump was able to come "from the outside" and mobilize a populist group of people who had been left out, catapulting him to the presidency and control of the [[republican_and_democratic_party_factions | Republican Party]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. With at least three other candidates already declared for the presidency, even if someone like Florida Governor DeSantis runs, the vote is already too split for Trump to lose the nomination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The [[republican_and_democratic_party_factions | Republican]] nomination is seen as "hardwired in" for Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Democratic Nomination Process

The [[republican_and_democratic_party_factions | Democratic Party]] selects its candidates differently, without a "winner take all" delegate system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. If there are strong candidates, the delegate count is broken up among them, often leading to decisions being made at the convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### The Role of Super Delegates
A significant factor in the Democratic process is the presence of "super delegates" at the convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. These individuals are not chosen through primaries or caucuses but represent the party's institutional core, which is primarily centrist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

In the last presidential cycle, super delegates played a crucial role when it appeared [[bernie_sanders | Bernie Sanders]] might secure the [[republican_and_democratic_party_factions | Democratic]] nomination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Centrist and center-left Democrats "rallied together" and used the party apparatus to ensure [[bernie_sanders | Bernie Sanders]] did not get the nomination, which allowed [[joe_biden | Biden]] to "squeak through" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### Preventing a Sanders Nomination
The centrists within the [[republican_and_democratic_party_factions | Democratic Coalition]] have decided they will not allow a repeat of the previous situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. When [[bernie_sanders | Bernie Sanders]] decides to run again, centrists are expected to act swiftly to prevent his nomination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Lack of a Deep Bench
The Democratic Party has faced a challenge over the last 25 years in bringing in new talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Charismatic figures at the top, like [[joe_biden | Biden]], Pelosi, and Schumer, who are in their 70s, dominate the scene and make it difficult for younger, up-and-coming politicians to enter the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This lack of a "deep bench" makes it hard to have a truly competitive primary system, sometimes leading to "freaks" like [[bernie_sanders | Bernie Sanders]] emerging from the outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

Given that the centrists have already decided their course of action, [[joe_biden | Biden]] is seen as a "shoe-in" for the Democratic nomination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Implications for the General Election

The outcomes of these nomination processes suggest a rematch of the last [[2024_us_presidential_election_predictions | election]]: [[joe_biden | Biden]] versus [[donald_trump | Trump]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This scenario is expected unless [[joe_biden | Biden]] experiences a significant public "meltdown" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Issues such as the candidates' age or the choice of Vice President are considered unlikely to significantly impact the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

Roughly 20-25% of the electorate are hardcore [[republican_and_democratic_party_factions | Republican]] or [[republican_and_democratic_party_factions | Democrat]] and will vote for their party's candidate regardless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Another 20% on each side identify as [[role_of_independents_in_us_politics | independent]], but consistently vote for one party, acting as "subsidiaries" of the left or right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

The truly [[role_of_independents_in_us_politics | independent voters in American elections]], making up only about 10% of the electorate, are the decisive factor in [[impact_of_independents_in_elections | general elections]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. In the 2022 midterms, despite disliking [[joe_biden | Biden]]'s economic policies, these [[independent_voters_in_american_elections | independent voters]] decisively sided with Democrats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. This was because they perceived that the [[republican_and_democratic_party_factions | Republican Party]] under [[donald_trump | Trump]] aimed to change the [[us_electoral_system_and_its_effect_on_political_parties | electoral system]] in a way that would render swing voters and [[independent_voters_in_american_elections | independent voters]] powerless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. [[donald_trump | Trump]]'s emphasis on "personal loyalty" also led to "crap candidates" who were easy to vote against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

Therefore, if [[independent_voters_in_american_elections | independents]] were willing to vote against their economic interests in the midterms, they are expected to show up for the [[2024_us_presidential_election_predictions | general election]] and vote against [[donald_trump | Trump]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. This perspective leads to the prediction that [[joe_biden | Biden]] will win re-election, provided he does not die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

### Foreign Policy Alignment
A potential consequence of this predicted outcome is the first extended period of agreement in U.S. foreign policy across administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. While Obama had little foreign policy action due to his lack of engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, and [[donald_trump | Trump]] would tweet policies without implementing them constructively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>, [[joe_biden | Biden]] shares [[donald_trump | Trump]]'s populist and nationalist approach to foreign economic policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. The key difference is that [[joe_biden | Biden]] believes in government and can "sit through a meeting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. He has been systematically turning [[donald_trump | Trump]]'s tweets into foreign economic policy and embedding them into governance and bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

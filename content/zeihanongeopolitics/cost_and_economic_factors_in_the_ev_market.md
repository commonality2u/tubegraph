Major auto manufacturers are significantly scaling down their plans for electric vehicle (EV) production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Both Ford and GM have cancelled or suspended plans for new battery and EV assembly facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Tesla has also indicated a significant reduction in global production capacity and is considering suspending or cancelling its planned gigafactory in Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This shift is attributed to multiple [[issues_with_ev_infrastructure_and_market_demand | issues in play]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Production and Environmental Costs

The [[environmental_impact_of_electric_vehicles | environmental impact of EVs]] is questioned, as data suggesting they are "slam dunk successes" often assumes manufacturing with clean energy and recharging with 100% green energy, which is not the reality in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For instance, even California, the cleanest state, still relies on 50% fossil fuel energy, and a significant portion of its imported power (about a third of total demand) is 100% fossil fuel-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

On the manufacturing side, EVs require more exotic materials and energy-intensive processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Much of this work is done in China, using soft coal or lignite, leading to an order of magnitude more carbon generated during production compared to internal combustion (IC) vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This means EVs often take nearly a decade or more to break even on carbon emissions, assuming Chinese data is accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Material and Infrastructure Constraints

EVs require significantly more [[material_requirements_for_ev_manufacturing | materials]] like copper, lithium, and graphite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The energy required to process these materials contributes heavily to the overall energy cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. There is a global shortage of these materials, making it difficult to convert the world's vehicle fleets to EVs within a short timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Humanity has never doubled the production of any industrial material within a 10-year period if it was already in use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The transition to EVs on a global scale would likely take a century or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

Furthermore, the existing electrical grid cannot support a nationwide EV program without substantial upgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. The amount of electricity generation and throughput needs to increase by about half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This would require a buildout of infrastructure on a scale not seen since the 1950s, demanding 20 times more equipment like transformers and cables than in the last 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Building the facilities for such equipment would take at least four years to be ready at scale, and then the actual grid buildout would take another decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## High Costs and Declining Demand

The cost of EVs remains a significant barrier for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Even the cheapest EVs cost about $10,000 more than their equivalent internal combustion engine (ICE) counterparts, with more expensive models upwards of $70,000 more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This makes EVs unattainable for most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

Consumers are also facing [[issues_with_ev_infrastructure_and_market_demand | range anxiety]] due to a lack of charging stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Overall, sales are down as people are less interested in EVs at the current time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Concerns about reliability and the rapid pace of technological change mean consumers are unwilling to pay today's prices for potentially outdated EV technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This has led to EVs accumulating on dealership lots, unlike ICE cars which are selling out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

To move inventory, massive discounts are now necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. These discounts have rendered the entire EV industry unprofitable, even with subsidies from the Inflation Reduction Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

### Limited Adoption
Currently, only 1% of the American vehicle fleet has converted to EVs, and it appears the market may be reaching its peak adoption rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

> "We have limited [[capital_availability_and_its_effects_on_technology_development | Capital]], we have limited resources, we have limited material inputs and we have limited labor and we really need to focus on the technologies of the green transition that work and this isn't one of them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

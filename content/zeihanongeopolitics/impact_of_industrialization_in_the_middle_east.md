The [[history_of_middle_eastern_geopolitics_and_trade | Middle East]] has undergone significant transformations due to industrialization, particularly in the 20th century. Historically, for roughly 500 years, the region was considered a "Backwater" by Western powers, largely bypassed after the development of deep-water navigation allowed direct trade between Europe and East Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:06">[03:05:06]</a>. This period saw the West industrialize while the [[Middle East geopolitics and oil reliance | Middle East]] did not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:15">[03:22:15]</a>.

## Pre-Industrial Landscape
From approximately 1000 AD to 1500 AD, the [[history_of_middle_eastern_geopolitics and trade | Middle East]] served as a crucial intermediary for trade between more technologically advanced societies in the West and East Asia, facilitating the movement of goods like spices, porcelain, and silks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. This trade, conducted via coastal vessels, camels, and caravans, involved numerous middlemen, leading to product costs increasing by a factor of a thousand or so in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>, transforming everyday Eastern goods into Western luxuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

The relative lack of rainfall across most of the [[Middle East geopolitics and oil reliance | Middle East]], concentrating water sources along coasts or rivers, historically facilitated the rise of political authorities that could dominate and reduce populations to "slave status" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:49">[03:47:49]</a>. This environment did not foster stability or economic advancement among the general population, leading to a static technological level compared to the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. While centers of learning preserved Western knowledge, it was not applied or disseminated within their own cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. Once the West developed industrial technologies, gunpowder, and cannons, the [[Middle East geopolitics and oil reliance | Middle East]] was left far behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. This technological disparity allowed Western countries like Britain and France to carve up the region into mandates and colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

## Post-1900s: The [[petroleums_role_in_modern_middle_eastern_importance | Role of Oil]] and Modern Industrialization
The [[Middle East geopolitics and oil reliance | Middle East]] regained its global significance after the 1900s, primarily due to the discovery of oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. Oil became an essential asset for industrial economies to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>, particularly for Europe after Russian crude was removed from their energy equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>.

### Shifting Dynamics
After 1950, the environment in the [[Middle East geopolitics and oil reliance | Middle East]] changed dramatically. The introduction of industrial technologies led to the construction of roads, drilling operations, and the acquisition of military hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:57">[07:32:57]</a>. This meant that the region was no longer "non-industrialized" as it had been from 1900 to 1950 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. Groups like ISIS in Syria could easily acquire explosives and AK-47s, making the region a much more complex and dangerous environment for external powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.

### Governance and Societal Impact
Industrialization altered the nature of governance in the [[Middle East geopolitics and oil reliance | Middle East]]. Previously characterized by "Fortress political systems" (e.g., Damascus, Egypt, Iran) that were geographically difficult to conquer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>, the new technologies created brittle, top-down, concentrated political systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. These systems, largely fueled by oil revenues, proved incapable of providing technological progress or stability for their populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>. The result was weakened societies and a proliferation of militant groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>, leading to societal breakdown in places like Egypt, Iraq, and Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.

## US Engagement and its Complexities
Following the 9/11 attacks, the United States intervened in the [[Middle East geopolitics and oil reliance | Middle East]]. The strategy in Iraq, while initially successful in pressuring regional powers to target Al-Qaeda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>, failed to establish a stable, Western-style nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>. This was because the region lacks the foundational societal structures to form a country in the way Americans or Westerners understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>.

The continued presence of US forces, even in reduced numbers, contributes to what are termed "forever wars" â€“ conflicts aimed at preventing the resurgence of specific types of militancy rather than defeating a particular group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>. Despite the desire to leave, withdrawal risks the rapid emergence of more militant groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a>.

Interestingly, the US presence in the region has become a key factor in the survival of governments like Damascus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a>. If the US were to withdraw, regional powers like Turkey and Syria would likely intervene more aggressively to deal with militant groups, potentially leading to the collapse of the Syrian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>. The [[geopolitical_tensions_in_the_middle_east | Middle East]], unable to grow sufficient food and relying on energy exports to import food, faces a very real risk of outright civilizational collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:00">[15:42:00]</a>. The presence of US forces is acknowledged as one of the few things "holding the Darkness at Bay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>.

The recent federal elections have prompted a re-evaluation of previous political predictions and reveal significant shifts in American political dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Historically, elections, especially at the presidential level, have been decided by a small sliver of "true Independents" (5-10% of the population) who switch sides frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>. This group has been decisive in putting various presidents into office, including Obama, W, Biden, and Trump, and also in removing Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.

In the 2022 midterms, [[Potential Issues with Donald Trumps Influence in Future Elections | Donald Trump]]'s rhetoric, suggesting independent votes didn't matter and decisions should be made at the primary level, provoked a strong response from true Independents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. This resulted in Democrats winning almost all races where [[Potential Issues with Donald Trumps Influence in Future Elections | Donald Trump]] had direct influence, turning an anticipated "red wave" into a "red fizzle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. It was anticipated that Independents would continue this trend in 2024, breaking strongly against [[Potential Issues with Donald Trumps Influence in Future Elections | Trump]] for a third consecutive election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. Initial exit poll data suggests this prediction for Independents largely held true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

However, the significant surprise was that other traditional voter groups shifted their allegiances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

## The Fading Democratic Coalition

The traditional Democratic alliance, built on three pillars—Coastal, primarily white, college-educated elites; minorities; and organized labor—experienced substantial erosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. Key shifts observed include:
*   Unmarried women shifting to [[Potential Issues with Donald Trumps Influence in Future Elections | Trump]] by 5 points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.
*   Youth (18-29 year olds), typically Democratic voters, breaking towards [[Potential Issues with Donald Trumps Influence in Future Elections | Trump]] by 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.
*   Black men going to [[Potential Issues with Donald Trumps Influence in Future Elections | Trump]] by 7% more than before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.
*   Non-white college graduates shifting by 9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.
*   Asians by 11% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.
*   People in the lower income bracket (30-49%) broke 12% for [[Potential Issues with Donald Trumps Influence in Future Elections | Trump]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.
*   Latinos shifted by 17%, with Latino men specifically moving 22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

Organized labor is now, at best, a swing vote for Democrats, with over half voting for [[Potential Issues with Donald Trumps Influence in Future Elections | Trump]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>. Furthermore, Hispanics, the fastest-growing demographic largely due to immigration, are significantly opposed to migration in any form, making [[Potential Issues with Donald Trumps Influence in Future Elections | Donald Trump]]'s southern border rhetoric resonate with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>. The loss of Hispanic and organized labor support from the Democratic alliance means that the party, primarily composed of "white Coastal educated Elites," is reduced to a "book club" incapable of winning federal elections without significant alignment shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.

## The Rise of a New Party (Maga)

The political landscape is undergoing a significant realignment with party loyalties shifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>. A new party is being born, characterized by its alignment with Maga, distinct from the traditional Republican party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. However, this new alignment's permanence is still uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

## The Looming Constitutional Crisis

A [[potential_constitutional_crisis_with_leadership_changes | constitutional crisis]] is anticipated in the next couple of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. The analyst suggests that [[Potential Issues with Donald Trumps Influence in Future Elections | Donald Trump]] is perceived as "failing" and, being older than Joe Biden was at the start of his presidency, the chance of [[Potential Issues with Donald Trumps Influence in Future Elections | Trump]] serving a full term without a significant cognitive decline is "vanishingly small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.

Unlike Joe Biden, who had a circle of peers and confidants to offer truth and guidance, [[Potential Issues with Donald Trumps Influence in Future Elections | Donald Trump]] has cultivated a "cult of personality" within the Maga party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>. He has purged individuals who might challenge him, and his new cabinet is expected to exclude anyone who previously offered dissent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. This includes figures like Mike Pompeo and Nikki Haley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.

The challenge arises in how to address a president who has lost mental capacity but refuses to leave office, as the country has "never been in this situation before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. This represents both a constitutional crisis for the nation and a [[leadership_crisis_in_the_canadian_liberal_party | leadership crisis]] for the Maga movement, as [[Potential Issues with Donald Trumps Influence in Future Elections | Trump]] is central to its identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>.

## Outlook

The confluence of factors including voter apathy (evident in a 10% drop in participation between 2020 and 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>, the demise of the Democratic coalition without a clear replacement, and the anticipated challenges related to [[Potential Issues with Donald Trumps Influence in Future Elections | Donald Trump]]'s leadership and the lack of a clear successor within Maga, suggests a "lively time" ahead for the American political landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.

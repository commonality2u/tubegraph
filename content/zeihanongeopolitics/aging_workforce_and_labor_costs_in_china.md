New data released through the U.N. from the Chinese government indicates a severe demographic situation in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Fastest Aging Workforce in History

The data shows a significant narrowing in the bottom seven age blocks of China's population, indicating the fastest aging workforce in the world, and arguably the fastest in human history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This demographic shift means the number of new workers entering the labor force is significantly smaller than the number of individuals retiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Soaring Labor Costs

As a direct consequence of this rapid aging, China is experiencing a massive increase in labor costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Trusted adjacent data confirms that Chinese labor costs are rising at the fastest pace of any country in any era, including during historical events like the Black Death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Since 2000, the cost of Chinese labor has increased by approximately 15 times, while the overall size of the [[chinas_demographic_challenges_and_economic_growth | Chinese economy]] has only expanded by a factor of roughly 3.5 to 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Currently, China functions as an industrial power primarily due to the sunk cost of its existing industrial plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. However, many industries that have relocated from China to other countries have found shorter, simpler supply chains and reduced political headaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Underlying Demographic Collapse

The number of children under age 5 in China has collapsed, with roughly twice as many individuals aged 15 as those under 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. A sudden 40% collapse in the birth rate occurred around 2017 among the ethnic Han population, and over 50% among many minority groups, even before the impact of COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Anecdotal evidence suggests birth rates dropped further during the pandemic, and death rates likely rose considerably, though reliable data on COVID-related deaths from China is unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

Despite official state data, the Shanghai Academy of Sciences suggests that China has overcounted its population under age 45 by over 100 million people following the one-child policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Advanced Stages of Demographic Collapse

According to internal estimates based on these realities, China likely passed the point of [[demographic_challenges_facing_china | demographic no return]] over 20 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. India probably became the world's most populous country a decade ago, not just recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Furthermore, the average Chinese citizen likely aged past the average American around 2007 or 2008, not 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

This indicates that China is not merely in demographic decay, but in the advanced stages of [[demographic_and_economic_challenges_facing_china | demographic collapse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This decade may be the last in which China can function as a modern industrialized nation-state, as it will simply lack the necessary population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Implications for Businesses

For businesses operating in China, the challenges extend beyond political issues, such as the illegality of foreigners accessing certain data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. The labor force will never recover, meaning current labor costs are as low as they will ever be, and consumption is as high as it will ever be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Even without considering political complications, operating environment issues, energy access, geopolitical risk, or regulatory risk, the demographic numbers simply no longer support business operations in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. While the sunk cost of industrial plants might keep some businesses there, this factor becomes less relevant with each passing year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

Canada, facing a significant [[Canadas_immigration_strategy_and_demographics | demographic decline]] similar to countries like Germany, Italy, or Korea as recently as 20 years ago, opted for a unique approach to address its population challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Unlike others, Canada chose a pro-[[challenges_posed_by_canadas_immigration_policies | immigration]] strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Demographic Challenges and Immigration Strategy

Over about 15 years, Canada welcomed approximately 4 million migrants, accounting for more than 10% of its total population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. A notable aspect of this [[challenges_posed_by_canadas_immigration_policies | immigration]] wave is that most new arrivals were under the age of 35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This contrasts with previous [[challenges_posed_by_canadas_immigration_policies | immigration]] patterns where many arrived in their 50s, becoming liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The current strategy aims for immigrants to contribute as workers and consumers for decades, paying into the system before potentially becoming a liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This approach has significantly changed the [[Canadas_immigration_strategy_and_demographics | demographic of Canada]], as these individuals have often already completed primary and secondary education and are ready to enter the workforce, spend, and pay taxes upon arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Impact on Housing Market

While demographically beneficial, this influx of immigrants presents a complication: they require housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Since these newcomers generally do not intend to return to their countries of origin, they are willing to pay what is necessary to secure a place to live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This demand has significantly driven up housing costs in Canada's major gateway cities, including Montreal, Vancouver, and Toronto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The impact has even extended to secondary cities like Winnipeg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Resulting Social Tensions

The rising housing costs and the rapid demographic shifts have contributed to increased social tension across Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. While the country has not seen the same level of nativist sentiments observed in many other parts of the world, the tension is nonetheless notable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

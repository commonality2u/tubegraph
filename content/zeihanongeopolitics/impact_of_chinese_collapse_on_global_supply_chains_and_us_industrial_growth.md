Recent information from China suggests a broad-scale societal, economic, and political breakdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. Key indicators of this decline include:
*   **Economic Downturn**
    *   Reduced consumer spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a> and lending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.
    *   Atrocious youth unemployment, leading to a cessation of data collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:29">[00:38:29]</a>.
    *   Disappearance of information on bond transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a> and patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>, signaling a departure from goals of economic restructuring and moving up the value-added scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>.
*   **Political Instability**
    *   The foreign minister went missing and was dismissed, with the same now occurring for the defense minister and head of missile forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.

While these issues seem sudden, they have been developing for years, only recently becoming obvious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>.

## Reasons for Delayed Global Recognition

The global community has been slow to recognize the severity of China's situation due to several factors:
*   **External Distractions**
    *   Major global events like the Ukraine war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:48">[01:52:48]</a>, Iranian conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:33">[01:54:33]</a>, the Trump Administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:49">[01:56:49]</a>, and internal US focus under the Biden Administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:39">[01:58:39]</a> have preoccupied international attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:06">[02:13:06]</a>.
    *   Europe was managing its financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:52">[02:03:52]</a>, and Japan was focused on remilitarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:05">[02:09:05]</a>.
*   **Internal Chinese Factors**
    *   **COVID-19 as a Cover**: For three years, any negative statistical release or news from China was attributed to COVID-19, masking underlying issues like consumption decline, supply chain problems, and industrial production linkages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:03">[02:27:03]</a>. This means a clear picture of China's economic health is only now emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:13">[02:53:13]</a>.
    *   **Xi Jinping's Purges and Information Vacuum**: Chairman Xi initiated purges under the guise of an anti-corruption campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:22">[03:00:22]</a>. He removed regional power centers to prevent national prominence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:49">[03:08:49]</a>, gutted factions of previous presidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:48">[03:14:48]</a>, and spent recent years dismantling bureaucrats and the private sector to prevent rivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:44">[03:23:44]</a>. This has led to the removal of certain data collection, such as college dissertation information and political biographies, to suppress alternative paths to prominence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. This created an information vacuum across China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:54">[04:00:54]</a>.

## The Underlying Demographic Crisis

The fundamental issue driving [[chinas_potential_collapse_and_its_impact_on_global_industry | China's potential collapse]] is demographic.
*   **Birth Rate Collapse**: The birth rate has plummeted by nearly 70% since 2017, the fastest drop in recorded human history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:10">[04:29:10]</a>.
*   **Overcounted Population and Workforce Decline**: The Shanghai Academy of Sciences suggests China has overcounted its population by more than 100 million people, all of whom would have been working-age individuals under 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:48">[04:44:48]</a>. China likely hit its peak workforce years ago and lacks sufficient millennials for consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:19">[04:54:19]</a>.
*   **Rising Labor Costs**: The cost of the workforce in China has increased by 14 to 15 times in the last 22 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:05">[05:06:05]</a>.
*   **Irreversible Decline**: This demographic collapse is not correctable, as there are not enough people under 40, even if macroeconomic structures encouraged larger families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:37">[05:37:37]</a>.

## Compounding Factors and Global Exposure

Beyond demographics, other factors are exacerbating China's decline:
*   **Industrial Competitiveness**: China is experiencing an increasing rate of decline in its industrial competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:30">[05:51:30]</a>.
*   **Energy and Food Insecurity**: China is becoming more exposed to energy and food insecurity due to Europe's absorption of Russian supplies, forcing China to rely on tenuous, exposed supply lines from the West via Suez or around Africa and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:08">[06:04:08]</a>.
*   **US Policy Shift**: The Biden Administration is considered the most protectionist US administration in a century, even more so than Donald Trump, further impacting China's trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:07">[06:42:07]</a>. This aligns with a broader trend of [[impact_of_us_policy_shift_on_china | US policy shift on China]].
*   **Leadership Paralysis**: Chairman Xi has so thoroughly purged the system that it's uncertain if he can become aware of issues in time or formulate coherent policies to address them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:30">[06:53:30]</a>.

## Implications for Global Supply Chains and US Industrial Growth

[[potential_collapse_of_chinese_economy_and_governance | China's final decade]] as a coherent economic power is potentially being accelerated by these political failures and exposures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:01">[07:11:01]</a>.

The biggest risk is whether the world has enough time to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:31">[07:44:31]</a>.
*   **US Industrial Expansion**: Construction spending for industrial projects in the United States has reached levels not seen since World War II, indicating a massive industrial expansion and reshoring trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:09">[07:50:09]</a>. This effort, while robust, ideally should have started five years earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:05">[08:01:05]</a>. This is part of [[deglobalization_and_its_impact_on_american_industry | deglobalization and its impact on American industry]] and [[shifts_in_global_supply_chains_and_their_consequences | shifts in global supply chains and their consequences]].
*   **Risk of Product Shortages**: The complete information vacuum and collapsed decision-making capacity in China, combined with the steep pace of decline, mean that critical industrial products still made in China might simply stop arriving without warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:03">[08:09:03]</a>.
    *   Products like transmission towers, transformers, and other industrial equipment necessary for building out the US industrial plant are still dependent on Chinese production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:05">[08:35:05]</a>.
    *   Some of these items already have waitlists exceeding 36 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:04">[08:50:04]</a>.
    *   The US might not realize these shipments are never coming until they simply fail to arrive, putting the country in a difficult position if its own industrial plant hasn't been built out fast enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:04">[08:56:04]</a>.
*   **Consequences of Shortages**: [[chinas_economic_decline_and_consumer_spending | China's economic decline and consumer spending]] is likely to cause significant follow-on damage in the US due to shortages, underscoring the urgent need to expand domestic manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:03">[09:21:03]</a>.

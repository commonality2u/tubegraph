The [[banking_issues_in_the_united_states_in_2023 | United States faced a banking hiccup]] in March 2023, with three banks (Silvergate, Signature, and Silicon Valley) either closing or collapsing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. While not considered a systemic risk like the 2007 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, the [[impact_of_tech_industry_on_recent_banking_failures | collapse of these tech-related banks]] prompted a response from the [[Biden Administrations plan for Gaza | Biden Administration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

## Background on Deposit Insurance
The United States has the [[role_of_fdic_in_banking_stability | Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)]], where banks pay a monthly fee to insure depositors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Deposits under $250,000 are federally guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. In such cases, the federal government does not need to intervene as the [[role_of_fdic_in_banking_stability | FDIC]] handles it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## Biden Administration's Decision
Many small startup companies, particularly those affected by the recent bank failures, had deposits exceeding the $250,000 insured limit, especially at Silicon Valley Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. In response, the [[Biden Administrations plan for Gaza | Biden Administration]] stepped in to declare that all depositors would be made whole by the [[role_of_fdic_in_banking_stability | FDIC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. This means that all banks will pay a slightly higher fee into the [[role_of_fdic_in_banking_stability | FDIC]] system to cover the costs, ensuring taxpayers do not directly fund the bailout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

## Rationale for the Decision
This measure was considered the "right tool for the job" as it effectively put a hard stop to any risk of a wider bank run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. It provided a backstop for the "itty-bitty crisis" that was unfolding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

## Introduction of Moral Hazard
However, critics argue that by backing all depositors, the [[Biden Administrations plan for Gaza | Biden Administration]] introduced "moral hazard" into the financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

> [!definition] Moral Hazard
> Moral hazard refers to a situation where one party takes on more risk because another party has agreed to bear the cost of that risk. In this context, it suggests that companies might continue to engage in risky financial behavior, knowing that the government will step in to cover uninsured deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## Perceived Consequences
The decision to cover all deposits, regardless of the insurance limit, is seen by some as encouraging companies to continue "doing stupid things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This means that all bank customers may face consequences such as lower bank interest rates or more difficult loan conditions, to cover the costs for a few startup companies whose CFOs allegedly overlooked the limits of the deposit insurance system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This approach is believed to have "injected a permanent level of stupidity into the financial system" that was unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

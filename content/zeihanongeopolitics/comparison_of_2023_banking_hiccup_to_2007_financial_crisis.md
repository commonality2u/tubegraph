The United States experienced a "banking hiccup" in March 2023, with the closure or collapse of three notable banks: Silvergate, Signature, and Silicon Valley Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This event drew immediate comparisons to past financial downturns, particularly the [[comparisons_to_past_financial_crises | financial crisis of 2007]]. However, significant differences in scale, root causes, and systemic risk distinguish the 2023 events from the crisis of 2007.

## Scale and Scope

Unlike the [[comparisons_to_past_financial_crises | financial crisis of 2007]], when "all of our Big Ten Banks were in trouble all the same time," the 2023 situation involved smaller institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Silicon Valley Bank, the largest of the three, was ranked "number 16 in the country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This localized impact suggests that the current situation is "nothing like" the widespread issues seen in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Root Causes: Loans vs. Deposits

Financial crises typically stem from problems with loans as the cost of capital rises with the business cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

*   **2007 Financial Crisis**: The core issue in 2007 was [[australias_subprime_financial_crisis | subprime loans]] within the real estate market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This involved a significant volume of "questionable loans," estimated between $0.5 trillion and $2.5 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Many of these loans were provided to individuals, such as "Baristas who had no incomes," for "100 mortgages on million dollar homes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. When these loans went bad, it affected "almost every single Bank within the entire system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, creating "problems across the entire space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **2023 Banking Hiccup**: In contrast, "nothing like that is going on this time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The problem in 2023 is not primarily on the loan side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The affected banks largely catered to the [[impact_of_tech_industry_on_recent_banking_failures | tech industry]], particularly "newer firms and startup firms and research firms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. These companies often do not generate immediate income and rely on venture capitalists for capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. As venture capitalists have had less capital to invest, startups have drawn down their cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Thus, the issue for these banks has been a draw-down in deposits, not bad loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, meaning they "haven't had enough operating Capital to continue normal operations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This means the overall financial sector's exposure to these issues is minimal, as loans are not widely sold among banks in this specific context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Systemic Risk and Government Response

The current situation is seen as the financial system "taking out the trash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. While some banks were expected to fail, this does not signal a "broader contagion systemic risk sort of thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The stock market's discounting of financial assets is considered a "gross overreaction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

The United States has the [[Role of FDIC in banking stability | Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)]], which insures deposits up to $250,000 through fees paid by all banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. In 2023, for the affected banks like Silicon Valley Bank, many startups had deposits exceeding this insured limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. The [[Biden Administrations response to banking issues and moral hazard | Biden Administration stepped in to ensure that all depositors would be made whole by the FDIC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, with banks paying higher fees into the system rather than taxpayers bearing the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. This measure effectively puts "a hard stop in any risk of a bank run" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, though it has been criticized for potentially introducing [[Biden Administrations response to banking issues and moral hazard | moral hazard]] by encouraging companies to continue risky deposit practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

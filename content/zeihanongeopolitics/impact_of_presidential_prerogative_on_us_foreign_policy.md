## Historical Context: The Bipartisan Consensus and Its Demise

Prior to approximately 2012, the United States maintained a [[political_dynamics_and_alliances_in_the_united_states_and_its_implications | bipartisan consensus]] in foreign and strategic policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This consensus was rooted in the idea that countering the Soviet Union and global communism was paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. To ensure national security and economic well-being, the US sought to build a global alliance network and promote free trade, fostering a [[impact_of_american_politics_on_globalization | globalized world]] where nations would benefit from participating in American security agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This approach led to the formation of alliances like NATO, and those with Japan, Korea, and Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

However, over a 16-year period starting around 2012, this [[political_dynamics_and_alliances_in_the_united_states_and_its_implications | bipartisan consensus]] "withered away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This decline was attributed to:
*   Barack Obama's "visceral disinterest in governing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   The rise of economically populist presidents like Donald Trump and Joe Biden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

The Republican Party, historically responsible for crafting much of US foreign policy, shifted its stance, with National Security and business conservatives no longer integral to the party's core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Some Republican factions have even found themselves aligned with countries like Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea on certain issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This indicates that US security policy is currently in a state of flux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The institutions of both major parties are in question, with leadership reportedly guiding them into a "nonfunctional era," making it difficult to have a meaningful conversation about foreign policy for several more years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## The Nature of Presidential Power in Foreign Policy

In the United States, most foreign policy falls under the **presidential prerogative** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Congress rarely plays a role in its formative stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. This means that the president largely determines the direction and priorities of US foreign policy.

## Current Landscape: Lack of Consistency and Experience

Given the current political climate, predicting the consistency of future US foreign policy is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. The potential future leaders, Kamala Harris and JD Vance (as a likely successor to a potentially incapacitated Donald Trump), present unique challenges:

*   **Kamala Harris:** Described as having "very limited experience," with her primary background being a prosecutor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. She has not implemented policy and would likely enter the White House without a fully competent, personally loyal circle of advisors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Her foreign policy stance is largely an "unknown" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

*   **JD Vance:** Considered even less experienced than Harris, and described as a "chameleon" willing to say anything to gain power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

Both potential candidates are characterized by:
*   Economically populist tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   Lack of significant "real world" or government experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   Weak or non-existent institutional loyalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   Negligible policy experience to indicate future priorities or reactions to hypothetical scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

This lack of a clear track record and established institutional support means that future US foreign policy directions are highly uncertain and subject to change based on the president's individual judgment and evolving circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. This contributes to the broader [[shifts_in_us_foreign_policy_and_its_implications | shifts in US foreign policy and its implications]] and the [[impact_of_global_geopolitical_issues_on_us_foreign_policy_focus | impact of global geopolitical issues on US foreign policy focus]].

## Exceptions to Presidential Prerogative: The Case of NAFTA

The primary exceptions to this extensive presidential authority are issues where the president has chosen to cede authority to Congress, locking in policies through an act of Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. These policies require another act of Congress to be overturned and are therefore more likely to endure across administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

The most significant example of such a policy, and the most important foreign policy priority for the United States, is the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which was renegotiated by [[united_states_foreign_policy_management_under_trump | Donald Trump]] into the USMCA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The renegotiation of NAFTA was considered a "brilliant" move because it occurred at the right time with the right partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Mexico has become the United States' number one trade partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, and is seen as core to the US's economic future outside of a potentially dangerous relationship with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

Despite the political changes, the established NAFTA agreement is expected to remain stable due to the congressional involvement in its renegotiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Neither Kamala Harris nor JD Vance are anticipated to have the political authority or interest to overturn it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. This highlights how congressional acts can limit the scope of presidential prerogative in specific areas of foreign policy.

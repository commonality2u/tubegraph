The United States has undergone a significant transformation in its energy posture, moving from a role as a guarantor of global energy flows to one of energy self-sufficiency and potential disruptor in international markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This shift has profound [[geopolitical_implications_for_the_united_states_and_other_major_consumers | geopolitical implications]] for its foreign policy, alliances, and the global energy landscape.

## Historical Context: Global Oil Guarantee

For decades, during globalization and the Cold War, the United States maintained a strategic interest in the Persian Gulf's oil supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This was not primarily to fuel the US itself, as it largely sourced oil from North America, Venezuela, and Africa, with the Middle East never accounting for more than 20% of its crude imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Instead, the US needed Persian Gulf oil to supply its allies, including Japan, China, Korea, Taiwan, France, Germany, Italy, and Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This was part of a deal to induce these nations to join the global order against the Soviet Union, ensuring they had fuel without needing to develop their own navies to secure oil routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## The Shale Revolution and US Energy Independence

The advent of the shale revolution drastically altered the US's energy needs and global role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. US crude imports from the Middle East essentially dropped to zero, with Saudi supertankers no longer needed off the coast of Louisiana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Imports from Africa also ceased, and Venezuela's output declined significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Consequently, the United States, alongside Canada, is now largely self-sufficient in energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This means that reliable global energy supplies are no longer perceived as a strategic necessity for the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## [[shifts_in_us_foreign_policy_and_its_implications | Shifts in US Foreign Policy]] and [[shift_in_us_global_strategic_role | Strategic Priorities]]

This energy independence has led to a notable [[us_disengagement_from_global_energy_market_issues | US disengagement from global energy market issues]] and a [[shift_in_us_global_strategic_role | shift in US strategic priorities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The US has reduced its naval presence in the Persian Gulf, with aircraft carriers rarely deployed there unless an immediate crisis emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The focus of US foreign policy has shifted towards domestic concerns and, to a lesser extent, East Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This is evident in the US's indifferent reaction to Kuwait's discovery of a new offshore oil field, as the security guarantee for such developments is no longer in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Implications for the Middle East and Saudi Arabia

The relationship between the United States and countries in the Persian Gulf, particularly Saudi Arabia, is undergoing a fundamental change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Historically, the US "bent over backwards" to maintain good relations with Saudi Arabia due to its massive crude reserves, which influenced other regional producers like Kuwait, the UAE, and Qatar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

In a post-globalized world, the US, being energy self-sufficient and even an exporter to select allies, no longer views ensuring unimpeded oil flow from the Persian Gulf as a primary strategic necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This changes the US from a guarantor of security to a potential disruptor in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

If the US alliance structure loses its perceived value, the relationship with Saudi Arabia could "absolutely tank" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Options for the US could include:
*   Denying staff needed to operate Saudi oil fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   Embargoing or destroying offshore loading facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   Seizing tankers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

The US perspective now views the region's oil as less vital, reducing its tolerance for perceived domestic violence or instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Transitional Phase

Despite the long-term trend, the US currently still perceives value in its alliance structure, particularly for objectives like the Ukraine War and containing China's semiconductor ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This means there's still a perceived value in crude continuing to flow unimpeded out of the Persian Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. However, the US is preparing for a "middle ground," where it might force the region to be more selective about where it sells its crude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

In a hypothetical conflict with China, one of the US's initial actions could be to block the Strait of Hormuz, thereby cutting off crude supply to China within three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

### Saudi Search for New Security Guarantors

As the US disengages, Saudi Arabia will need to find a new security guarantor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Potential candidates with a blue water navy or the ability to project power over long distances are limited:
*   **China:** Lacks the range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **Japan:** Has a navy but is not yet ready to deploy a large army due to its pacifist stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. A [[potential_geopolitical_shifts | co-dominion]] between the US and Japan over the Pacific, including energy security for Japan, is more likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Britain and France:** The UAE has already established military cooperation with France, but Saudi Arabia is reluctant to partner with European powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
*   **Turkey:** Could potentially march through Iraq to Riyadh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. However, this poses a risk to Saudi Arabia by inviting a superior military power with direct access to its resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

The challenge for Saudi Arabia is finding a protector who would defend them without seeking to control their oil reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

The BRICS summit, held in South Africa, was initially considered unlikely to achieve significant outcomes, potentially being a "stupid Summit" that would amount to nothing [00:00:38]. However, it offers insight into the architecture of the international system [00:00:44].

## Origins and Structure of BRICS

The BRICS grouping (Brazil, Russia, India, China) was not formed by its member states' initiative. Instead, it originated from a finance professional's observation that Baby Boomer capital needed bond markets, and these four countries presented large opportunities [00:00:59]. South Africa was later included [00:01:11]. From its inception, the group has failed to forge any meaningful deals [00:01:17]. While a Development Bank was established, over 90% of its capital comes from China [00:01:20].

A key challenge for BRICS is the lack of significant intra-group trade. Apart from exports to China, Brazil conducts little trade with the other members [00:01:32]. The same applies to South Africa and [[strategic_and_diplomatic_implications_for_russia | Russia]] [00:01:35]. [[great_power_politics_involving_india_and_western_relations | India]] is an exception, notably disliking [[relation_between_brics_countries_and_their_global_strategic_goals | China]] [00:01:39].

### [[role_of_the_brics_in_global_currency_discussions | Global Currency Discussions]]

Periodically, discussions arise about forming a global or alternate currency to challenge the U.S. dollar. However, these talks consistently fall apart when details are addressed [00:01:46]. Currently, [[great_power_politics_involving_india_and_western_relations | India]], [[relation_between_brics_countries_and_their_global_strategic_goals | China]], South Africa, and the BRICS-owned bank have all publicly stated they are not interested in a global currency [00:01:54]. The only two countries still advocating for it are [[strategic_and_diplomatic_implications_for_russia | Russia]], which believes everyone should use the ruble, and [[brazils_economic_and_infrastructure_issues | Brazil]], whose foreign policy on economic matters is described as "La Dee Da" or lacking substance [00:02:01].

## Member Agendas at the Summit

The summit's aim was to gather dozens of leaders to find common ground, but historical precedent suggests this would be difficult [00:02:27]. Each BRICS member arrived with their own set of grievances and desires:
*   **[[strategic_and_diplomatic_implications_for_russia | Russia]]** wanted other nations to boycott the West until its demands regarding Ukraine were met, while reserving the right for itself to trade with anyone [00:02:35].
*   **[[relation_between_brics_countries_and_their_global_strategic_goals | China]]** hoped to garner enough support from other countries to demand trade concessions from Washington [00:02:51].
*   **[[great_power_politics_involving_india_and_western_relations | India]]** historically acted as a non-aligned power, but as [[relation_between_brics_countries_and_their_global_strategic_goals | China]] becomes more assertive, [[great_power_politics_involving_india_and_western_relations | India]] is increasingly aligning with the American bloc [00:03:02].
*   **South Africa**, as the host, claimed neutrality [00:03:19].
*   **[[brazils_economic_and_infrastructure_issues | Brazil]]** maintained its "la di da" approach [00:03:24].

## Historical Parallels: The Non-Aligned Movement

Many of the countries attending the BRICS summit have roots in the Cold War-era Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), which sought a "third way" between East and West [00:03:40]. NAM members pursued a "New International Economic Order," aiming for Western nations to restructure trade practices to benefit former colonies [00:03:58]. While this eventually led to preferential trade access for Africa, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) nations with European markets, it did not achieve the desired systemic restructuring [00:04:09].

The current BRICS context is less optimistic than NAM, primarily because the interests of the participating groups are far more diverse than those in the early post-colonial era [00:04:25].

## [[expansion_of_brics_and_potential_implications | Expansion of BRICS]]

The BRICS summit ultimately decided to [[expansion_of_brics_and_potential_implications | expand its membership]] by adding six new countries: Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Ethiopia, and Argentina [00:05:07]. This expansion, however, is seen as an indication that BRICS has no plans of accomplishing anything useful in the future [00:05:13].

### Implications of New Members

The addition of Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Iran has led some to claim that the expanded BRICS now produces 50-60% of global oil, signaling the "downfall of the dollar" and the end of the petrodollar system [00:05:34]. However, this assessment is considered exaggerated [00:05:56]. While Saudi Arabia and [[strategic_and_diplomatic_implications_for_russia | Russia]] conduct some oil sales in Yuan or Rupees to bypass sanctions [00:06:01], their motivation for exploring non-dollar transactions stems from seeking security guarantees, not currency preference [00:06:23]. Saudi Arabia's use of the U.S. dollar has always been tied to a bilateral security relationship with the U.S., based on the expectation that the U.S. would protect them [00:07:02]. As the U.S. seems less interested in this role, the Saudis are looking for alternatives, but [[relation_between_brics_countries_and_their_global_strategic_goals | China]] lacks the capacity to deploy forces in a way that would satisfy Saudi security concerns, especially given [[internal_conflicts_and_diverse_interests_within_brics | Iran]] is their primary rival [00:07:47].

The inclusion of [[internal_conflicts_and_diverse_interests_within_brics | Iran]], Saudi Arabia, and UAE simultaneously highlights a significant issue: it guarantees that on most important matters, members within the organization will hold "diametrically opposed positions forever" [00:08:41]. For instance, BRICS cannot have a meaningful energy policy due to the conflicting interests of [[strategic_and_diplomatic_implications_for_russia | Russia]], [[internal_conflicts_and_diverse_interests_within_brics | Iran]], Saudi Arabia, and UAE [00:08:48].

### Argentina, Ethiopia, and Egypt

*   **Ethiopia** brings little to the table. It is one of the ten poorest countries globally per capita, landlocked, and notably not part of [[relation_between_brics_countries_and_their_global_strategic_goals | China]]'s Belt and Road Initiative due to a lack of investment viability [00:09:02]. Its inclusion seems primarily for "African Flair" [00:09:17].
*   **Argentina** is not poor but has an "entitlement complex," expecting financial aid without repayment [00:09:27]. Its application for BRICS membership is driven by the hope of securing [[relation_between_brics_countries_and_their_global_strategic_goals | Chinese]] money, as it consistently seeks new financial access points to avoid debt repayment [00:09:31]. These two countries are seen as a "drain on the organization" [00:09:51].
*   **Egypt** is largely a U.S. satellite state, with the U.S. providing aid to maintain peace with Israel and Jordan [00:09:57]. Its inclusion is likely due to [[great_power_politics_involving_india_and_western_relations | India]]'s lingering affinity for the Non-Aligned Movement, where Egypt was a politically potent player [00:10:14]. Economically and strategically, Egypt offers little to the group [00:10:22].

## Outlook for BRICS

When an organization expands, it either features an overwhelmingly powerful member dictating terms (like the U.S. in NATO) or it becomes paralyzed by diverse viewpoints [00:10:30]. BRICS is firmly in the latter category [00:10:50]. Significant progress in the midterm is only possible if:
1.  **[[relation_between_brics_countries_and_their_global_strategic_goals | China]] pays for everything**, subsidizing countries like Argentina and Ethiopia [00:10:58]. However, this is unlikely, as major powers like the Soviet Union attempting similar strategies in the 1970s "broke the bank" [00:11:11]. [[relation_between_brics_countries_and_their_global_strategic_goals | China]] is unlikely to pay for influence in places it cannot control [00:11:18].
2.  **BRICS rapidly expands into a new Non-Aligned Movement** [00:11:29]. However, this is improbable given [[relation_between_brics_countries_and_their_global_strategic_goals | China]]'s clear alignment goals and [[strategic_and_diplomatic_implications_for_russia | Russia]]'s distinct objectives [00:11:36]. While many countries in the Global South have not condemned [[strategic_and_diplomatic_implications_for_russia | Russia]]'s actions in Ukraine, they are unwilling to follow its lead [00:11:48]. Furthermore, [[relation_between_brics_countries_and_their_global_strategic_goals | China]]'s "nationalist, almost hateful, domineering goals" for its rise make other nations wary of becoming pawns [00:11:55].

Ultimately, the BRICS summit's true significance was minimal. [[relation_between_brics_countries_and_their_global_strategic_goals | Chinese]] President Xi Jinping's absence from expected opening ceremonies suggests that [[relation_between_brics_countries_and_their_global_strategic_goals | China]] views BRICS primarily as a rhetorical vehicle, not a truly useful platform [00:12:23].

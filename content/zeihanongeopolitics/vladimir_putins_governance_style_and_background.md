The [[russias_organized_crime_and_government_connections | Russian government]] under [[vladimir_putins_involvement_and_potential_motive | Vladimir Putin]] is characterized by a clique of individuals predominantly from Saint Petersburg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. [[vladimir_putins_involvement_and_potential_motive | Putin]] himself served as vice mayor there for much of the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, following his tenure as a KGB officer in East Germany, where his role involved acquiring goods through illicit means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Origins and Early Influences

[[vladimir_putins_involvement_and_potential_motive | Putin]]'s early perspective was that the [[russias_organized_crime_and_government_connections | Russian system]] was incapable of self-sufficiency in producing valuable items, thus necessitating their acquisition through other means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This mindset was evident in Saint Petersburg, where he collaborated with local [[russias_organized_crime_and_government_connections | organized crime]] to govern the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Upon becoming the national leader, [[vladimir_putins_involvement_and_potential_motive | Putin]] brought his associates with him, perpetuating this operational model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. While [[vladimir_putins_involvement_and_potential_motive | Putin]] is considered relatively clean by [[russias_organized_crime_and_government_connections | Russian leadership]] standards, the individuals around him who perform the "dirty work" have consistently been involved in corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## The Nature of [[vladimir_putins_involvement_and_potential_motive | Putin]]'s Government

The underlying structure of the [[russias_organized_crime_and_government_connections | Russian state]] is not merely corrupt but employs a distinct selection process for its top officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The unofficial duty of these officials is to extract wealth from the populace and the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This means the system prioritizes individuals skilled in intimidation over effective managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Consequently, [[russias_organized_crime_and_government_connections | organized crime]] operates in conjunction with the [[russias_organized_crime_and_government_connections | Russian government]] at the national level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The governance tools employed by the [[vladimir_putins_involvement_and_potential_motive | Putin]] administration are those typically used to manage an [[russias_organized_crime_and_government_connections | organized crime]] syndicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This shared operational philosophy has enabled [[vladimir_putins_involvement_and_potential_motive | Putin]] to forge agreements with Chechen leaders, as they operate with a similar "Warlord-robber" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Impact on Competence and Leadership

This governing philosophy has resulted in the exclusion of most strategic thinkers who were once integral to the Soviet system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This deficit in strategic thinking is particularly evident in [[implications_of_the_coup_attempt_on_putins_leadership_and_russian_military_strategy | military tactics]] and professionalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Although [[vladimir_putins_involvement_and_potential_motive | Putin]] was inclined towards Western models due to Saint Petersburg's historical role as a "window on the west," he never cultivated the necessary skill sets to advance beyond ideological considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. As a result, [[russias_organized_crime_and_government_connections | Russian institutions]] exhibit less competence compared to the Soviet era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. [[vladimir_putins_involvement_and_potential_motive | Putin]] has failed to assemble a team capable of steering the country in a different direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, with competent individuals like former Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov gradually becoming disassociated from his government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

This environment contributed to the rise of figures like [[prigozhins_previous_activities_and_influence_in_global_affairs | Prigozhin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Despite lacking competence (described as a "former caterer"), [[prigozhins_previous_activities_and_influence_in_global_affairs | Prigozhin]]'s embrace of the "hard man" image aligned with the prevailing ethos within the top [[implications_of_the_coup_attempt_on_putins_leadership_and_russian_military_strategy | leadership]], allowing him to achieve prominence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The recent [[implications_of_the_coup_attempt_on_putins_leadership_and_russian_military_strategy | Russian coup]] attempt further highlights weaknesses in [[putins_strategic_errors_and_political_stability | Putin's grip on the system]] and his command over [[implications_of_the_coup_attempt_on_putins_leadership_and_russian_military_strategy | military operations]] and law enforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This public challenge, even if not intended to succeed, has exposed the "hollow" nature of the state and the perceived incompetence of [[implications_of_the_coup_attempt_on_putins_leadership_and_russian_military_strategy | Putin's leadership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

Canada has faced significant [[demographic_challenges_in_developed_countries | demographic challenges]], particularly related to its aging population. Approximately 25 years ago, Canada was identified as one of the world's most rapidly aging societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

### The Immigration Strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>

To counter the demographic trend of aging into "oblivion" — a path seen in countries like [[Demographic Challenges Facing China | China]] or [[Demographic challenges facing Russia | Russia]] — both the Conservative government under Stephen Harper and the subsequent Liberal government under Justin Trudeau gradually increased immigration levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. This strategy aimed to bring in a large number of people under age 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### Initial Successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>

The [[canadas_immigration_strategy_and_demographics | immigration policy]] has shown some success:
*   It has "fended off the labor problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   It has "rounded out the bottom of the population structure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   These measures have effectively bought Canada an additional 20 to 40 years without needing a significant policy change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

### Emergent Challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>

Despite its successes, the rapid increase in population through immigration has generated new and significant challenges:
*   **Population Growth:** Canada's population has increased by 10% to 15% in just 15 years due to this policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **[[housing_market_and_social_tension_in_canada | Housing Market Stress]]:** The influx of new residents, often arriving with some capital and skill sets, can afford to purchase homes. This demand has driven up housing prices significantly, impacting the cost of living for all Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Inflation:** The "partial solution" of increased immigration has directly contributed to an inflation problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   **Policy Dilemma:** There is "no clear path" or "easy fix" for these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. The Trudeau government has attempted to dial back immigration, for example, by reducing university sponsorships, which has already severely contracted the number of new arrivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. However, this risks generating a new labor shortage and further inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

The ability to manage [[canadas_immigration_strategy_and_demographics | immigration]] and the associated labor force issues is currently the dominant political issue in Canada, even overshadowing concerns about relations with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. While these are significant problems, from an international Western perspective, they are considered "great problems" because Canada has successfully bought time to wrestle with these "second-order effects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

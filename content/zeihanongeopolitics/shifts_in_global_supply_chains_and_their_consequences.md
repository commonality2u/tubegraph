The global economic landscape is undergoing significant changes, marked by widespread recessions and a fundamental [[global_economic_restructuring_and_its_impacts | restructuring]] of supply chains, driven largely by [[global_demographic_shifts_and_future_economic_implications | global demographic shifts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Widespread Economic Slowdown

Several major economies are currently experiencing recession or significant slowdowns:
*   The United Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>
*   Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>
*   Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>
*   China, which is either in recession or very close, based on available data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   Israel, the Netherlands, most of Scandinavia, and Western Europe are all experiencing slow growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   Even economies still showing growth, such as [[indias_manufacturing_sector_and_global_shift | India]], are doing so at a very slow pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   Australia and New Zealand are also likely approaching recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

In contrast, North America is currently performing well economically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Demographic Drivers of Global Shifts

Two primary demographic factors are contributing to this global economic shift:

### China's Population Collapse and its Economic Impact
The anticipated post-COVID economic bounce in China did not materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Emerging demographic data suggests China has experienced a significant and ongoing population collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   The American birth rate has been higher than China's since the mid-1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   China is now facing a shortage of working-age adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   New data indicates a large shortage of children starting kindergarten, suggesting a sharp decline in births starting five years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   This means China is running out of people under the age of 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   As a result, the possibility of China experiencing any significant consumption-driven economic activity is effectively zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

This demographic challenge presents a major problem for countries that export raw materials to China, such as Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. For European and Japanese economies, exporting to China has been a significant business, and its decline presents a different, yet connected, challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Aging Populations in Advanced Economies
Many advanced economies are further along in their demographic decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   On average, half of the world's Baby Boomers have already retired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   Countries like Italy, Germany, Korea, and Spain are significantly affected by this trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   Consumption typically drops off relative to income after age 45 and plummets upon retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   Large portions of the advanced world have now reached a point where consumption-led growth is no longer a possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Consequences for Global Economic Growth and Trade

With China's declining consumption potential and advanced economies aging out, the possibility of export-led growth is also limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. If the American market also becomes less accessible, there will be no remaining engines for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

> [!warning] End of Global Economic Growth
> It is likely that the world has already passed through its last major period of global economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. With Europe, Northeast Asia, and China facing demographic and economic challenges, the only remaining growth engine appears to be North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## North America's Unique Position

The United States is experiencing significant growth due to several factors:
*   **Millennial Consumption**: Millennials still have many years of consumption-heavy behavior ahead of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Government Investment**: The current administration's government investments are generating growth in the short to mid-term, despite potential debt issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Industrial Construction Spending**: There has been an explosion in industrial construction spending in the US as companies recognize the need to build products domestically if they want them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This trend is expected to continue for at least another decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This trend contributes to the [[effects_of_covid_on_us_supply_chains_and_manufacturing | re-shoring]] of manufacturing and changes in [[impact_of_chinese_collapse_on_global_supply_chains_and_us_industrial_growth | global supply chains]].

## [[Future of global trade and regionalization trends | Future Outlook]]

The world is entering a period of sharp bifurcation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. North America is poised for continued domestic growth, while other regions struggle with a lack of consumption-led growth and a diminishing ability to rely on export-led growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

This environment could lead to:
*   Breakdown of unreplaced supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   Economic depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   Inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   Simultaneous industrial and consumption growth in some regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

These consequences are anticipated to manifest significantly within the current decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

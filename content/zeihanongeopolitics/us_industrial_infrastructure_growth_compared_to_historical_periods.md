The United States is currently undergoing its most significant [[reindustrialization_process_in_the_united_states | re-industrialization process]] in history, rapidly expanding its industrial infrastructure, factories, refineries, pipelines, and roads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This build-out is occurring at a pace even faster than during World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Legacy Factors Influencing Industrial Capacity

Several long-standing factors have contributed to the United States' industrial potential:

### Highly Skilled Labor Force
The U.S. possesses the most highly skilled labor force globally by a significant margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. While countries like Singapore might have higher overall education levels for their smaller populations, and Germany or France might show slightly higher productivity per hour, the sheer size of the U.S. labor force (four to six times larger) means there is little the nation cannot achieve if it commits to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Historically, since 1945 and particularly since 1991, the U.S. has concentrated on extremely high-value-added production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Basic manufacturing, such as underwear production, was largely shifted overseas to countries like Mexico, China, and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Instead, the U.S. focused on designing complex products like computers, space stations, and microchips, as the manufacturing of these items was not considered sufficiently high-value-added for the American workforce's skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### The Shale Revolution
The Shale Revolution has made the United States abundant in natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Natural gas serves not only as a power fuel but also as a crucial input for chemical components used in various manufacturing sectors, from electrical work to diapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The U.S. became net independent in natural gas approximately ten years ago, and in oil shortly thereafter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

The Shale Revolution initially spurred significant growth in the chemicals sector, leading the U.S. to become the world's largest producer of precursor materials for petrochemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. These materials are now being utilized for the next stages of heavy manufacturing, with a substantial portion of industrial spending dedicated to building the foundational components required for further industrial expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Current Drivers of Industrial Growth

Two major recent developments have significantly accelerated industrial growth:

### COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in international supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. China's central role in global manufacturing and its COVID-19 lockdowns highlighted the need for domestic production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. During the pandemic, total industrial construction spending in the U.S. doubled, exceeding the 50-year average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### The [[role_of_the_inflation_reduction_act_in_reshoring_and_industrial_buildout | Inflation Reduction Act]] (IRA) and NAFTA 2.0
In the last two years, the passage of the [[role_of_the_inflation_reduction_act_in_reshoring_and_industrial_buildout | Inflation Reduction Act]] (IRA) by the Biden Administration has further boosted industrial spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. The IRA, which is not solely focused on inflation, allocates roughly a trillion dollars to rebuild the power system and reshore production across various sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This includes provisions similar to those in NAFTA and NAFTA 2.0, collectively driving the doubling of construction spending yet again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This means that industrial construction spending, already at record levels three years ago, has now doubled those previous records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## Outlook

While this intense industrial build-out may lead to some short-to-midterm inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, the long-term benefits are substantial. In a few years, the U.S. is expected to have a localized supply chain system that employs local workers, serves local customers, uses less energy and water, involves fewer steps, and is largely resilient to international disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

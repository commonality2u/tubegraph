Gazprom, Russia's state natural gas monopoly, announced its full-year output levels are the lowest they have been since 1978, predating the Soviet collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This significant decline is primarily due to European efforts to reduce their dependence on [[european_sanctions_on_russian_natural_gas | Russian natural gas]] to zero, particularly for piped gas, which has been largely successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This [[impact_of_european_sanctions_on_gazproms_output | impact of European sanctions on Gazprom's output]] is considered one of the more effective aspects of the sanctions regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Unique Challenges of Natural Gas Transport

Natural gas requires specialized systems for production, transport, and export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Any disruption in this system—be it related to insurance, pipes, pumps, or legalities—can halt the entire operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Unlike oil, natural gas cannot be easily redirected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The majority of Russian gas destined for Europe originates from the Urngoy area, a field in production for half a century, and travels thousands of miles through pipelines via Ukraine and Belarus into various European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. When European nations stopped taking deliveries, Russia was compelled to gradually shut down these operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Other Russian Natural Gas Assets and Their Vulnerabilities

Russia possesses other natural gas options, including:
*   Gas from Eastern Siberia, east of the Urals, piped south to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   Liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities on Sakhalin Island (primarily exporting to Japan) and the Yamal Peninsula (primarily shipped to Europe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

While these facilities are still largely operational, they are expected to face challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The Yamal LNG, Sakhalin LNG, and the Kovykta field (near Lake Baikal) are technically challenging projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Crucially, the Russians did not develop these projects independently; foreign companies, notably British major BP, Japanese firms Mitsui and Mitsubishi, and ExxonMobil, were primarily responsible for their establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Most of these foreign companies have now withdrawn, leaving Russia without the necessary technical skills to maintain these projects long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Long-Term [[challenges_in_russian_natural_gas_industry | Challenges in Russian natural gas industry]]

The ability of Russia's natural gas sector to recover is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. While Russia was once a leader in ice and tundra production during the Soviet era, that expertise has diminished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. The Soviet industrial educational system collapsed around 1985, coinciding with a collapse in the Russian birth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Consequently, there are fewer people who could be trained in engineering, and the training system itself is defunct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. The youngest individuals with comprehensive petroleum engineering and reservoir management experience are now in their early 60s, and their numbers are dwindling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

For the past two decades, significant maintenance and recovery rate improvements in mature zones like Urngoy were largely performed by foreign companies such as BP, ExxonMobil, and to a lesser extent, German and Dutch firms, all of whom have now departed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

Rejuvenating a mature zone like Urngoy with shale technologies could be possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. However, shale development is labor-intensive and works best near population centers, not in remote, freezing environments like Urngoy, which also requires significant water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Given Urngoy's remote location—a thousand miles from any significant population center—it is unlikely to resume significant production, as Russia lacks the capacity and the required technologies are geographically inappropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Current European Exports and Future Disconnection

Russian natural gas exports to Europe have fallen by 85% compared to the start of the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. The remaining trickle primarily goes to three countries: the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. These nations have limited [[alternatives_to_russian_natural_gas_for_europe | alternatives to Russian natural gas for Europe]], which explains their general opposition to sanctions and why many exceptions involve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This situation is expected to persist through the current year but may change next year as European countries are actively building interconnections to permanently sever their reliance on Russian gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## Conclusion

When Europe completes its disconnection, the Russian natural gas industry will largely be reduced to serving its domestic market, with Sakhalin LNG potentially continuing due to Japanese involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. The prospect of the world's largest producer and exporter of natural gas vanishing from global markets in under four years is unprecedented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. The mild price shocks experienced by Europeans are attributed to their success in importing liquefied natural gas from other suppliers, primarily the Persian Gulf and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This shift has, however, created price pressure on other nations that previously sourced gas from these alternative suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. The European Union has implemented a sanctions regime that has effectively cut Russian exports and income without unduly shocking their own energy systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

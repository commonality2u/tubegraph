Peter Zeihan expresses confidence that de-globalization has passed the point of no return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This assertion is based on three primary factors: the shifting rationale behind American foreign policy, changes in American politics, and critically, [[global_demographic_shifts_and_future_economic_implications | global demographic shifts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## The Original Rationale for Globalization

For the United States, globalization was primarily a security strategy, not an economic one in the traditional sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. After World War II, facing the Soviet Union, the U.S. concluded it could not economically or politically support a conflict with an ocean separating them from allies in devastated countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The solution was to "bribe" other nations by using the U.S. Navy to patrol global oceans, ensuring access to materials and, crucially, the American market, which was the only one of significant size to survive the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. In exchange, allies had to let the Americans write their security policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This strategy succeeded, leading to the end of the Cold War as the Soviet system could not compete with the U.S.-led alliance of economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Shifting Global Economic Dynamics

In the decades since the Cold War, the world entered an era of "hyper-globalization," with many new players participating under U.S.-set rules, including Southeast Asia, Brazil, [[demographics_and_economic_growth_in_india | India]], Russia, and [[implications_of_chinas_demographic_data_for_the_economy | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The U.S. economy is no longer as large as all others combined; the rest of the world is now three or four times its size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This makes the indirect economic subsidization previously undertaken by the U.S. less tenable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Countries like [[demographic_and_economic_challenges_facing_china | China]] are now so dependent on globalization that their survival would require increased U.S. support, not decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Political Realignment and Globalization

American politics has undergone significant shifts since the Cold War's bipartisan foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Every few decades, politics shifts due to [[changing_demographics_and_their_political_impact | changing demographics]], economics, and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Key developments include:
*   The end of the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   The rise and fall of hyper-globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   The Baby Boomers moving from their prime into retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   The information revolution and social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

These shifts have fractured traditional political coalitions. Unions, which are largely anti-free trade, have largely fallen out of the Democratic coalition and are being courted by the Trump-led Republican coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. The business community and National Security conservatives, historically pro-globalization, have been sidelined from the Republican coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. As a result, no one in Washington wants to discuss globalization positively, as it risks alienating unions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

## The Core Demographic Argument: [[Impact of Demographics on Economic Future | The Impact of Demographics on the Economic Future]]

Perhaps the most significant reason for de-globalization is [[global_demographic_shifts_and_future_economic_implications | demographic changes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. When societies urbanize and industrialize, children shift from being free labor to expensive burdens, leading to fewer births <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. This transition began for rich countries 75 years ago and for the developing world 40 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

The world is "literally running out of people age 20 and under," a trend that began 20 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Consequently, most of the world is now running out of people age 40 and under <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The fundamental premise of trade and globalization requires consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. However, the traditional consuming demographic—people 45 and under, who buy homes and cars and have kids—no longer exists in the necessary numbers to sustain the global system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

Specific examples of aging societies include:
*   [[demographic_and_economic_challenges_facing_china | China]] and Russia, which are the two fastest-aging societies in human history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   [[european_demographic_trends_and_economic_impacts | Germany]] and South Korea are not far behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   Indonesia, [[demographics_and_economic_growth_in_india | India]], and Brazil are aging faster than most of the developing world has over the last 70 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   By 2040-2045, the average American is projected to be younger than the average Brazilian, and ten years later, younger than the average Indian, Indonesian, or Mexican <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

## Conclusion: The Irreversible Path to De-globalization

The combination of U.S. disinterest in maintaining globalization for security reasons, the political realignment in the U.S. that no longer favors it, and, most crucially, the [[demographic_challenges_in_developed_countries | global demographic shifts]] meaning there are not enough young people to consume, leads to the conclusion that de-globalization is irreversible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

Even if a future U.S. president were a strong globalist, they would need to unwind eight years of anti-globalization sentiment solidified into policy under the Biden administration, in addition to eight years of "strategic apathy" under the Obama administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This process would take more than four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. By the time the U.S. might theoretically re-engage with a globalized system in perhaps six years, [[demographic_and_economic_challenges_facing_china | China]] will likely have significantly declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

The United States is projected to cease its extensive patrolling of global oceans, a shift expected to significantly alter the existing economic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Historical Context of US Global Maritime Presence

Following World War II, the United States established a new global network primarily to counter the Soviet threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Recognizing its numerical disadvantage and Europe's devastation, the US sought to induce allies to position themselves between American forces and the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This inducement came in the form of global trade and [[deglobalization_and_its_impact_on_american_industry | globalization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

The US Navy was deployed to patrol global oceans, ensuring open trade routes for all nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Furthermore, the American market, which remained intact and was as large as the rest of the world combined after the war, was opened to exports from any country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This foundational structure led to the current global economic system, with a global GDP of roughly $90 to $100 trillion, a significant portion of which is based on international exchange that would be impossible without US maritime security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Even today, the US Navy is at least seven times more powerful than all other navies combined, excluding close allies like the British and Japanese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

The US implemented this system not primarily for its own benefit, as it possesses a largely continental economic system; extensive international trade integration only began with Mexico and Canada in 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The primary beneficiaries of this arrangement have been Germany, which faces demographic challenges, and [[impact_of_us_policy_shift_on_china | China]], which aspires to superpower status without a global navy or a consumption-led economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Current Shift in US Policy

For over a decade, the US has incrementally disengaged from maintaining this global trade system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This [[shift_in_us_global_strategic_role | policy shift]] is evident in a reduced willingness to protect assets like oil tankers or shipments from Russian territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. With allies facing demographic decline, the economic rationale for [[deglobalization_and_its_impact_on_american_industry | globalization]] is weakening, and the security rationale has largely disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Case Study: The Persian Gulf

The Persian Gulf is a key example of this [[the_impact_of_us_disengagement_from_the_middle_east | disengagement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Historically, the US obtained most of its energy from the Western Hemisphere and is now net independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Crude oil from the Persian Gulf primarily went to the US alliance network, but more recently, it has been directed to [[impact_of_us_policy_shift_on_china | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. This has weakened the strategic imperative for the US to maintain open sea lanes there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

Evidence of this shift includes the US Navy's inaction when Iran has confiscated or hijacked oil tankers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. While the US has recently deployed Marine Expeditionary Units (MEUs) to reassure Arab allies, an MEU's firepower is significantly less than the supercarriers that were routinely stationed in the Gulf just 10-15 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Potential Consequences for Global Trade

The most probable catalyst for a wider breakdown in global trade involves Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. As Russia intensifies its actions in Ukraine, including targeting agricultural systems and using confiscated grain, the US is likely to explicitly or implicitly withdraw protection from Russian maritime shipments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

Should something happen to one of these unprotected ships, such as piracy or seizure, global insurance rates are expected to dramatically increase as insurers realize the US Navy is no longer providing universal security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

This increased risk can disrupt fragile global supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>:
*   **Low Margins:** Most manufacturing, particularly for goods below the complexity of cell phones and computers, operates on profit margins less than three percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Geographic Span:** These supply chains often involve a dozen or more countries, especially across the Asian rim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Cascading Failure:** The interruption of even one step in such a low-margin, geographically dispersed product chain can lead to its complete collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Containerized Shipping:** The reliance on containerized shipping, where thousands of containers hold hundreds of thousands of components, makes the entire system vulnerable to minor disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

Such disruptions could cause the entire economic model of East Asia to break down rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Businesses with extended or "gangly" supply chains may need to prepare for potential closure, as there may not be sufficient time or available labor in regions like North America to restructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

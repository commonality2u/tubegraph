The [[us_electoral_system_and_its_effect_on_political_parties | US electoral system]], specifically its "first-past-the-post single member district system," encourages the formation of two large "big tent" political parties [00:00:39]. This system means that voters cast a ballot for one specific person representing a distinct geographic area, rather than for an entire party [00:00:26]. Consequently, parties must appeal broadly to gain a marginal vote advantage over their opposition [00:00:44]. Historically, third or fourth parties in the US rarely last for more than one or two political cycles before the system reverts to two dominant parties [00:00:52].

## Internal Factions and Shifting Dynamics
Within these "big tent" parties, there are numerous power centers and [[republican_and_democratic_party_factions | factions]] [00:01:10]. The political power of these [[republican_and_democratic_party_factions | factions]] fluctuates as technology, geopolitics, and social issues evolve [00:01:18]. The present era is identified as a period of significant transition due to factors like hyper-globalization followed by de-globalization, the rise of the information economy and social media, and the mass retirement of Baby Boomers [00:01:32]. Understanding the relationships between these [[republican_and_democratic_party_factions | factions]] within their respective parties is crucial [00:01:42].

## The Republican Coalition
Historically, the [[republican_and_democratic_party_factions | Republican Party]] has faced a numerical disadvantage, possessing fewer voters and [[republican_and_democratic_party_factions | factions]] than the Democrats [00:01:52]. Key [[republican_and_democratic_party_factions | Republican factions]] include pro-lifers, military voters, law and order voters, and business voters [00:02:01]. Despite their smaller numbers, this coalition has traditionally been very solid and reliable because the issues relevant to one [[republican_and_democratic_party_factions | faction]] typically do not clash with those of another [00:02:20]. For instance, pro-lifers generally do not concern themselves with business regulation, and the business community usually does not focus on military policy [00:02:18]. This cohesion leads to consistent voter turnout in each electoral cycle [00:02:26].

## The Democratic Coalition
In contrast, the [[republican_and_democratic_party_factions | Democratic Party]] has cast a very wide net, forming a broad coalition [00:02:38]. This coalition is broadly composed of minorities, coastal highly-educated elites, and organized labor [00:02:50]. The challenge for the Democratic coalition lies in finding common ground on specific policy issues during campaigns [00:03:04].

Examples of internal friction within the Democratic coalition include:
*   **Social Issues**: Coastal educated elites introducing terms like "Latin X" in an effort to combat racism, despite the term having no roots in Latin culture and being considered pointless or offensive by approximately 97% of Hispanics [00:03:22].
*   **Economic Policy**: The "Green Revolution," strongly supported by coastal educated individuals, is less favored by unions because many green jobs are not unionized [00:03:40].

When Democratic candidates focus on specific issues and practical pledges, such as Michael Dukakis or Hillary Clinton, it can ignite internal conflicts, leading to large segments of the Democratic electorate not showing up to vote [00:03:59]. To win, the Democratic Party often benefits from charismatic candidates who do not delve into specific policy details, as exemplified by Barack Obama's success [00:04:08].

## [[impact_of_donald_trump_on_the_republican_coalition | Impact of Donald Trump on the Republican Coalition]]
Under normal circumstances, the [[republican_and_democratic_party_factions | Republican Party]] benefits from its internal cohesion [00:04:25]. However, [[impact_of_donald_trump_on_the_republican_coalition | Donald Trump's]] influence has introduced numerous "wedge issues" across the [[republican_and_democratic_party_factions | Republican electorate]], disrupting this traditional solidarity [00:04:38].

Specific examples of this internal disruption include:
*   **Military and Abortion Policy**: Actions like Senator Tommy Tuberville's months-long prevention of military promotions over abortion policy created a conflict between military voters and abortion voters, [[republican_and_democratic_party_factions | factions]] that previously had no major points of contention [00:05:08].
*   **Business Community Alienation**: [[impact_of_donald_trump_on_the_republican_coalition | Donald Trump's]] dislike for dissent or conditional agreement has alienated the business community, driving them out of the traditional [[republican_and_democratic_party_factions | Republican coalition]] and separating them from social conservative voters [00:05:27].

This situation means the [[republican_and_democratic_party_factions | Republican Party]] is now facing a "Democratic-style cohesion test" [00:05:35]. Given that Republicans already have fewer voters than Democrats, a failure to maintain their coalition's unity, particularly if [[impact_of_donald_trump_on_the_republican_coalition | Donald Trump]] is the candidate, could numerically prevent them from winning the general election [00:05:54].

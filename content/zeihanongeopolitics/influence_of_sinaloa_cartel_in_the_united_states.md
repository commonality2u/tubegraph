The Sinaloa Cartel, which has been described as the largest organized crime group on the planet, extended its influence significantly into the [[United States]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Its operational methods allowed it to efficiently run drugs into the [[United States]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Operational Strategy in the US

Under the leadership of [[el_chapos_leadership_and_capture | El Chapo]], the Sinaloa Cartel was run as a business, not simply focused on power or money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This business-like approach involved strategies to run drugs to the [[United States]] with minimal friction and disruption to local law enforcement and populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The philosophy was to maintain good relations with local populations to prevent them from reporting the cartel to governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This strategy not only made it the largest drug-running group in Mexico but also the largest organized crime group in the [[United States]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## US Law Enforcement Response

The success of the Sinaloa Cartel, particularly under [[el_chapos_leadership_and_capture | El Chapo]], led the [[United States]] to declare him Public Enemy Number One <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Eventually, the [[United States]] was able to capture and extradite [[el_chapos_leadership_and_capture | El Chapo]], who is now serving multiple life sentences in the American prison system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

Another key figure, Ismael Zambada (also known as El Mayo), who took over many operations, was reportedly lured to Texas by one of [[el_chapos_leadership_and_capture | El Chapo]]'s sons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Upon landing in Texas, American law enforcement was waiting and arrested him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This suggests that the son potentially collaborated with authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## [[sinaloa_cartel_internal_conflict | Impact of Leadership Change on Cartel Operations]] in the US

The capture of [[el_chapos_leadership_and_capture | El Chapo]] and later El Mayo has left the organization in less competent hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The various factions within the cartel have started to go their own way, leading to a breakdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

This internal conflict is expected to expand beyond Sinaloa state and into the rest of Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Crucially, the same breakdown is anticipated north of the border, affecting [[mexicounited_states_relations_and_drug_cartels | MexicoUnited States relations and drug cartels]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Local distribution and retail operations of the cartel in the [[United States]], often run by local gangs, are expected to become independent and resist control from the remaining leadership factions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

This [[sinaloa_cartel_internal_conflict | Sinaloa Cartel internal conflict]] is projected to lead to:
*   Higher drug prices due to interruptions in the distribution system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   Increased violence as the organization breaks down at regional and local levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

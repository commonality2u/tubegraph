Recent advancements in [[us_military_strategy_and_current_status | US military strategy]] involve the deployment of new weapon systems, particularly in the [[naval_power_in_the_pacific_ocean | Pacific Ocean]], to counter shifting power balances with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. These developments address concerns about the [[comparison_of_us_and_chinese_naval_capabilities | comparison of US and Chinese naval capabilities]] and aim to enhance US projection capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Reassessing Naval Strength
While China appears to have more ships (between 370 and 620) compared to the United States (between 250 and 300), this numerical advantage doesn't fully represent capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The primary concern is not the number of ships, but rather the range of their weapon systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

Most Chinese vessels are small, typically only a couple of thousand tons, which the US generally doesn't field due to their vulnerability and limited range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Only about 10% of China's ships can travel more than 1,000 miles, and few have a strike capability beyond a couple of thousand miles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. In contrast, American supercarriers are fully Blue Water capable and can strike targets at considerable distances using their aircraft and standoff missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## New US Weapon System Deployments
By the end of the next calendar year, the United States will deploy two new types of weapon systems in the Pacific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Land-Based Intermediate-Range Missiles
The first new system is a land-based intermediate-range missile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This development follows the demise of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

#### Historical Context of the INF Treaty
The INF Treaty, established during the late Cold War, prohibited land-based missiles with a range between 500 km and 5,500 km <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Its purpose was to prevent a rapid nuclear strike in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The treaty collapsed because Russia began deploying its own weapon systems in violation of the agreement, and China, never a signatory, massively implemented such systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

#### Deployment and Capabilities
Despite the INF Treaty's abrogation in 2019, discussions on these new US weapon systems began within a year, with implementation set for 2024, demonstrating rapid development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The Pentagon has been reserved about the exact range, but these systems are initially deploying to US territories like Midway and Guam, with Australia also likely to host some in Darwin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. These missiles will allow the US to launch cruise missiles with ranges in the thousands of kilometers, capable of intersecting Chinese shipping routes and naval patrols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. They are primarily designed for land attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

### Maritime-Targeting Tomahawk Cruise Missiles
The second development is a version of the Tomahawk cruise missile, primarily for submarines, now capable of targeting maritime targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

#### Tomahawk Evolution
First debuted in the 1991 Gulf War, Tomahawks were among the first "smart weapons," able to follow GPS maps and target fixed locations from over 1,000 miles away with a half-ton warhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. A single hit from such a weapon can severely damage most vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

#### Targeting Moving Ships
The challenge has historically been remotely targeting moving ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. While Chinese ballistic missiles designed to target US naval assets can use satellite reconnaissance for initial placement, they lack active eyes on the missile, meaning they cannot adjust course if the target moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This contrasts with drone systems like the [[ukrainian_drone_missile_innovations | Shahed drones]] used by Russia in the [[impact_of_the_russia_ukraine_conflict_on_naval_strategy | Ukraine war]], which, though guided to specific points, are "dumb weapons" if the target moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

#### US Advantage in AI and Satellite Warfare
The US has a significant advantage in satellite warfare and AI capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Unlike China, which tightly controls AI development to prevent independent decision-making, the US fosters a more well-rounded approach to AI, including in weapon systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. This technology is crucial for the new Tomahawk's ability to target moving surface ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

In the event of a hot war, two or three American missile submarines, among the quietest and longest-range in the world, equipped with these new Tomahawks, could significantly neutralize China's ability to operate its longer-range naval vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

## Political Context for Development Delays
These weapon systems, including medium-range cruise missiles and the Tomahawk, are not entirely new technologies, with roots dating back to the late 1980s and early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. Their delayed deployment is attributed to political factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>:

*   **Clinton Administration (early post-Cold War)**: Focused on reconciliation, not developing weapons against potential friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **W. Bush Administration**: Occupied with conflicts in the Islamic world; Russia was a crucial partner for supplying troops in Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   **Obama Administration**: Despite growing Russian aggression and Chinese intellectual property theft, little action was taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. President Obama also unofficially viewed the military as an "enemy" and was reluctant to empower it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   **Trump Administration**: Updates to strategic doctrine and new weapon systems could not be managed effectively via executive orders or informal means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

This resulted in 12 years of "strategic incompetence" during a period when Russia and China were expanding their influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. It wasn't until the Biden administration that firm decisions were made on the development and deployment of these systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. President Biden's historical familiarity with these systems from the 1980s and the context surrounding the INF Treaty allowed for more robust and forward-looking security decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

India's energy position is characterized by its reliance on external sources and a unique strategic outlook on energy security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Current Energy Landscape

India's primary energy supply originates from the Persian Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Due to this, India is not expected to suffer from many of the global negatives, such as an energy crisis, that might sweep the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Furthermore, India's agricultural system is largely self-sufficient, including the fabrication of fertilizers, which contributes to its overall resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Future Energy Security and Strategic Actions

In a future scenario where energy becomes scarce, India is expected to take unilateral action to secure its needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. If a global energy crisis were to emerge, India would likely deploy its forces for its own reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

It is suggested that if one were to be concerned about actions in the Persian Gulf during such a crisis, the focus should be on India rather than traditional powers like the United States, China, Japan, Britain, or France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. India is identified as one of the very few countries capable of projecting force into the Persian Gulf if it chose to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Moreover, it is difficult to imagine any country, apart from potentially the United States, being able to inhibit India's actions in this regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

### Triggers for Intervention

The realization of such an intervention by India would depend on the occurrence of a significant energy crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. As of the time of discussion, neither the Ukraine war nor Chinese actions related to Taiwan have triggered such a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. However, it is considered likely to be "only a matter of time," particularly given that the United States no longer maintains a significant military presence in the Persian Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

This perspective highlights India's potential role as an independent actor in future [[great_power_politics_involving_india_and_western_relations | international politics]], especially concerning vital resources like energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

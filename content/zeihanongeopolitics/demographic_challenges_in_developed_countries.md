The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has presented its least optimistic economic forecast in 50 years, predicting 2.8% global growth for the next year and 3% for the next five years, which is likely over-optimistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This outlook is significantly influenced by demographic shifts, particularly in the developed world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Consumption-Driven Economies and Demographic Decline

In the developed world, most economic activity, such as private consumption (e.g., credit card use, buying homes, raising kids), is driven by people under age 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. However, mass urbanization, which began in most places around 1940-1950, has led to continuously lower birth rates across all rich countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Below Replacement Levels
Most of the advanced world dropped below the replacement population growth rate of 2.1 children per woman over 50 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. As a result, these countries are not only running out of children, which happened decades ago, but are now running out of working-aged adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The Baby Boomers, who were the last very large generation born in most developed countries, largely entered retirement in the last calendar year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Impact on Economic Growth
This demographic shift means that the rich world will, in most cases, never be able to generate the economic growth seen in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. When fewer children are born, and the population ages, spending patterns shift. For instance, 30-somethings without children spend money on themselves (e.g., cars, condos), whereas previous generations might have spent more on items like diapers, which spurred a different, more "octane" type of economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

The kind of growth experienced in [[demographic_and_economic_challenges_in_europe | Europe]] in the 1990s and 2000s is statistically impossible to return to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Therefore, secularly lower growth rates are expected to be the norm for the rich world for at least the next 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Financial Strain from Aging Populations
The capital traditionally available from the rich world to the developing world is no longer accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Even if it were, that money would increasingly be diverted to cover pensions and healthcare for a large and growing retired population within the developed nations themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Case Studies
The experience of countries like [[demographic_challenges_facing_germany | Germany]] and Japan highlights these challenges:
*   **Japan**: As Japan discovered in the 1990s and 2000s, building more infrastructure in an already well-developed country does not lead to significant additional economic growth beyond the construction phase itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Germany**: Countries like [[demographic_challenges_facing_germany | Germany]] are projected to face economic decline due to these demographic shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

The unwinding of the globalized world, from both a geographic and demographic perspective, is inherently leading to lower growth rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. While some countries might experience growth due to phenomena like "nearshoring" or "reshoring" manufacturing, this will be at the expense of global growth, leading to a "global starvation diet" from a growth perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

The United States is considering shifts in its Middle East policy, potentially leading to new alliances and partnerships in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. These changes are influenced by the ongoing conflict in Gaza and the Biden Administration's plans for humanitarian aid delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The US-Israel Relationship and Potential Breach

The Biden Administration's commitment to building a floating dock to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza has the potential to fundamentally alter the US-Israeli relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

*   **Gaza's Humanitarian Crisis**: Gaza is heavily dependent on aid, as it cannot sustain itself in terms of food or energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The Israeli counter-effort against Hamas has destroyed significant infrastructure and housing, leading to a severe humanitarian situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The proposed floating dock aims to provide at least 2 million meals a day, meeting roughly one-third of the territory's food demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Israeli Opposition**: The US plan for aid delivery, which would require a significant US military presence on the ground in Gaza for logistics and distribution, is not aligned with Israeli national security interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Even left-wing factions in Israel would oppose such a measure, as it cuts to the core of their survivability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Potential for Conflict**: Hamas remains active, and attacks on US forces are anticipated if a significant military footprint is established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This scenario could lead to a breach in the long-standing US-Israeli relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## Existing and Emerging Alliances for Israel

Despite tensions with the US, Israel has made progress in building diplomatic relationships within the [[geopolitical_tensions_in_the_middle_east | Middle East]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

*   **Abraham Accords and Beyond**: Israel has established diplomatic ties not only with Jordan and Egypt but also with Morocco and the UAE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. They are also close to normalizing relations with [[israels_potential_alliances_with_turkey_and_saudi_arabia | Saudi Arabia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

## US Disengagement and Regional Implications

A potential US disengagement from Israel could have significant consequences for the broader [[economic_and_military_relationships_in_the_middle_east | economic and military relationships in the Middle East]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

*   **Allies on Their Own**: If the United States were to reduce its ties with Israel, it would leave Israel's new partners, including Morocco, Tunisia, the UAE, and potentially [[potential_security_allies_for_saudi_arabia | Saudi Arabia]], to navigate regional dynamics without direct US support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Shift from Gulf States**: Such a move could also signal an end to US connections with the "slave states of the Persian Gulf," such as Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and [[potential_security_allies_for_saudi_arabia | Saudi Arabia]], which are criticized for their labor practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

## The Rise of Turkey as a US Partner

In the event of a significant shift away from Israel and the Gulf states, [[turkeys_potential_alliances_and_conflicts_in_europe_and_the_middle_east | Turkey]] emerges as the only viable alternative partner for the US in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

*   **Strategic Viability**: [[turkeys_potential_alliances_and_conflicts_in_europe_and_the_middle_east | Turkey]] possesses the most powerful military in the region, arguably more capable than all others combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. It is also considered more democratic and strategically viable than some traditional US allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Renewed Diplomatic Connections**: Diplomatic ties between the Biden Administration and the ErdoÄŸan administration in [[turkeys_potential_alliances_and_conflicts_in_europe_and_the_middle_east | Turkey]] have seen a resurgence in recent months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Meetings at the assistant defense secretary level have occurred to improve relations, which have been strained since the Iraq War in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. While the current Turkish government dislikes Israel, this does not preclude a US partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

These potential shifts represent a game-changing moment for US policy in the [[middle_east_geopolitics_and_oil_reliance | Middle East]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. The full extent of the Biden Administration's commitment to these changes will become clearer once the Gaza aid dock is operational or if significant shifts in US-Turkish relations are observed in the coming months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

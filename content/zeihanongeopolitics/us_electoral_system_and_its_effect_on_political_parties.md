The United States operates under a first-past-the-post, single-member district electoral system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This means voters choose one person to represent a specific geographic area, unlike systems where one votes for a party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This structure encourages the development of only two major "big tent" political parties, as they constantly need to secure marginal votes to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Consequently, third or fourth parties rarely endure for more than one or two political cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Party Factions and Evolution

Within these large, "big tent" parties, there are numerous power centers or [[Republican and Democratic Party Factions | factions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. These [[Republican and Democratic Party Factions | factions]] gain and lose political influence as technology, geopolitics, and social issues evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Recent decades have seen significant shifts, including hyper-globalization followed by de-globalization, the rise of the information economy and social media, and the mass retirement of Baby Boomers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:33]</a>. Understanding the relationships between these [[Republican and Democratic Party Factions | factions]] is crucial during such transitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Republican Party Coalition

The [[Republican and Democratic Party Factions | Republican Party]] traditionally faces a numerical disadvantage due to fewer voters and [[Republican and Democratic Party Factions | factions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Its [[Challenges in Building Political Party Coalition Consensus | coalition]] typically includes:
*   Pro-lifers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>
*   Military voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>
*   Law and order voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>
*   Business voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>

Despite smaller numbers, this [[Challenges in Building Political Party Coalition Consensus | coalition]] has historically performed well because the issues important to these groups often do not clash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. For instance, pro-lifers typically don't concern themselves with business regulation, and the business community isn't usually focused on military policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This results in a smaller but very solid and reliable [[Challenges in Building Political Party Coalition Consensus | coalition]], with high voter turnout, allowing them to succeed by attracting a few [[Independent voters in American elections | Independents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Democratic Party Coalition

The [[Republican and Democratic Party Factions | Democratic Party]] employs a very wide net, forming a three-part [[Challenges in Building Political Party Coalition Consensus | coalition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>:
*   Minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>
*   Coastal, highly-educated elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>
*   Organized labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>

The challenge for the Democratic [[Challenges in Building Political Party Coalition Consensus | coalition]] arises when discussing specific policies and issues, as it is difficult to find points of agreement among all three [[Republican and Democratic Party Factions | factions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:03:04]</a>. For example:
*   Efforts by coastal elites to introduce terms like "LatinX" to combat racism have been met with disinterest or offense by many Hispanics, creating a social issue split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   The Green Revolution, favored by coastal educated individuals, is less supported by unions because many associated jobs may not be unionized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:40]</a>.

When [[Democratic and Republican Nomination Processes | Democratic]] candidates like Michael Dukakis or Hillary Clinton run on specific issues or make practical pledges, it often incites internal conflict, leading to segments of the [[Democratic and Republican Nomination Processes | Democratic]] electorate not voting at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:04:00]</a>. To win, the [[Democratic and Republican Nomination Processes | Democratic Party]] often needs a charismatic candidate who avoids discussing real policy specifics, such as Barack Obama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:11]</a>.

## Impact of Donald Trump on Republican Cohesion

Under normal circumstances, Republicans benefit from fewer internal wedge issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:27]</a>. However, [[Potential Issues with Donald Trumps Influence in Future Elections | Donald Trump]] has disrupted this dynamic by introducing numerous wedge issues not only across society but within the Republican electorate itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:38]</a>.

Examples of this shift include:
*   Tommy Tuberville's actions, which prevented military promotions over abortion policy, created a conflict between military voters and abortion votersâ€”two [[Republican and Democratic Party Factions | factions]] that previously had no major disagreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   [[Potential Issues with Donald Trumps Influence in Future Elections | Donald Trump]] has alienated the business community from the [[Republican and Democratic Party Factions | Republican coalition]] because he disfavored dissent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:27]</a>.

This environment forces Republicans to undergo a [[Challenges in Building Political Party Coalition Consensus | cohesion test]] similar to what Democrats typically face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:35]</a>. Given that Republicans already have fewer voters than Democrats, a failure to maintain their [[Challenges in Building Political Party Coalition Consensus | coalition]]'s unity, especially if [[Potential Issues with Donald Trumps Influence in Future Elections | Donald Trump]] is the candidate, makes winning on numbers alone highly improbable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:56]</a>. This analysis does not even account for the crucial role of [[Impact of independents in elections | Independent voters in American elections]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:06:00]</a>.

Germany faces significant challenges to its modern economy and potential status as a nation-state over the next 20 to 30 years, largely due to three unsolvable problems, one of which is its trade relationship with Russia and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Reliance on Russia for Raw Materials

Historically, Russia has been a primary source for many raw materials vital to German industry, particularly energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Approximately 40% of Germany's coal used to come from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. While Germany has been diligent and successful in reducing its reliance on Russian oil and natural gas, this has come at an exorbitant cost, with energy prices tripling or more since the war in Ukraine began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. If Russian supplies were completely removed from the international market, prices would rise even more significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

As a result of these high energy costs, many energy-intensive companies in sectors like ceramics, steel, and petrochemicals are relocating, as they cannot lower their operating expenses sufficiently within Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This contributes to [[Germanys industrial decline | Germany's industrial decline]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

Even if the Russian political system survives, it is not expected to be a significant commodity exporter because it cannot maintain its own infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### Nord Stream Pipeline Decision

The Nord Stream pipeline, a primary source of natural gas for Germany, was shut down by Russia on September 1, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Russia publicly stated they would not reactivate it unless Germany altered its stance on Ukraine, effectively presenting Germany with a choice: compromise on Ukraine and NATO, or face de-industrialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

Despite a 30-year history of often siding with Russia on energy and security issues, Germany chose to prioritize being Western over maintaining its industrial modernity, accepting the energy crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This [[Germanys shift towards Western alliance | shift towards the Western alliance]] was an unexpected and significant departure from past policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

## Trade Relationship with China

China is another crucial trading partner for Germany, particularly for selling machinery to support China's industrial boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Germany initially "doubled down" on its relationship with China during the first year and a half of the war in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. However, there are now signs that Germany is beginning to inject morality, ethics, and strategic thinking into its trade relationship with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This shift is seen as a necessary move, though it should have occurred years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

Historically, Germany's "Ostpolitik" after the Cold War aimed to keep doors open for relations with the Soviets to calm tensions, a policy that was successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Germany attempted to apply this same approach to Russia and China in the post-Cold War era, but it has not worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

The Chinese system is also expected to decline due to an "atrocious" demographic situation, suggesting it is in its "final decade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This demographic collapse means that China, like Russia, will no longer be a viable trading partner that has contributed to Germany's economic success over the past 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

> [!INFO] Summary of Trade Problems
> Everything that has contributed to Germany's trade success for the last two decades, particularly its relationships with Russia and China, is projected to disappear regardless of current policy decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. The fundamental unsustainability of the German system is a significant factor in [[Germanys industrial decline | Germany's industrial decline]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

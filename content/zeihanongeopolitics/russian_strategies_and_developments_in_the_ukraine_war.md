The [[ukraine_war_and_military_innovation | Ukraine War]] is not in a static state; it consistently sees new tactics and weapon systems being introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>.

## Evolving Military Tactics

Currently, the [[russian_military_strategies_and_advancements_in_ukraine | Russians]] are combining "meat assaults" with a significantly improved level of coordination with other tactics, particularly artillery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:01">[01:26:01]</a>.

While Ukraine has decentralized authority down to the unit level, fostering creativity and effectiveness at that scale, this approach means that successful techniques do not always effectively disseminate upwards to be applied across the entire front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:56">[01:47:56]</a>. This results in very effective commanders but not necessarily a very effective army overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:49">[02:12:49]</a>.

In contrast, [[russian_military_strategies_and_advancements_in_ukraine | Russia]] employs the opposite approach, with very little authority at the local level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:59">[02:17:59]</a>. Although this often allows Ukrainians to outmaneuver them, when a lesson *does* make its way up to the top, it is then imposed on everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:36">[02:27:36]</a>. For the first couple of years of the war, this favored the Ukrainians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:48">[02:33:48]</a>. However, as the [[russian_military_strategies_and_advancements_in_ukraine | Russians]] incrementally incorporate these lessons, the situation is now starting to favor them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>. This has led to the development of an incrementally more effective [[russian_military_strategies_and_advancements_in_ukraine | Russian]] war machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:19">[02:54:19]</a>. To counter this, Ukraine needs better command and control, as well as improved weaponry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:27">[02:44:27]</a>.

## Exploiting International Dynamics

[[Russian involvement and tactics | Russians]] are particularly pleased with the international focus on the conflicts involving Israel, Gaza, and Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:37">[03:15:37]</a>. Any attention the United States dedicates to the Israeli or Gaza situations, or to attacks on maritime shipping in the Red Sea, is attention that cannot be given to the [[Ukraine war and military innovation | Ukraine War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:04">[03:22:04]</a>. The American foreign policy establishment struggles to deal with more than one major issue at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:03">[03:36:03]</a>.

Since the fourth quarter of the previous year, the [[russian_military_strategies_and_advancements_in_ukraine | Russians]] have recognized that they have considerably more operational leeway due to a perceived lack of focused leadership from the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:52">[04:50:52]</a>. It's not a policy change in Washington, but rather a limitation in bandwidth, exacerbated by an election year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:17">[04:59:17]</a>.

[[russian_military_strategies_and_advancements_in_ukraine | Moscow]] is finding new and more creative ways not only to prosecute the war but also to intentionally muddle the broader global picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:52">[05:17:52]</a>. This strategy capitalizes on the American difficulty in focusing on multiple international issues simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:21">[05:25:21]</a>.

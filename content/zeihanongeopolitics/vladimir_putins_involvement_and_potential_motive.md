Following the plane crash in Russia that reportedly killed Yevgeny Prigozhin, leader of the Wagner Group, [[Vladimir Putins governance style and background | Vladimir Putin]] is considered the primary suspect among those who might have wanted Prigozhin dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Reasons for Potential Involvement

[[Vladimir Putins governance style and background | Putin's]] motive stems from Prigozhin's actions, particularly the "pseudo coup" launched a few weeks prior to his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Prigozhin publicly insulted the entire military-industrial complex of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This public challenge led [[Vladimir Putins governance style and background | Putin]] to feel he had "an axe to grind" and that Prigozhin needed to be "snipped" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

Historically, [[Vladimir Putins governance style and background | Putin]] relied on Prigozhin to carry out "unsavory things" over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This included the "meat grinder assault" in Bakhmut, Ukraine, which resulted in significant Russian casualties, estimated at a minimum of 30,000 soldiers, with some suggestions of up to 100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Prigozhin's Rise Under [[Vladimir Putins governance style and background | Putin]]

Prigozhin initially gained [[Vladimir Putins governance style and background | Putin's]] attention as a caterer who expressed strong opinions that aligned with [[Vladimir Putins governance style and background | Putin's]] preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This led to direct "FaceTime" with [[Vladimir Putins governance style and background | Putin]], resulting in money and state contracts that ultimately facilitated the creation of the Wagner military group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## [[Vladimir Putins governance style and background | Putin's]] Coalition and Inner Circle

[[Vladimir Putins governance style and background | Vladimir Putin's]] ruling coalition is composed of former intelligence operatives from the KGB (now FSB) and organized crime figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The military itself is distinct and not part of this backing coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Within this inner circle and the world of organized crime, there were many individuals who might have wanted Prigozhin dead, either because he had wronged them or because he was a stepping stone in their own pursuit of [[Vladimir Putins governance style and background | Putin's]] favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## Post-Death Implications

Prigozhin's death creates an "opening" within [[Vladimir Putins governance style and background | Putin's]] Inner Circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. His role was crucial for the Russian state, providing a source of "plausible deniability" for various operations, including the "little green men" actions in Crimea in 2014, interference in US elections, and military operations in African countries where he was accused of war crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This vital role means someone will step forward to fill the void, and the question remains whether this new individual will be a trusted ally of [[Vladimir Putins governance style and background | Putin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

The United States has increasingly disengaged from its traditional role in safeguarding international energy markets and maritime trade. This shift is highlighted by its response to incidents like the seizure of oil tankers by Iran, indicating a major change from decades of established US foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Recent Incidents and US Response

On April 27th, a Suez Max oil tanker named the *Advantage Sweet* was seized by Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The vessel, owned by a Turkish company and registered in the Marshall Islands, was likely carrying about 800,000 barrels of crude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. In response, the U.S. Navy issued a press release that amounted to "bad Iran, very very bad Iran," with no further action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

This limited response serves as a reminder that the US "just doesn't care anymore" when it comes to international energy markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Any nations wishing to address Iran's tanker seizures must do so without US involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Historical Context of US Engagement

Historically, the US's role in protecting global resource and product flows was a cornerstone of the American post-World War II global environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This policy existed not because the United States heavily imported oil from the Middle East—it never did significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>—but because its allies did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

This arrangement allowed US allies to reduce their own military expenditures, particularly against the Soviet Union, in exchange for US protection of economic interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This strategic trade-off provided the US with a free hand and control over its allies' militaries in the event of a confrontation with the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## The [[shift_in_us_global_strategic_role | Shift in US Global Strategic Role]]

The [[shift_in_us_global_strategic_role | United States has steadily reduced its commitment to the maritime order]] that underpins global trade and energy markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This trend has been observed across multiple administrations, including Obama, Trump, and Biden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The return of Russia, while significant, does not present the same global threat as the former Soviet Union, removing a key rationale for the US's previous commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Implications for Other Nations

The US's [[the_impact_of_us_disengagement_from_the_middle_east | disengagement]] has significant implications for other global powers, particularly China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. China's economy and strategic position rely on the assumption that the United States will uphold civilian freedom of the seas, regardless of other geopolitical actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. However, the US no longer has an interest in this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

In the event of a significant [[global_and_regional_economic_consequences_of_an_oil_disruption | disruption to international energy flows]], the US, being self-sufficient within North America, would likely close its borders to energy trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This would leave China at the end of a long supply line with no means of protection, potentially leading to de-industrialization and the end of China's unified nation-state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

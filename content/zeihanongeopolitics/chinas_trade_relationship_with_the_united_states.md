China is the world's largest importer of various essential commodities, including energy, foodstuffs, materials required for food production, and nearly every mineral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The country produces very little raw material internally; instead, it largely imports these materials, processes them, transforms them into value-added goods, and then exports them, primarily as manufactured products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This economic structure makes China vulnerable to cut-offs at all stages of the production chain across every industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Dependence on Imports
China's economy is highly dependent on international trade. Its reliance on imports is comprehensive:
*   **Energy**: China is the largest global importer of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Approximately 80% of its oil imports pass through the Strait of Malacca <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Food**: China relies on imports for foodstuffs and the materials needed to grow food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Minerals**: The country imports every mineral it requires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Vulnerabilities in Stockpiling
Despite [[potential_conflict_scenarios_between_china_and_the_united_states | China's stockpiling]] of foods, fuels, and materials in preparation for a prolonged conflict with the [[Canadas relationship with the United States | United States]], this strategy is unlikely to be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Limited Capacity**: Even if China reaches its goal of 120 days of import cover for oil, this supply would only last for 120 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Storage Limitations**: Unlike the United States, China lacks extensive salt domes for secure underground storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Consequently, much of its stockpiling must occur above ground, making these reserves vulnerable to missile attacks and potentially lost within the first few days of a "hot War" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Perishability**: Attempts at large-scale food storage, such as a massive corn storage facility that consisted of giant piles along the road, resulted in widespread spoilage within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Reliance on Exports
[[Chinas economic dependency on exports | China's ability to pay for its crucial imports]] is contingent on its capacity to export goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The [[USChina relations and tech investment | United States]] is China's primary customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Strategic Miscalculations in Conflict Scenarios
In the event of a conflict between the US and China, China's "battle plan" appears to involve several strategic miscalculations:
*   The Chinese plan assumes the [[Canadas economic and trade relations with the United States | United States]] Navy would sail within sight of the Chinese shore, allowing China's Air Force to engage them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   It also assumes the US would continue to patrol global oceans, ensuring China can still import food and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   Furthermore, the plan expects the United States to keep its market open, allowing China to continue exporting goods and pay for its imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

This strategy is considered "stupid" as it relies on the adversary's cooperation to maintain China's vital supply chains and export markets during a conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. If a real fight were to occur, China would find itself in a dire situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

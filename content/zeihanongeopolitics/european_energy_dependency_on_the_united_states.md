Former President Donald Trump proposed that European nations should purchase American oil and gas to address trade deficits and solidify alliances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. While the feasibility of this specific proposal is questionable due to typical policy implementation challenges under Trump, it presents an interesting hypothetical exercise given the ongoing reshaping of the global order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## European Energy Consumption
Europe, broadly defined to include the Balkans, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and all of the European Union, consumes approximately 13 million barrels of crude oil per day (including refined products) and about 45 billion cubic feet of natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This usage represents roughly 50% to 60% of what the United States consumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Although Europe has a larger population than the United States, its economy is smaller and less energy-intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Much of Europe is currently de-industrializing due to shortages in energy, workers, and finance, tied to a broader [[european_demographic_trends_and_economic_impacts | demographic story]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## US Capacity to Fuel Europe
For the United States to fuel Europe, it would need to expand its oil production by 2-4 million barrels per day, a level of expansion that is likely to occur organically within the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Regarding natural gas, significant liquified natural gas (LNG) export capacity would need to be built, requiring a doubling or nearly tripling of current capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Projects currently in the pipeline suggest this could be achieved within the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. From a purely numerical standpoint, supplying Europe with energy is not an "ridiculous idea" for the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Challenges and Strategic Implications of a US Supply Shift
Redirecting all U.S. energy exports to Europe would pose several challenges:
*   **Existing Export Destinations**: The primary destination for U.S. energy exports is currently Mexico, where American natural gas generates about half of their electricity and over a million barrels per day of crude and refined products are supplied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Without these exports, Mexico would face significant energy shortfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Japan is the second-largest destination, and it is considered a much tighter ally than many European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Trade Deficit Misconception**: Merely redirecting existing sales from one country to another would not resolve a trade deficit; it would simply create a new trade imbalance elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Strategic Block Formation**: In a de-globalizing world, the issue is not finding buyers for U.S. commodity exports, but rather which allies the U.S. chooses to support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Making a strategic decision to pour all U.S. energy exports into Europe could create a viable strategic bloc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This partnership could keep Russia contained and provide the U.S. with influence in the Middle East without direct military presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This alignment could lead to "fusion" in agriculture, manufacturing, and military capabilities, establishing an American-dominated system encompassing the cultural West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Merging North America and Europe is argued to be arguably the most powerful option in a world breaking into factions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Trade-offs and Alternative Alliances
Committing all U.S. energy resources to Europe would mean sacrificing the ability to provide similar support to other advanced countries like Korea and Japan, or rapidly growing regions like Southeast Asia (e.g., Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, Indonesia, Malaysia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. The U.S. will need to make difficult choices about its alliances in a de-globalizing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

Pouring energy resources into Europe, a region experiencing a [[european_demographic_trends_and_economic_impacts | demographic decline]], might not yield the "biggest bang for the buck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. For example, Germany's industrial base is projected to collapse within a decade due to a lack of workforce in addition to energy problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

As the Eurozone faces challenges, particularly a consumption-led economy without a strong currency, the U.S. may choose to work with individual European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Countries like France, the UK, and Spain appear more viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Central Europe may endure longer than Germany, and Italy, despite its demographic issues, offers a more favorable geography for power projection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## Feasibility of US Policy Implementation
The likelihood of Donald Trump's stated policies, such as the European energy proposal, coming to fruition is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Policy Survival**: Many of Trump's statements do not evolve beyond initial pronouncements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Cabinet Incompetence**: His tendency to appoint "functional incompetence" to cabinet positions further diminishes the chances of policy implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The primary purpose of cabinet members under Trump is to flatter his ego, leading to rapid turnover; in his first term, he had more cabinet secretaries than any other three U.S. presidents combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This instability prevents meaningful policy discussion and practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Poor Personnel Management**: Trump is regarded as one of the worst personnel managers among U.S. presidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, comparable to Barack Obama who micromanaged but was unavailable for engagement, leading to little policy action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Lack of Leadership**: Over the past 16 years, spanning the Trump, Biden, and Obama administrations, there has been a lack of effective leadership to guide the conversation or implement policies for a de-globalizing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. While Trump is credited for initiating the conversation on potential strategic realignments, the specific idea of Europe simply buying American energy "doesn't take us very far" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

From: [[zeihanongeopolitics]] <br/> 

[[chinas_economic_strategies_and_challenges | China]] has been actively stockpiling various essential resources, including foods, fuels, and raw materials, with the stated goal of surviving a protracted conflict with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. However, the effectiveness of this strategy is highly questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## China's Fundamental Economic Vulnerabilities

[[chinas_economic_strategies_and_challenges | China]] is the world's largest importer of energy, foodstuffs, and the materials needed to grow food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Furthermore, it imports virtually every mineral, as very little raw material is produced within [[chinas_economic_strategies_and_challenges | China]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The [[chinas_economic_strategies_and_challenges | Chinese]] economic model relies on importing raw materials, processing them into value-added manufactured goods, and then exporting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This reliance means [[chinas_economic_strategies_and_challenges | China]] is highly vulnerable to cut-offs at every stage of the production chain across all industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Challenges with Stockpiling Specific Resources

While [[chinas_economic_strategies_and_challenges | China]] is indeed storing large quantities of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, the practicalities and vulnerabilities of this strategy limit its potential impact.

### Fuel Stockpiles

[[chinas_economic_strategies_and_challenges | China]] aims to achieve 120 days of import cover for oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. However, this supply would only last 120 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Unlike the United States, [[chinas_economic_strategies_and_challenges | China]] lacks large underground salt domes suitable for secure storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Consequently, much of its storage must be above ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This makes stockpiled fuel highly susceptible to missile attacks, meaning it could be destroyed within the first few days of a hot war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Furthermore, [[chinas_economic_strategies_and_challenges | China]] is vulnerable to disruptions by United States sea power not just along its coast, but anywhere that can interrupt trade routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The Strait of Malacca is particularly sensitive, as approximately 80% of [[potential_consequences_for_chinas_economy_due_to_oil_supply_disruptions | China's oil imports]] flow through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Food Stockpiles

Similar challenges apply to food storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Storing food requires proper facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. An example of past failures includes a massive [[chinas_economic_strategies_and_challenges | Chinese]] corn storage facility that consisted of large piles of corn along the roadside, which rotted within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Flawed Assumptions in China's Strategic Planning

Even if [[chinas_economic_strategies_and_challenges | China]] could effectively stockpile energy, food, and raw material inputs, its strategic plan hinges on fundamentally flawed assumptions about a conflict with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

[[chinas_economic_dependency_on_exports | China]] remains highly dependent on exports, with the United States being its number one customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The [[chinas_economic_strategies_and_challenges | Chinese]] battle plan appears to assume that in a conflict:
*   The United States Navy would sail close enough to the [[chinas_economic_strategies_and_challenges | Chinese]] shore to be vulnerable to the [[chinas_economic_strategies_and_challenges | Chinese]] Air Force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   The United States would continue to patrol the global oceans, allowing [[chinas_economic_strategies_and_challenges | China]] to import all the food and energy it needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   The United States would keep its market open, enabling [[chinas_economic_strategies_and_challenges | China]] to earn the revenue required to pay for its imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

This strategic outlook is considered illogical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Should a real conflict occur between the United States and [[chinas_economic_strategies_and_challenges | China]], the [[chinas_potential_collapse_and_its_impact_on_global_industry | Chinese]] economy would face severe and immediate consequences due to its deep reliance on global trade and access to international markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

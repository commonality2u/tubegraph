Ukrainian forces are preparing for a major offensive expected in the coming months, building on recent significant arms packages from Europe and the United States, as well as the upcoming delivery of F-16 fighter jets from NATO countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This preparation aims to address previous challenges and leverage new capabilities.

## Preparation of the Battlefield

Ukrainian strategy has become increasingly aggressive in recent weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Current efforts are focused on shaping the battlefield to enable the future offensive:
*   **Neutralizing [[russian_military_strategies_and_advancements_in_ukraine | Russian Assaults]]** They have turned the [[russian_military_strategies_and_advancements_in_ukraine | Russian assault]] in Kharkiv into a "killing ground" for [[russian_military_strategies_and_advancements_in_ukraine | Russian troops]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Counter-Assaults** Ukrainian forces have increased the pace of counter-assaults south of the Dnieper River, inflicting heavy casualties on [[russian_military_strategies_and_advancements_in_ukraine | Russian]] forces, with some battles seeing casualty ratios of 20:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Targeting Air Assets** A key part of the [[ukrainian_military_strategy_and_territorial_gains | Ukrainian military strategy]] involves using mid-range rockets and missiles to strike [[russian_military_strategies_and_advancements_in_ukraine | Russian aviation assets]] deep within Russia, sometimes as far as 500 miles from the border, and throughout the Crimean Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Destroying Air Defenses** Specifically, [[ukrainian_military_strategy_and_territorial_gains | Ukraine]] is targeting [[russian_military_strategies_and_advancements_in_ukraine | Russian]] anti-aircraft batteries, including the S-300s and the advanced S-400s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The S-400s are considered among the best in the world; in the past two weeks, [[ukrainian_military_strategy_and_territorial_gains | Ukraine]] has destroyed at least four such batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This aims to deny [[russian_military_strategies_and_advancements_in_ukraine | Russia]] air defense capabilities before the F-16s arrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Strategic Radar Systems** [[ukrainian_military_strategy_and_territorial_gains | Ukraine]] has also been successful in taking out numerous strategic radar systems deep within [[russian_military_strategies_and_advancements_in_ukraine | Russian]] territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Overcoming Past Limitations

Previous [[ukrainian_military_strategy_and_territorial_gains | Ukrainian counter-offensives]] in 2022 and 2023 were successful in exploiting unfortified [[russian_military_strategies_and_advancements_in_ukraine | Russian]] positions, leading to massive casualties and retreats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. However, as the [[RussiaUkraine conflict and US interests | war]] progressed, [[russian_military_strategies_and_advancements_in_ukraine | Russia]] established multi-layered defenses, including extensive minefields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

While NATO trained [[ukrainian_military_strategy_and_territorial_gains | Ukrainian]] forces in combined arms operations (infantry, mounted infantry, tanks, helicopters, missiles, aircraft), [[ukrainian_military_strategy_and_territorial_gains | Ukraine]] lacked the necessary air power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This allowed [[russian_military_strategies_and_advancements_in_ukraine | Russian]] artillery strikes to bog down [[ukrainian_military_strategy_and_territorial_gains | Ukrainian]] advances, resulting in minimal gains despite significant casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

The current [[ukrainian_military_strategy_and_territorial_gains | Ukrainian]] strategy aims to establish regional or local air superiority, allowing F-16s to operate in a less contested environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This would enable [[ukrainian_military_strategy_and_territorial_gains | Ukraine]] to concentrate forces and strike [[russian_military_strategies_and_advancements_in_ukraine | Russian]] targets with artillery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Potential Outcomes

### Air Superiority Over Crimea
If the F-16s arrive in about a month and [[ukrainian_military_strategy_and_territorial_gains | Ukraine]] proves adept at utilizing them, they could achieve regional air superiority over most of the Crimean Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### Isolation of Southern Front
With air superiority, [[ukrainian_military_strategy_and_territorial_gains | Ukraine]] could easily cut the remaining infrastructure links from [[russian_military_strategies_and_advancements_in_ukraine | Russia]] proper to the southern front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Only two key links remain:
*   The Kerch Bridge, which is already damaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   A supplementary rail system through occupied [[ukrainian_military_strategy_and_territorial_gains | Ukraine]] on the southern coast, already within artillery range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### Logistical Collapse and Political Humiliation
The objective is to leverage superior speed, innovation, and reach to disrupt [[russian_strategies and developments in the Ukraine war | Russian logistical capabilities]], isolate large pockets of troops, and create political humiliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Such humiliation has, in the past, led to a [[strategic_and_diplomatic_implications_for_russia | Russian]] "climb down" or even a collapse of the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Potential Decisive Conflicts
These preparations suggest that "decisive conflicts" could occur later in the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### Geopolitical Consequences
A major [[shift_in_ukraine_war_dynamics | military defeat]] has historically been a trigger for the collapse of about half of [[strategic_and_diplomatic_implications_for_russia | Russian governments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. A potential success in Crimea could be the first battle of the [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_us_interests | war]] to fall into this category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

### Limitations
Even if [[ukrainian_military_strategy_and_territorial_gains | Ukraine]] were to fully capture Crimea, the [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_us_interests | war]] would not necessarily be over, as [[russian_strategies and developments in the Ukraine war | Russian logistics]] in the Donbas region of eastern [[ukrainian_military_strategy_and_territorial_gains | Ukraine]] are far more robust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

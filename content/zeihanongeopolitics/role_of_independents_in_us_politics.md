In American elections, the role of [[independent_voters_in_american_elections | independent voters]] is crucial, particularly given the strong partisan divides within the Republican and Democratic parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.

## Categories of Voters
The electorate can be broadly categorized:
*   **Hardcore Partisans** Approximately 20-25% of the electorate are either hardcore Republican or hardcore Democrat. These voters will support their party's candidate, regardless of personal feelings towards them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.
*   **Nominal Independents** Another roughly 20% on each side self-identify as independent, but in approximately 85% of races, they vote for either a Republican or a Democrat. These voters are considered subsidiaries of the left and right within the American system, with little room for sway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.
*   **True Independents** Only about 10% of the American electorate is truly [[independent_voters_in_american_elections | independent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:50">[06:48:50]</a>. These voters are described as "wishy-washy," "judgmental," and prone to "buyers' remorse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. They often feel they are "handed this palette that we just don't like" and have to make do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.

## Impact on Elections
Historically, the votes of this last 10% of [[independent_voters_in_american_elections | independent voters]] are the primary reason why the party in power typically loses seats in midterm elections, as these voters experience "buyer's remorse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:03">[07:00:03]</a>. Their usual pattern is to vote against the incumbent party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.

These [[independent_voters_in_american_elections | independents]] have been decisive in the last seven general elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.

### The 2022 Midterm Anomaly
The 2022 midterms showed a significant shift in the behavior of [[independent_voters_in_american_elections | independents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. Despite polling as disliking Joe Biden, particularly regarding his economic policies which they viewed as contrary to their own economic interests, these [[independent_voters_in_american_elections | independents]] decisively sided with Democrats in critical races <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:03">[07:50:03]</a>.

The reason for this unusual voting pattern stemmed from their concern that if the Republican Party, under Donald Trump, were to change the [[us_electoral_system_and_its_effect_on_political_parties | electoral system]] as they desired, then swing voters and [[independent_voters_in_american_elections | independent voters]] would no longer matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. Since the general election is the only arena where [[independent_voters_in_american_elections | independents]] exert influence, removing that influence would render them powerless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>. Additionally, Trump's emphasis on personal loyalty led to "crap candidates" who were easy to vote against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.

This strong turnout and voting pattern from [[independent_voters_in_american_elections | independents]] in 2022, even against their perceived economic interests, suggests they will likely show up in the next general election and vote against Trump and what he represents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.

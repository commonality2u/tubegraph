A common question regarding the [[potential_collapse_of_chinese_economy_and_governance | potential collapse of the Chinese system]] is whether it would provoke a "diversionary war" to increase public support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. While it cannot be entirely ruled out, there are several reasons why such a war is unlikely to occur for traditional reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Why a Diversionary War is Unlikely

### China's Political System and Public Opinion Control
China is an autocracy, not a democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The [[chinas_political_system_and_public_opinion_control | CCP's control of the public space]] and its ability to shape public opinion are immense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. In this environment, there isn't the same "rally to the flag" effect, nor does economic instability create the same level of societal unrest as in more pluralistic societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The government's capacity to shape public opinion and stir nationalism is robust, with the challenge often being to contain it rather than to ignite it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. From a legitimacy standpoint, a diversionary war is not seen as necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Economic and Strategic Vulnerabilities
Any informed person in China understands that launching a war for Taiwan would not end well for China in the aftermath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Energy Dependence**: China relies on the international community for roughly three-quarters of its energy sources, most of which come from a continent away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Trade Dependence**: In terms of absolute volumes, China is the most dependent country globally on imports and exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Food Security**: China imports the vast majority of materials needed to grow its own food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

A moderate effort by a small number of countries to target Chinese commerce in the aftermath of a war would lead to an [[chinas_industrial_and_political_challenges | industrial collapse]] within months and potentially result in the death of half the population within a couple of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The Chinese leadership, at least several years ago, understood these severe consequences, primarily using Taiwan as a rhetorical issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Limited Strategic Gain from Taiwan
Even if China could capture Taiwan quickly with minimal damage, it would not provide significant strategic benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Island Chain**: While it technically breaks the first island chain, China would still depend on the international system for its needs and on the U.S. Navy for global ocean patrols to secure its commercial cargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Maritime Risk**: Taking Taiwan would actually put potential Chinese maritime shipping at greater risk from the Japanese Navy, which has a longer range than China's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Semiconductor Industry**: The Taiwanese semiconductor industry, particularly its advanced facilities, relies on foreign equipment, software, and personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. China, or any other country taking it over, would not be able to operate these facilities effectively for at least a decade, and likely much longer for China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Potential, Unconventional Reasons for War

Despite the unsuitability and detrimental outcomes of a diversionary war, it cannot be entirely ruled out. The rationale, however, would be very different from typical geopolitical calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### Miscalculation by Xi Jinping
A war could occur due to a miscalculation by [[impact_of_xi_jinping_leadership_on_chinas_governance | Xi Jinping]] himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Due to the tight [[centralized_power_in_china_under_xi_jinping | Cult of Personality]] he has fostered, information is not being brought to him, meaning he makes decisions in isolation, unaware of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. In such a decision-making structure, he could "pull the trigger" for reasons unknown to outside observers, unrelated to conventional economic, strategic, or political drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### A "Darker" Rationale: Controlling the Narrative of Collapse
If one believes that the [[challenges_facing_chinas_future | Chinese system is facing its end]] within the next decade, primarily due to demographic reasons (forgetting politics, energy, debt, trade wars, etc.), there could be a compelling, albeit amoral, reason for the CCP to initiate a war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

If China is already facing an inevitable [[chinas_industrial_and_political_challenges | industrial collapse]] and [[potential_collapse_of_chinese_economy_and_governance | population collapse]] that the government cannot prevent (only perhaps slightly delay), then choosing the time and place of a war—even if it's a losing effort that would result in the death of half the population—could allow the CCP to command the narrative of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Amoral Calculation
> For the low price of half the country's population, the CCP might believe it could rule into the next era of Chinese history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Such an amoral calculation could be a compelling, albeit dark, reason to launch a self-destructive war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

This specific, dire scenario for the [[potential_outcomes_after_xi_jinping_death | future of Chinese leadership decision-making]] cannot be ruled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

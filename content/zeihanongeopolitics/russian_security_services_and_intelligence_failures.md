A recent terror attack in Russia, claimed by the Islamic State Khorasan (ISK), has highlighted significant intelligence and security failures within the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The attack in Moscow claimed at least 130 lives and left over 100 people hospitalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Unheeded Intelligence Warnings

The United States had specifically warned Russia of an impending attack on concert locations as early as March 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. When the Russians did not take the warning seriously, the Americans made the information public to allow U.S. citizens in the area to be aware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

Despite these clear warnings, Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed the intelligence. He held a press conference where he "was almost giggling" about the warning, labeling it as a "fake warning intended to destabilize Russian society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The attack subsequently occurred, revealing "the degree of sheer [[russian_military_incompetence | incompetence]] in the Russian Security Services to not even deal with that information and just let the attack unfold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Russian Attempts to Link to Ukraine

Publicly, the Russians are attempting to link the attack to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. While they no longer claim Ukrainians carried out the attack, they suggest the attackers were heading for Ukraine because Ukrainians had supposedly opened a gap in the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This assertion is considered "silly" given other "better places in Russia to just melt away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. It is more likely the attackers came through southern borders like Azerbaijan or Kazakhstan, where security is very thin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Internal Vulnerabilities and Demographics

The attack is likely to motivate numerous ethnic groups within the Russian Federation, including Chechens, Dagestanis, Tadzhiks, and Bashkirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Over 10% of the Russian population is Muslim, and republics on Russia's southern border are predominantly Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

These internal groups, many of whom are already anti-Moscow, could be inspired by such events, potentially leading to a "broad-based uprising or even just multiple pinpricks of terror attacks on an ongoing basis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

Russia's demographics are a contributing factor to its current situation. The decision to launch the Ukraine war was partly due to "terminal" demographics, with an anticipated shortage of people in their 20s for military service by 2030-2035 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Furthermore, over 20% (and possibly closer to 30%) of Russia's population is not ethnic Russian, with the majority being Muslims or Ukrainians who are unhappy with their situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This creates a volatile scenario of a "rising demographic that is now starting to develop a pension for civic violence against declining population that is desperate to hold on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Putin's Strategic Errors

President Putin, a former intelligence agent, has made a "series of strategic errors in the security field" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. These include misjudging the wider world, how Ukraine would fall, and interpreting security information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. These failures are coming to a head shortly after his highly controlled "election party" where he received 80% of the vote by not running against other candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

While a revolution in Russia is not immediately predicted, attacks like this can create cracks in the system's "brittle" facade, potentially initiating "something fundamentally new" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. History suggests that such events can be turning points in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

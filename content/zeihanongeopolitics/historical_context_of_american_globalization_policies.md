The United States' engagement in globalization was primarily driven by security concerns rather than traditional economic advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. While the U.S. had the world's largest economy before World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, post-war, the combined economies of all potential rivals, allies, and enemies matched its size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. In this environment, economic growth was difficult, and security was elusive due to historical competition over resources, land, and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Cold War Strategy

Facing the Soviet Union in Europe, the U.S. concluded that it could not economically or politically sustain a conflict far from its shores, especially on the devastated territories of European nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The American solution was to "bribe" other nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

This involved:
*   Using the U.S. Navy to patrol global oceans, ensuring allies could freely access materials and interact with any player globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   Granting access to the American market, which was the only one of significant size to survive the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

The condition for these benefits was that allies had to allow the U.S. to dictate their security policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Thus, from its inception, American globalization was fundamentally about security – "we pay you to be on our side" – rather than purely economics or trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

This strategy proved effective for 40-45 years, leading to the end of the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The Soviet system could not compete against an alliance of economies that became "massively larger" than their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. For example, by the 1980s, South Korea, once the world's fifth poorest country, had surpassed the Soviet Union in per capita terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Shift Towards Deglobalization

Over the last 30-35 years, the world entered an era of "hyper-globalization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, with more countries beyond the West and Asian protectorates, such as Southeast Asia, Brazil, India, Russia, and China, participating under U.S.-established rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

This expansion altered the landscape:
*   The U.S. economy is no longer as large as all other economies combined; the rest of the world is now three to four times its size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   The indirect economic subsidization the U.S. provided for 45 years became increasingly untenable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### Current Challenges Leading to [[deglobalization_and_its_impact_on_american_industry|Deglobalization]]

Several factors contribute to the current shift away from globalization, making it difficult for the U.S. to reverse course:

#### 1. Political Realignment
American politics during the Cold War featured a strong bipartisan foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. However, U.S. foreign policy reflects domestic politics, and every generation or two, Americans redefine their political parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Significant changes over the past 35 years—the end of the Cold War, the rise and fall of hyper-globalization, demographic shifts, and the information revolution—have altered political dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

This has led to a realignment of political factions, none of which currently support globalization:
*   Unions have largely shifted away from the Democratic coalition, with the Trump coalition successfully attracting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Unions are largely anti-free trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   The Trump administration alienated the business community and national security conservatives from the Republican coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. These two groups were historically the most pro-globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   Both the Biden administration and the Trump-led Republican coalition are now vying for union support, leading to a reluctance in Washington to discuss globalization positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

#### 2. Demographics
The process of urbanization and industrialization, which began earlier in the rich world (75 years ago) and later in the developing world (40 years ago) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, leads to fewer children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Consequently, the world is running out of people under 20, and increasingly, under 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

The fundamental premise of trade and globalization is dependent on consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The traditional consumers—people aged 45 and under who are having families and buying homes and cars—no longer exist in sufficient numbers to sustain the global system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Countries like China and Russia are the fastest-aging societies, with Germany, Korea, Indonesia, India, and Brazil also aging rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. By 2040-2045, the average American will be younger than the average Brazilian, and 10 years later, younger than the average Indian, Indonesian, or Mexican <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

## Current Policy Stance

The U.S. no longer has the security parameters or economic basis to make globalization work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. The current political climate, focused on domestic issues and union alignment, will further entrench anti-globalization policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

Even major global events like the Ukraine war have not shifted the U.S. back to a pro-globalization stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. The Biden administration's deals are primarily security-focused, not trade-focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. In fact, the Biden administration has doubled and tripled down on most tariffs and trade wars initiated by the Trump administration, with only one exception (an aerospace deal with Europeans) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. The Biden administration is arguably more anti-globalization than its predecessor, hardening anti-globalization sentiment into long-term policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

It would take several years for a future pro-globalization president to unwind these policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. By then, the global landscape will have drastically changed, for example, with China's demographic decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

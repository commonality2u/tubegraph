The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has highlighted the [[significance_of_logistics_and_infrastructure_in_warfare | critical significance of logistics and infrastructure]] in modern warfare, with various incidents severely impacting Russian military capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

## Capture of Rostov-on-Don

The city of Rostov-on-Don was captured by the Wagner paramilitary group leader, Prigozhin, over the course of June 23rd, 24th, and 25th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>. This city serves as the primary logistical and communications point for the Russian military in the entire Ukrainian War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. Its capture means that it is currently impossible for any Russian forces in Crimea or occupied Ukraine to receive reinforcements, new troops, equipment, or fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>. This situation presents a "golden opportunity" for Ukrainian forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>.

## Ukrainian Counter-Offensive Strategy Shift

The Ukrainian counter-offensive, initially facing difficulties against Russian defensive lines, has shifted its military strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Prior to the capture of Rostov-on-Don, the offensive was not progressing well, with Ukrainian forces struggling to breach Russian minefields and defensive emplacements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

Since the 23rd, Ukrainian forces changed their targeting strategy from command and control bunkers to [[impact_on_russian_ammunition_depots | ammunition dumps]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. This shift is typically undertaken before a major push to disrupt enemy forces and prevent them from receiving meaningful supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.

### Targeting Critical Supply Routes

A key development was the targeting of critical supply bridges for Russian forces on June 22nd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>:

*   **Chonhar Bridge (Crimea)**: The Chonhar Bridge, which includes both rail and road connections, was hit by missiles, rendering its rail system completely impassable until repairs are done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>. This damage, caused by special warheads designed to penetrate concrete and rebar, means trucks and trains cannot cross <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. While the Russians have the technical capacity for repairs, it is expected to take weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.
*   **Kerch Bridge (Crimea)**: An earlier attack on the Kerch Bridge last summer damaged one of its two-lane road connections and warped the rail connection, making it impossible for cargo trains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. This forced Russia to rely on land connections into Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>. Months later, the rail connection has still not been rebuilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>.

These attacks have created a window where the Russians in the western half of the front, from Melitopol west, are unable to function effectively due to supply disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

## [[Consequences for Russian logistics and transport | Consequences for Russian Logistics and Transport]]

The combination of the Kerch and Chonhar bridge damages has severely constrained Russian supply routes into Crimea and southern Ukraine:

*   The Kerch Bridge, formerly the primary route into Crimea, now has only two of its four road lanes operational, and trains cannot use the rail connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.
*   With the Chonhar Bridge offline, any cargo going to and from Ukraine must now use the single western land connection, which is less efficient and further from the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>.

As a result, Russian troops west of the city of Mariupol have been effectively cut off from supplies coming from Russia proper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. It will take approximately a week for the Russians to reroute all supplies further west, increasing the distance and complexity of transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.

> Russia's ability to repair critical infrastructure is hampered by a collapse in technical education and a demographic crisis stemming from the Soviet dissolution, leading to a shortage of skilled technical experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.

These [[destruction_of_russian_logistics_and_supply_lines | disruptions to Russian logistics and supply lines]] have profound [[impact_of_equipment_and_manpower_shortages_on_russian_military | implications for their military operations]]:

*   **Isolation of Forces**: Russian soldiers in occupied Ukraine, particularly those in the Melitopol area, are now completely cut off and vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>. They will not receive reinforcements, fuel, artillery shells, or ammunition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>.
*   **Ukrainian Opportunity**: This situation provides an ideal opportunity for Ukraine to launch a major push towards the Sea of Azov, aiming to cut the land bridge to Crimea permanently and directly target the Kerch Bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>. Such an advance would effectively isolate Crimea and the southwestern front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.
*   **[[impact_on_russian_military_operations_in_crimea | Impact on Russian Military Operations in Crimea]]**: With Rostov-on-Don, the primary jumping-off point for Russian forces into Crimea and the southern front, offline, it's impossible to reinforce or resupply forces in Crimea or occupied Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.

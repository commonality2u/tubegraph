The [[chinas_economic_strategies_and_challenges | Chinese economy]] is currently facing significant hurdles, with growth targets unlikely to be met and a situation closer to a borderline recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This downturn initiated in the fourth quarter of 2019 with the onset of COVID-19 and has largely persisted since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Unreliable Economic Data

Official Chinese statistics, which aim for a 5% GDP growth, are considered unreliable by private analysts and elements within the Chinese bureaucratic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The system's design encourages exaggerated data, making figures at both local and national levels potentially useless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. A forensic audit might even reveal that the overall [[chinas_postcovid_economic_challenges | Chinese economy]] has remained relatively stagnant throughout this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Ineffective Stimulus Measures and Demographic Challenges

Recent measures, such as adjusting mortgage rates and reducing bank reserve requirements, are considered only "mildly stimulatory" and fail to address the fundamental problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. A key issue is the [[chinas_demographic_challenges | demographic challenge]]: China has a shrinking population under 50, limiting the consumption base that can be stimulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Furthermore, the government under Chairman Xi Jinping does not prioritize private consumption as a significant driver of economic growth, viewing personal spending as potentially alien to state-centric ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. These [[demographic_and_economic_challenges_facing_china | demographic and economic challenges]] compound the situation.

## The Broken Banking System

A core issue contributing to the [[chinas_industrial_and_political_challenges | challenges facing China's future]] is its banking system, which is described as "completely broken" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
China's economic activity has been encouraged by compelling banks to lend extensively at near-zero or negative real interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. While this can initially generate growth, it leads to instability and is likened to past financial crises in the United States, such as subprime lending, Enron, or the Savings and Loan crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Non-Performing Loans (NPLs)

When loans go bad, they become "non-performing loans" (NPLs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. In the U.S., a 1.5% NPL ratio would trigger government intervention, and a 2% ratio often leads to bank failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. In China, where profit margins on loans are often zero or negative, the problem is exacerbated by a lack of fiduciary responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
Internal estimates place China's total NPL ratio for its banking sector between 5.5% and 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, indicating that, on average, the entire banking sector is effectively "out of luck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### Geographic Disparities

While coastal banks generally maintain tighter operations due to international investment and trade, banks in the interior, particularly in poorer, agricultural regions, are less stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. These interior banks, often state-owned or regional, are heavily impacted by the NPL crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## Outlook

Addressing the [[chinas_demographic_and_economic_challenges | demographic and economic challenges facing China]] requires restructuring the banking sector and disposing of these NPLs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Historically, this has only occurred in the U.S. during recessions linked to the financial sector, such as the 2007-2009 subprime crisis or the 1980s Savings and Loan crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. China's situation is at least an order of magnitude worse, and given the U.S. economy's relative strength, China's challenges are even more severe in comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Current attempts to ease credit will only worsen the inevitable financial crash because underlying issues remain unaddressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

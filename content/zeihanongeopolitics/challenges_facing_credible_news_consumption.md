A well-informed population is crucial, as propaganda thrives in environments where people lack access to multiple, credible sources of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. For a populace to be well-informed, there must be agreement on basic facts, a principle that no longer fully exists in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Decline of Credible Media
The erosion of fact-based reporting and the rise of misinformation has deep roots in changes within the media industry, significantly impacting the [[impact_of_technology_on_media_credibility | credibility of media]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

### Historical Context of Media Structure
Historically, every sizable newspaper in the U.S., along with larger papers and TV stations, maintained roving reporters, many of whom were stationed abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This structure ensured multiple layers of scrutiny: reporters in the field, copy editors, and editors stationed abroad, all fact-checking stories before publication or broadcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

The [[changes_in_media_structure_and_foreign_reporting | changes in media structure and foreign reporting]] began in the 1980s with the introduction of the fax machine, which reduced the need for extensive staffing abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Copy editors also became less common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. By the 1990s, email and attachments further decreased staffing numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The 2000s saw the disappearance of most foreign bureaus, leaving only a few roving reporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

With the rise of the internet, cost-cutting led to the elimination of most roving reporters, replaced by local "stringers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. While these stringers provided local insights, their reports often lacked fact-checking and were subject to their own biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### Current Landscape: Algorithms and Opinion
Today, algorithms are increasingly used to write newspaper stories and scrape the web for information, with fact-checking largely diminished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This shift has created an environment where it is easy for politicians to dismiss information as "fake news" and for political movements to form around individual personalities rather than verifiable facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This decline in "factfulness" leads people to trust individuals over institutions or established information venues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Global Parallels in Information Consumption
The current "information desert" in the United States is not unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   In regions like the Middle East, characterized by single-party rule, populations often live in an information vacuum where the rumor mill effectively becomes the news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This makes it difficult to establish basic truths, as rumors spread rapidly via email and social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   Russia faces an even more severe situation, where the rumor mill is supplemented by a state monopoly on information, leading to widespread consumption of government propaganda through traditional media like radio and TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

In the U.S., media operates as a business driven by audience engagement, prioritizing what people want to hear over what is true or necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This has led to:
*   News channels like Fox and MSNBC primarily functioning as opinion programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   Outlets like Newsmax being 100% opinion-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   Twitter becoming "colorful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   Nightly News broadcasts containing two-thirds drug commercials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

The primary news sources vary by age group, highlighting the [[impact_of_misinformation_on_social_media | impact of misinformation on social media]]:
*   Individuals between 25 and 45 typically get news from Facebook, considered "the worst" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   Those under 25 often use TikTok, which, while problematic, is deemed "better than Facebook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   The [[role_of_algorithms_and_fake_news | role of algorithms and fake news]] has further compounded these challenges.

## Recommendations for Credible News Sources
Finding reliable news requires intentional effort and consideration of source biases. A [[comparison_of_global_media_sources | comparison of global media sources]] reveals diverse levels of credibility.

### International Sources
*   **Al Jazeera:** Currently considered the most reliable international news source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. It aims to interview multiple people with multiple viewpoints, a practice akin to traditional journalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. However, it is heavily biased concerning Middle Eastern affairs, which should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **France 24:** Ranks second, notable for being one of the few entities still maintaining global bureaus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **BBC:** Has significantly declined in credibility over the last two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Canadian Broadcasting:** Considered "bottom of the barrel," being 100% opinion and party line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Local News Sources Globally:** While biased, they offer perspectives not found elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

### United States Sources
For national news in the U.S., three entities are suggested:
*   **The Wall Street Journal:** Focuses primarily on financial news but excels in its area of coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Bloomberg:** While not as strong as it once was, it provides a broad and even-handed coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Straight Arrow News:** A newer project that aims to provide non-partisan views on various topics by bringing together contributors from across the political spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

Armenia and Azerbaijan, two of the fifteen post-Soviet republics, have a long [[history_of_conflict_between_armenia_and_azerbaijan | history of conflict]] [00:00:08]. Their animosity predates the collapse of the Soviet Union, with a war breaking out between them even before its dissolution [00:00:15]. The geographic intermingling of their core population centers makes it difficult for either nation to feel secure without the other's cooperation [00:00:47].

## Historical Context of Conflict and Alliances

In the 1990s, Armenia, with backing and security guarantees from Russia, launched assaults on Azerbaijani positions, leading to Azerbaijan losing control of over a fifth of its territory, much of which remains occupied by Armenia today [00:00:57]. Azerbaijani troops were described as "incompetent" at the time [00:01:11].

A significant shift occurred approximately two years ago when Azerbaijan acquired Turkish combat drones [00:01:27]. In a swift conflict lasting less than a month, these drones decisively destroyed Armenian forces [00:01:34]. This marked one of the first times drones were used as a regular component of military policy [00:01:45]. Although Azerbaijani ground troops remained broadly incompetent, their improved training over the past year would allow them to advance further if a similar drone-led assault were to occur [00:02:07].

## Shifting Geopolitical Landscape

The current geopolitical situation necessitates Armenia seeking new security guarantors [00:03:41]. This is largely due to Russia, Armenia's traditional security guarantor, being heavily engaged in Ukraine [00:02:42]. Russia has been steadily pulling troops from other operations globally, including forces from the Caucasus, leading to uncertainty regarding the capacity of Russian forces in Armenia to fight or even if their equipment remains [00:02:54]. Furthermore, Russian forces lack a direct land connection to Armenia, requiring passage through Georgia or Azerbaijan, both of whom might now oppose such transit [00:03:30]. This situation creates a [[potential_geopolitical_shifts | geopolitical shift]] in the region.

## Potential Allies for Armenia

Given Russia's reduced capacity, Armenia's options for new alliances are limited:

*   **United States**: An alliance with the U.S. would be a significant undertaking and would likely require Armenia to return all land conquered during the 1990s [[history_of_conflict_between_armenia_and_azerbaijan | war]] [00:03:51]. This is a challenge, as Azerbaijan already maintains good relations with the U.S. [00:03:54].
*   **Turkey**: Turkey is a close ally of Azerbaijan, making it an unsuitable security guarantor for Armenia [00:04:09].
*   **Iran**: Despite Armenia being Christian and Iran being Muslim, the two nations have been de facto allies for most of the post-Soviet period [00:04:15]. Iran and Russia generally view Turkey and the United States as problems [00:04:29]. Iran also has concerns about an independent Azerbaijan due to the significant Azerbaijani ethnic minority within Iran [00:04:38].

## Influence of Domestic Politics

The powerful [[influence_of_armenian_lobbying_in_us_politics | Armenian Lobby in the United States]] has deeply integrated itself into the U.S. State Department and Hollywood [00:04:54]. This lobby has historically ensured that Armenia receives a substantial portion of the USAID budget, even during the 1990s when Armenians were the aggressors [00:05:09].

As Armenia explores new [[potential_alliances_and_partnerships_in_the_middle_east | potential alliances]], particularly with Iran, the entrenched [[influence_of_armenian_lobbying_in_us_politics | Armenian Lobby]] in the U.S. is expected to clash with the established anti-Iranian lobby [00:05:30]. This will create a "delightfully lively" dynamic in U.S. politics where domestic and foreign policy interests converge [00:06:25].

## Future Conflicts Over Corridors

Azerbaijan is expected to continue its efforts to secure key access points in the mountainous terrain, specifically targeting corridors vital for transport and economics [00:05:51]. There are ongoing disputes over several such corridors between Armenia and Azerbaijan [00:06:03]. If Azerbaijan succeeds in cutting the only significant connection between Armenia and Iran, it would inevitably trigger a response from Tehran [00:06:09]. While a general assault by Azerbaijan is unlikely, cutting a single corridor and stationing troops there to elicit a response from Turkey and the U.S. is a plausible scenario [00:06:33].

Nigeria is a country whose existence was shaped by the [[post_american_strategic_order_and_nigeria | post American strategic order]] following World War II, adopting elements from the Westphalian system of nation-states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Nigeria's Political Structure and Internal Dynamics

Nigeria is a [[Nigerias ethnic diversity and political structure | polygot group]] with numerous distinct [[Nigerias ethnic diversity and political structure | ethnic groups]], each with its own homeland, that have been combined under a single political authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. While similar colonial formations often lead to civil wars, Nigeria is no exception, having experienced the Biafran War shortly after independence in the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This conflict was one of the most disastrous on the African continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

However, after the war, Nigeria moved towards democracy, with the victors including the Biafrans in a transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The presidency rotates among various [[Nigerias ethnic diversity and political structure | ethnic groups]] and regions, with internal competition within the ruling party determining candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This system, though not fully democratic by Western standards, has maintained peace and kept Nigeria unified, unlike many other post-colonial nations like Congo or Angola <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### The Role of Oil in Maintaining Stability
A key aspect of this political strategy is the use of oil revenues to manage ethnic tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Nigeria is Africa's largest [[Nigerias oil industry and economic challenges | oil producer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. If civil unrest could be contained and competence improved, Nigeria could potentially produce 5-6 million barrels of oil per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. However, for the past 20-30 years, production has remained below 3 million barrels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

Oil funds are directed by the president, who takes a cut and uses the remainder to pacify other minorities, preventing protests or conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This system, however, inadvertently incentivizes militant groups to cause chaos to secure better financial settlements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

Under the [[Globalization and impact on Nigerian oil output | globalized order]], this system has been economically suboptimal, as vested interests attack oil infrastructure to gain a share of the revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. As a result, Nigeria's [[Nigerias oil industry and economic challenges | oil patrimony]] has been significantly smaller than its potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This environment, characterized by ethnic militant groups, has led to a loss of interest from international oil companies, which have experienced kidnappings and attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Most Western [[Nigerias oil industry and economic challenges | oil companies]] have exited, with Royal Dutch Shell in the process of leaving as of February 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Shifting Global Dynamics and Nigeria's Future Role

The world is transitioning away from a system where [[Impact of conflict on global oil prices | civilian Maritime shipping]] is secure, towards one with increased piracy and attacks on ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This shift necessitates a re-evaluation of Nigeria's role in the [[Global and regional economic consequences of an oil disruption | global Energy System]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Currently, Nigeria's self-imposed limitations on [[Nigerias oil industry and economic challenges | oil output]] (similar to Venezuela) make it a "non-factor" in global oil market management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

However, if global stability deteriorates, oil transportation will become more localized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Regions like the [[Middle East geopolitics and oil reliance | Persian Gulf]], home to major producers like Saudi Arabia and Iran, are expected to see significant reductions in output due to increased militancy and potential imperial activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### Nigeria's Geopolitical Strengths
Nigeria's location on the western side of the African continent provides a distinct advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. While it has territorial disputes, it does not face an outright war with its neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Countries to its northwest, north, and east are either in the Sahara (with limited military capacity) or the Sahel, where Nigeria has the densest population concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

Nigeria possesses a significant military, roughly three times the size of all French forces combined in the Sahel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Nigeria is the undisputed regional superpower from the Sahel to the tropics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This regional dominance means that in a fragmented global order, Nigeria's [[Nigerias oil industry and economic challenges | oil production]] could become far more critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### Potential Partnerships and Regional Influence
In a world where oil from the Persian Gulf and Russia becomes less accessible, secondary [[Nigerias oil industry and economic challenges | oil producers]] in the Eastern Hemisphere, particularly Nigeria, will gain renewed attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Nigeria lacks a physical border that would expose it to significant interstate war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, and much of the regional piracy originates internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

European powers like the UK and France are likely to seek partnerships in the Gulf of Guinea to secure crude supplies that are no longer available from traditional sources like the North Sea or Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Nigeria is the primary region for potential new oil development (Greenfield or Brownfield) in the area, unlike Algeria, whose fields are largely tapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This could lead to a reversal of the trend of Western oil majors exiting Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

Nigeria is the security decider in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Its level of industrialization and military firepower means that future relationships will not be neo-colonial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Instead, they will be partnerships: France and Britain provide technology and markets, while Nigeria provides the asset (oil) and the security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This collaborative model, though potentially messy, is expected to be productive, shaping regional geopolitics much like a century and a half ago, but with Nigeria as a significant player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

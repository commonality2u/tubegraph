Major auto manufacturers are scaling back their plans for electric vehicle (EV) production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Ford and GM have canceled plans for new battery and EV assembly facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, while Tesla has indicated a significant drawdown in global production capacity and may suspend or cancel plans for a gigafactory in Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This shift is attributed to multiple underlying issues.

## Environmental Concerns
From an [[environmental_impact_of_electric_vehicles | environmental point of view]], most EVs are "at best questionable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Claims of their environmental success often assume manufacturing with a clean energy mix and recharging with 100% green energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, which "happens exactly nowhere in the United States" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Even California, the "cleanest state," is still 50% fossil fuel energy, and they exclude imported power, much of which is 100% fossil fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

More significantly, the fabrication of EVs involves "so many more exotic materials" and is "so much more energy intensive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This work is primarily done in China, often using soft coal or lignite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This results in "an order of magnitude more carbon generated just to make these things in the first place" compared to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Consequently, EVs may not break even on carbon emissions for "approaching 10 years or more," even if "you buy the Chinese data" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Material Scarcity and Production Timelines
EVs require "an order of magnitude more stuff" like [[material_requirements_for_ev_manufacturing | copper]], [[material_requirements_for_ev_manufacturing | lithium]], and [[material_requirements_for_ev_manufacturing | graphite]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. If the world's vehicle fleet were to convert to EVs, "there's just not enough of this stuff on the planet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. The time required to scale up production of these [[material_requirements_for_ev_manufacturing | materials]] is "measured in decades" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Humanity has never doubled the production of any industrial [[material_requirements_for_ev_manufacturing | material]] within a 10-year period if it was already in use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The demand for materials like [[material_requirements_for_ev_manufacturing | nickel]] is estimated to increase tenfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, indicating significant [[challenges_in_mining_and_production_timelines | challenges in mining and production timelines]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Cost and Economic Factors
[[cost_and_economic_factors_in_the_ev_market | The cost]] of EVs is a major barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The cheapest EVs still cost about $10,000 more than their ICE equivalents, while more expensive models can be upwards of $70,000 higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This makes EVs unattainable for most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Infrastructure Challenges
A significant hurdle for widespread EV adoption is the lack of adequate infrastructure. "Range anxiety" is a real concern due to insufficient [[issues_with_ev_infrastructure_and_market_demand | charging stations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. To support a nationwide EV program, the United States needs to increase its electricity generation and throughput by about half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This level of expansion is unprecedented, as the US has only increased electricity generation by more than 3% in one year since the 1960s (a rebound year from COVID) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Achieving the necessary buildup would require "20 times more equipment" like transformers and cables than has been produced in the last 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Even if facilities to produce this equipment began construction today, they would not be ready at scale for four years, and the subsequent buildout would take another decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## Market Demand and Consumer Reluctance
Ultimately, [[issues_with_ev_infrastructure_and_market_demand | sales are down]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a> because people are simply not interested in EVs at present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Reasons for this include:
*   **Reliability:** EVs are perceived as less reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Range:** They often "don't have the range" consumers desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Technology Concerns:** People are "a little nervous about the technology in general" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   **Rapid Obsolescence:** Consumers are reluctant to pay current prices for potentially outdated EV technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

As a result, EVs are "building up on the Lots" while ICE vehicle lots are empty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Consumers are not buying them without "absolutely massive discounts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. These discounts have rendered the entire industry unprofitable, even with subsidies from the Inflation Reduction Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

The US has only converted 1% of its vehicle fleet to EVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, and it appears to be "very close to the peak" of adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. With limited capital, resources, material inputs, and labor, it's suggested that focus should shift to "technologies of the green transition that work," implying that EVs are not one of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

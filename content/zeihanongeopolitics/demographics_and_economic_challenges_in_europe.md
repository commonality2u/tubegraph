Europe faces significant [[demographic_and_economic_challenges_in_europe | demographic and economic challenges]] that are impacting its industrial capacity and future viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Energy Consumption and Economic Structure
Europe, broadly defined to include the Balkans, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the European Union, consumes approximately 13 million barrels of crude oil per day (including refined products) and about 45 billion cubic feet of natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This represents roughly 50% to 60% of the United States' energy usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

Despite having a larger population than the United States, Europe's economy is smaller and less energy-intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. While the U.S. has experienced a period of reindustrialization, much of Europe is undergoing de-industrialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Drivers of De-industrialization
The de-industrialization trend in Europe is attributed to multiple factors:
*   **Energy Shortages** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>
*   **Workforce Shortages** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>
*   **Finance Issues** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>

These issues are largely intertwined with the region's [[demographic_shifts_and_economic_implications | demographic story]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## The European "Demographic Bomb"
Europe is described as a region experiencing a "[[european_demographic_trends_and_economic_implications | demographic bomb]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This demographic decline poses significant challenges:
*   **[[demographic_challenges_facing_germany | Germany]]**: Its industrial base is projected to collapse within a decade due to a shrinking workforce, compounding its energy problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   **Euro Zone Stability**: The Euro Zone faces problems because maintaining a consumption-led economy is difficult without a growing population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Italy**: Despite a worse [[european_demographic_trends_and_economic_impacts | demographic situation]] than [[demographic_challenges_facing_germany | Germany]], Italy's geography is more favorable for power projection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## Future Alliances and Individual Country Viability
In a de-globalizing world, the United States will need to make strategic choices regarding its allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. While a broad alliance with Europe is culturally significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, the [[european_demographic_trends_and_economic_impacts | demographic challenges]] suggest that pouring all energy resources into the continent might not yield the "biggest bang for the buck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

Instead, the U.S. may opt to work with individual European countries, some of which appear more viable:
*   **France** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>
*   **The United Kingdom** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>
*   **Spain** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>
*   **Central Europe** (expected to last longer than [[demographic_challenges_facing_germany | Germany]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>

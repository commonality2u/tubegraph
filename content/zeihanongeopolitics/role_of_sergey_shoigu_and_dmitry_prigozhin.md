The current state of the Russian military operation in Ukraine is heavily influenced by the alleged incompetence and actions of key figures, particularly Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu and [[Wagner Group and its role in Russian military operations | Wagner Group]] head Dimitri Progason (Prigozhin).

## Sergey Shoigu: Defense Minister and Alleged Corruption
Sergey Shoigu, Russia's Defense Minister, is considered by some to be the most incompetent person in the Russian government currently, overseeing the broader battle plan and the entire defense industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. It is believed that Shoigu has personally stolen one-third of the Russian defense budget allocated for equipment manufacturing over several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. An additional one-third of that budget was reportedly stolen by his subordinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. This alleged corruption is cited as a reason for the [[russian_military_incompetence | Russian military incompetence]] and the lack of sufficient equipment for meaningful operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. He was also responsible for indicating that there would be significantly more weapons shipments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

## Dimitri Progason (Prigozhin): Head of the Wagner Group
Dimitri Progason, the head of the [[Wagner Group and its role in Russian military operations | Wagner Group]], is seen as a rival to Shoigu in terms of [[russian_military_incompetence | military incompetence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. Prior to a few years ago, Progason was a caterer who then received funds from the Russian government to establish the [[Wagner Group and its role in Russian military operations | Wagner Group]]â€”a parallel military organization that operates as mercenaries globally, committing war crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

Despite running a paramilitary organization, Progason has no experience managing, leading, or participating in a military operation himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. He has been leading the military operation in Bakhmut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. In the six months leading up to this assessment, the Russians have extensively committed forces to Bakhmut, resulting in the conservative estimate of 20,000 Russian deaths and 100,000 injured in this single battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. This significant loss of forces in a non-strategically significant battle has severely impacted [[russian_military_reserves and activation | Russian military reserves and activation]] and mobilization programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

## Impact on Russian Military Strength
The actions and alleged incompetence of Shoigu and Progason contribute to the overall state of the Russian military. The best estimates suggest that Russia has lost at least 100,000, and potentially up to 200,000, men since the start of the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Additionally, at least 100,000 were injured in Bakhmut alone, with another 100,000 injured elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

When the conflict began in February 2022, Russia had approximately 100,000 to 140,000 men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. A subsequent partial mobilization added another 300,000 troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. However, the combined losses (injured and dead) effectively negate the entire previous mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. This suggests that while a second partial mobilization might add 200,000 to 250,000 troops, the overall increase in effective fighting force is minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. Furthermore, these new recruits are less skilled and have primarily been involved in building anti-tank fortifications rather than direct combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. This points to potential [[russian_military_incompetence | Russian military incompetence]] and challenges for future operations.

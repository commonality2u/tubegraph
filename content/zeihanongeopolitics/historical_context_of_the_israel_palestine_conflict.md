The current situation is primarily described as a [[israel_and_hamas_conflict_overview | Hamas-Israel fight]], with expectations that no other major players will become directly involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Israeli Policy on Palestinian Displacement

Since at least 1973, and arguably since 1948, [[impact_of_israel_and_south_koreas_involvement | Israelis]] have sought to move Palestinians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. There have been hopes among [[political_dynamics_in_israel | Israelis]] to convince international bodies like the United States or the United Nations that a solution to the conflict involves moving all Gazans out of the Gaza Strip and into temporary camps in the Sinai region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. However, this proposal has faced strong rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Egypt's Role and Stance on Gaza

Egypt has been a significant historical and current actor regarding Gaza. Egyptians previously controlled Gaza between 1948 and 1973, a period described as difficult for all involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

Currently, Egypt has voiced the most vehement objection to the idea of moving Gazans into Sinai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Broadly, Egyptians are even against sending humanitarian aid into Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The prevailing sentiment in Egypt is that they would prefer Palestinians crossing into Egyptian territory only "in coffins or preferably by trucks full of bodies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, indicating a lack of willingness to offer assistance or refuge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

Recent events in Sinaloa state, northern Mexico, indicate that the [[Cartel violence and structure in Mexico | Sinaloa Cartel]] is devolving into a civil war, with at least 100 murders and numerous abductions reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Business Model and [[El Chapos leadership and capture | El Chapo's Leadership]]

The [[Cartel violence and structure in Mexico | Sinaloa Cartel]] has been unique among organized crime groups because it was run as a business, not just for power or money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Under the leadership of [[El Chapos leadership and capture | El Chapo]] (Joaquín Guzmán Loera), chapter leads would compare best practices to efficiently run drugs to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. [[El Chapos leadership and capture | El Chapo]] aimed for minimal disruption to local law enforcement and populations, emphasizing good relations with operating communities to prevent them from turning against the cartel or involving governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This approach allowed the [[Cartel violence and structure in Mexico | Sinaloa Cartel]] to become the largest organized crime group in Mexico by a significant margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Impact of Leadership Change

The cartel's success led the United States to designate [[El Chapos leadership and capture | El Chapo]] Public Enemy Number One <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. He was eventually captured and extradited, now serving multiple life sentences in the American prison system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. His incarceration left the organization in less competent hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. While [[El Chapos leadership and capture | El Chapo]] was a "murderous thug," he possessed strong managerial skills and a business acumen that helped him effectively manage his underlings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

Since his departure, the various factions he once controlled have begun to splinter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The situation escalated in July when Ismael Zambada, also known as El Mayo, who had taken over most operations, was arrested in Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. It appears that one of [[El Chapos leadership and capture | El Chapo's]] sons betrayed El Mayo, leading to his capture by American law enforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Now, "Los Chapitos" (El Chapo's sons), who control various factions, are fighting among themselves over their father's share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Decentralized Structure and Looming Violence

Cartels, especially in Mexico with its challenging internal transport, are not monolithic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. They consist of dozens of mostly locally defined groups, sometimes using different names and organizational structures, that only give lip service to the central leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. A strong, diplomatic ruler like [[El Chapos leadership and capture | El Chapo]] was essential to hold such a decentralized system together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. However, with [[El Chapos leadership and capture | El Chapo]] imprisoned, his deputy also in prison, and his children fighting, the structure is failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

The breakdown is most visible at the heart of the [[Cartel violence and structure in Mexico | Sinaloa Cartel]] organization in Sinaloa state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This violence is expected to expand beyond Sinaloa into the rest of Mexico, as local chapters increasingly assert their independence, leading to violent attempts by central factions to maintain control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### [[Influence of Sinaloa Cartel in the United States | Cross-Border Implications]]

[[El Chapos leadership and capture | El Chapo's]] business approach made the [[Cartel violence and structure in Mexico | Sinaloa Cartel]] the largest organized crime group globally, including its significant [[Influence of Sinaloa Cartel in the United States | presence in the United States]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. With the top leadership now in conflict, similar violence is anticipated north of the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Local distribution and retail operations of the cartel in the U.S., often local gangs, are expected to go their own way and resist control from the feuding Sinaloa factions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This internal conflict will likely result in higher drug prices due to distribution interruptions and increased violence at regional and local levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

The world is entering a period of increased [[Political Volatility and Realignment in the United States | political volatility]] due to significant shifts in both global economics and American internal politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This environment is likely to generate substantial stresses, leading to potential violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## American Political Realignment
The United States is currently experiencing a political rearrangement that occurs once every generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This shift is characterized by the evolution of political factions within the American "first past the post" system, where voters elect individuals representing specific geographies rather than parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

American parties are typically weak coalitions of various political factions that band together to secure electoral victories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. However, the evolution of technology, demographics, and economic patterns is causing these traditional factions to lose coherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

For instance, within the Republican coalition, the business, national security, and fiscal communities have largely been ejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Conversely, figures like Donald Trump have successfully attracted new groups, such as Union voters and Hispanics, away from the Democratic coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This ongoing realignment is influenced by the rise and fall of hyper-globalization and the demographic shift of Baby Boomers moving out of the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Global Economic Collapse and Reform
The post-World War II global economic consensus, where the United States provided security and open markets in exchange for Cold War alignment, is breaking down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This system facilitated the rise of various economies, including China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

Two primary reasons contribute to this breakdown:
1.  **Shifting US Capabilities and Willingness**: The United States can no longer afford or is unwilling to maintain its global security role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The US Navy has transitioned from a global patrol force to a smaller number of clusters optimized for warfighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Politically, Americans are increasingly unwilling to bear the economic costs of keeping global markets open, perceiving it as disadvantaging American workers in the current populist era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
2.  **Global Demographic Decline**: Seven decades of industrialization and urbanization have led to declining birth rates worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The 2020s are marked as the decade when many countries will lose the workforce capacity necessary to support the existing globalized system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, as consumption is essential for trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

This means that while the American political system is evolving, the global economic network is collapsing and reforming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## Consequences: Increased Conflict and Violence
These fundamental changes in political and economic structures create widespread uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. When established systems change, those with vested interests may fail, leading to fear and anger among populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

This environment is expected to result in:
*   **State-level military conflicts**: The first of these is already evident in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, with the potential for [[potential_conflict_scenarios_between_china_and_the_united_states | conflict involving China]] in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. These are examples of [[regional_military_conflicts_and_global_impacts | regional military conflicts]].
*   **Domestic political violence**: In the United States, periods of significant political change historically coincide with domestic political violence, as seen during the Great Depression, Reconstruction, and the Civil War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. The recent assassination attempt on Donald Trump is an example of such rising domestic political violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

While these shifts may ultimately lead to a net gain for the United States, the transitional process from a comfortable, known past to an uncertain future will inevitably generate considerable stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

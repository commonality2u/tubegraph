The United States is anticipated to cease its role in patrolling global oceans, a shift expected to significantly alter the international economic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Historical Context of US Global Role

Following World War II, the United States established a new global network primarily to confront the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. With much of Western Europe devastated, the threat of a Soviet takeover was a significant concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. To encourage other nations to align against the Soviets, the US offered an inducement: global trade and globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The US Navy began patrolling global oceans to ensure free trade for all, and the American market, the only one of size to survive the war intact, was opened to global exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. At that time, the US consumer market was roughly as large as the rest of the world combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This initiative laid the foundation for the current global economic system, which has a GDP of approximately $90 to $100 trillion, with one-quarter to one-third based on international exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This system would not have been possible without the US Navy's patrols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, which remains at least seven times more powerful than all other navies combined, excluding close allies like the British and Japanese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

The United States did not undertake this global role for its own benefit, as it possesses a continental economic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, only beginning significant economic integration with Mexico and Canada after 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The primary beneficiaries of this system have been Germany, which faces economic challenges due to demographic trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, and China, which aspires to be the next global superpower but without a global navy, a consumption-led system, or strong alliances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Diminishing US Global Security Role

For over a decade, the US has been incrementally disengaging from its role in maintaining this global system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This is leading to [[shifts_in_us_foreign_policy_and_its_implications | incremental shifts in foreign policy]], making the US less inclined to protect entities like oil tankers or shipments from the Russian space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Countries that have benefited from American protection without contributing to security are now facing increased scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. As allies face demographic declines, the economic rationale for globalization is weakening, and the security argument has largely vanished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Case Study: The Persian Gulf

The Persian Gulf serves as a prime example of this disengagement due to its critical importance for maritime shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Historically, the US has sourced most of its energy from the Western Hemisphere and is now net independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Most of the crude oil from the Persian Gulf has traditionally gone to the US alliance network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, but more recently, particularly since the conflict with Russia, it has primarily gone to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This shift further weakens the strategic case for the US to maintain open sea lanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

This change in policy is evident in recent events:
*   The Iranian confiscation or hijacking of oil tankers has gone unaddressed by the US Navy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   While the US is now deploying Marine Expeditionary Units (MEU) to the Persian Gulf, an MEU (a carrier with 2,000 Marines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a> represents only about one-sixth the firepower of a Nimitz supercarrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Until 10-15 years ago, the US consistently maintained one or two supercarriers in the Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. For years, there has been no meaningful US presence, and when issues arise, an MEU is sent to reassure allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, a small force compared to previous reflexive deployments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## Future Implications for Global Trade

The most probable trigger for a breakdown in the current system involves Russia, as its operations in Ukraine are becoming more violent, targeting agricultural systems to cause famine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Russia is also shipping grain confiscated from captured Ukrainian territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. It is likely that the US will soon explicitly or implicitly withdraw protection from Russian maritime shipments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. When something happens to one of these ships, such as piracy or state seizure, global insurance rates will dramatically change as the US Navy's role in providing global security diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

Even minor disruptions can break supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Most manufacturing, particularly for items below the complexity of cell phones and computers, operates on margins of less than three percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. These production processes often involve at least a dozen countries across the Asian rim and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Interruption at any step with such low margins can cause the entire product chain to collapse, especially in the era of containerized shipping where thousands of containers hold hundreds of thousands of components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Even minor disruption could lead to the entire economic model of East Asia breaking down rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Companies with extended supply chains may need to make plans for closure, as there may not be enough time to build new systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, and labor in North America is largely already allocated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

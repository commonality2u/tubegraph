In a "post-American" world where the [[shifts_in_us_foreign_policy_and_its_implications | United States]] becomes less globally interested, [[Canadas relationship with the United States | Canada]] faces significant changes in its relationship with its southern neighbor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Historically, [[Canadas relationship with the United States | Canada]] has been able to extract concessions from Washington due to its small population and perceived lack of threat to the American mainland since the War of 1812 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## Historical Context

Throughout the Cold War and into the post-Cold War period, [[Canadas relationship with the United States | Canada]] leveraged the [[shifts_in_us_foreign_policy_and_its_implications | United States]]' preoccupation with global crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. For instance, when the [[shifts_in_us_foreign_policy_and_its_implications | U.S.]] was embroiled in events like the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Berlin Wall fiasco, or conflicts in Iraq, [[Canadas relationship with the United States | Canada]] could offer assistance in exchange for trade concessions, such as on auto parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. This strategy worked because [[Canadas relationship with the United States | Canada]] was not a high priority on the American "watch list" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Shift in Post-9/11 and Trump Eras

The dynamic began to change in the post-9/11 era, particularly under the Trump administration and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The [[shifts_in_us_foreign_policy_and_its_implications | United States]] started equating trade issues with national security more directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. As the [[shifts_in_us_foreign_policy_and_its_implications | U.S.]] withdraws from maintaining global order, it has fewer large-scale international concerns that divert its attention, such as the Berlin Airlift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Consequently, [[Canadas relationship with the United States | Canada]] has moved from being approximately the 23rd priority to the third or fourth on the American agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

This increased focus means [[Canadas relationship with the United States | Canada]] has lost its "wiggle room" in negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. The relationship with the [[shifts_in_us_foreign_policy_and_its_implications | United States]] is becoming "harsher, more direct, and more bare-knuckled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## Increased American Scrutiny and Leverage

A [[shifts_in_us_foreign_policy_and_its_implications | United States]] primarily concerned with North America must direct more attention toward [[Canadas relationship with the United States | Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This scrutiny highlights that [[Canadas relationship with the United States | Canada]], due to its confederacy structure where provinces often set different trade policies, is perceived by the [[shifts_in_us_foreign_policy_and_its_implications | United States]] as one of the most protectionist countries it deals with regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. The [[shifts_in_us_foreign_policy_and_its_implications | U.S.]] is now paying closer attention to this and possesses significantly more leverage in the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

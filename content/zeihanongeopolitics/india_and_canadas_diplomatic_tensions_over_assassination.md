Diplomatic tensions flared between India and Canada following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's accusation that the Indian government was involved in an assassination plot on Canadian soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. The victim was a Sikh immigrant who held Canadian citizenship and had renounced his Indian citizenship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. He was disliked by India for supporting separatist groups, an issue India largely considers resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>.

## Confirmation of the Accusation

Intelligence indicates that the accusation appears to be true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>. The intelligence did not originate from Canada but from the United States, shared through the Five Eyes system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:24">[01:08:24]</a>. The [[Canadas_relationship_with_the_United_States | United States]] possesses superior intelligence capabilities in Canada compared to the Canadian government itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:30">[01:30:30]</a>. This intelligence was further verified by the British government, which has better information-gathering capabilities in India than Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:26">[01:36:26]</a>. Essentially, all Five Eyes members quietly affirmed Canada's position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:07">[01:45:07]</a>.

## India's Evolving Capabilities and Global Implications

This incident marks a significant development, as the Indian government has never previously been observed carrying out assassinations beyond its immediate borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:08">[01:52:08]</a>. This represents a fundamentally new operational capacity for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:14">[01:58:14]</a>.

Assassinations are becoming more prevalent in global statecraft, with Russia notably increasing its pace even before the Ukraine war, employing methods like radiation and poisoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:02">[02:04:02]</a>. The U.S. also engages in targeted killings, typically via drone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:06">[02:27:06]</a>, and the British are known for their capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:13">[02:39:13]</a>.

However, India's involvement in an extraterritorial assassination carries substantial [[global_implications_of_indian_governments_actions_abroad | global implications of the Indian government's actions abroad]] due to its arguably largest diaspora worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:06">[02:44:06]</a>. If India begins to patrol its diaspora using extra-territorial and extra-legal means, it could provoke negative reactions globally and potentially lead to the assassination of individuals important to other governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:06">[02:50:06]</a>.

### Impact on the Indian Diaspora in Canada

Canada is a major destination for Indian students and its [[impact_of_assassination_on_indian_diaspora_in_canada | Indian diaspora]] is the fastest-growing ethnic group in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:47">[03:12:47]</a>. Individuals who emigrate are typically not fervent patriots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:15">[03:22:15]</a>. This incident is expected to incite more agitation within Canada rather than quieting dissent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:21">[03:29:21]</a>. As a free country with a relatively free press, Canada allows for widespread public discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:04">[03:41:04]</a>. The global dissemination of information will likely generate significant publicity even within India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:04">[03:57:04]</a>, making the assassination an unwise move if the goal was to suppress discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:02">[04:03:02]</a>.

## Broader Diplomatic and Geopolitical Context

The Five Eyes' affirmation of Canada's statement raises questions about [[indias_international_relations_and_foreign_policy | India's international relations and foreign policy]], particularly with the UK, Australia, and the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:04">[04:10:04]</a>. The US and Australia are part of the Quad grouping with India, a security dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:49">[04:24:49]</a>. The UK maintains relations through the Commonwealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:16">[04:30:16]</a>. If India, a major power, engages in actions considered "unsavory" by democratic norms, it will undoubtedly impact these relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:02">[04:41:02]</a>.

### [[great_power_politics_involving_india_and_western_relations | Great Power Politics]]

In the realm of [[great_power_politics_involving_india_and_western_relations | great power politics]], when a country identifies a significant threat, diplomatic niceties often give way to hard security concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:05">[05:07:05]</a>. This can lead to alliances with nations or personalities that would normally be unthinkable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:01">[05:26:01]</a>. Historical examples include the US alliance with Stalin against Hitler, and later with Mao against Stalin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:04">[05:33:04]</a>.

The decision to partner with a "mostly democratic, a little bit unsavory India" to counter China, now seen as the "most totalitarian government in the world," is an easy one for Western nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:06">[05:56:06]</a>. This dynamic means the relationship between the US (and to a lesser extent, Britain and Australia) and India will shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:07">[06:09:07]</a>. These alliances are typically formed against a specific threat, and the relationship changes once that threat is neutralized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:09">[06:17:09]</a>.

India faces significant decisions in the coming years as actions against China intensify, regarding whether to pursue a more productive relationship with Western nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:10">[06:29:10]</a>. Historically, India has practiced non-alignment, unofficially siding with the Soviets during the Cold War but largely adhering to its non-alignment stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:09">[06:56:09]</a>. The current situation reflects a similar political ideology on a larger scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:06">[07:04:06]</a>.

Ultimately, India's policy decisions will be made in New Delhi, prioritizing "Indian things with Indian policy for Indian interests" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:04">[07:19:04]</a>. Despite potential disapproval from Western nations, India is expected to fare well in a world where many countries are aligning against China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:02">[07:28:02]</a>.

The [[postcold_war_global_economic_system | European security order]] established after World War II is undergoing a significant transformation, marked by [[germanys_evolving_role_in_european_security | Germany]]'s re-emergence as a military actor. A key development is [[germanys_evolving_role_in_european_security | Germany]]'s permanent military deployment of approximately 5,000 troops to Lithuania as part of its [[NATO Expansion and Baltic Sea Control | NATO]] commitments [00:00:08, 00:00:15, 00:00:20]. This deployment is not a United Nations mission or a rotating program [00:00:13].

## The Traditional Post-WWII Order

For 75 years, the international community has actively worked to prevent [[germanys_evolving_role_in_european_security | Germany]] from having a deployment-capable military [00:00:29, 00:00:32]. [[germanys_shift_towards_western_alliance | Germany]] has been integrated into the [[NATO and regional powers response to Russian influence | NATO]] system, with the United States largely underwriting German physical security [00:00:36, 00:00:38]. This has positioned [[germanys_evolving_role_in_european_security | Germany]] as a "security consumer" [00:00:42]. While this arrangement placed a financial strain on the United States and its allies [00:00:45], it ensured [[european_unions_changing_dynamics | Germany]] did not possess a functional military, which was considered crucial [00:00:54, 00:00:57].

Historically, [[germanys_evolving_role_in_european_security | Germany]]'s borders are largely indefensible, and it is surrounded by countries that, despite being allies now, have not always been so [00:01:02, 00:01:03, 00:01:05]. The United States, by forcibly rewriting the rules of [[european_unions_response to current geopolitical challenges | European security]], helped keep Europe united and at peace for 75 years, especially in the [[postcold_war_global_economic_system | post-Cold War era]] [00:01:12, 00:01:17, 00:01:21]. A core aspect of this order was [[germanys_evolving_role_in_european_security | Germany]]'s agreement to refrain from having an opinion on security matters [00:01:24, 00:01:26].

## Shifting Dynamics

The current military deployment to Lithuania signals that this agreement is "going by the wayside" [00:01:28, 00:01:30]. [[germanys_evolving_role_in_european_security | Germany]] is now developing military capabilities, indicating its rehabilitation as a more "normal country" with military tactics and strategies as part of its toolkit [00:01:32, 00:01:38, 00:01:46]. This shift means [[germanys_evolving_role_in_european_security | Germany]] will begin to form its own opinions on security issues [00:01:51]. In the short term, this is seen as broadly beneficial for the [[european_unions_response to current geopolitical challenges | European alliance]], particularly concerning shared concerns about [[nato_and_regional_powers_response to russian_influence | Russia]] and Ukraine [00:01:55, 00:01:58].

However, the historical context of [[germanys_evolving_role_in_european_security | Germany]]'s rearmament after periods of disarmament is a concern, as past instances led to rapid and significant conflicts [00:02:12, 00:02:16, 00:02:18, 00:02:20]. While [[germanys_evolving_role_in_european_security | Germany]] is not currently an adversary, its perspective on global affairs is expected to change [00:02:27, 00:02:29, 00:02:31].

## Impact on Regional Powers

The transformation of [[european_unions_response to current geopolitical challenges | European security]] has significant implications for other regional powers:

### Poland
[[emerging_regional_powers_in_europe | Poland]] is identified as a major "loser" from this change [00:02:37]. [[emerging_regional_powers_in_europe | Poland]] is undertaking a massive rearmament program designed to prevent falling under the control of [[germanys_evolving_role_in_european_security | Germany]] or [[nato_and_regional_powers_response to russian_influence | Russia]] again [00:02:41, 00:02:43, 00:02:45, 00:02:47]. This program was partly predicated on the assumption that [[germanys_evolving_role_in_european_security | Germany]] would not be a military threat [00:02:50, 00:02:51]. Now, [[emerging_regional_powers_in_europe | Poland]] must pay more attention to its western border [00:02:53, 00:02:54]. Despite the necessity of cooperation with the Polish government for the German deployment in Lithuania [00:02:58, 00:03:00], this development creates nervousness across the Polish political spectrum due to historical awareness [00:03:03, 00:03:06, 00:03:08, 00:03:09].

### Russia
[[nato_and_regional_powers_response to russian_influence | Russia]] is considered the "far bigger loser" [00:03:10, 00:03:13]. The Soviet and [[postcold_war_global_economic_system | post-Soviet Russian system]] benefited from American control over regional security, meaning countries like Sweden, Finland, [[germanys_evolving_role_in_european_security | Germany]], and France would not act independently as long as there was a working relationship with Washington [00:03:17, 00:03:19, 00:03:21, 00:03:23, 00:03:26, 00:03:27, 00:03:30, 00:03:31, 00:03:33]. This is no longer the case [00:03:36, 00:03:37]. The Ukraine war, while bringing the alliance closer, has compelled many regional powers to take matters into their own hands [00:03:38, 00:03:40, 00:03:42, 00:03:44]. While [[NATO and regional powers response to Russian influence | NATO]] allies are united in countering [[nato_and_regional_powers_response to russian_influence | Russia]], their actions are increasingly independent and not fully coordinated [00:03:47, 00:03:50, 00:03:52, 00:03:55, 00:03:57, 00:04:01].

The prospect of [[germanys_evolving_role_in_european_security | Germany]], Europe's largest economy, developing military capabilities and taking independent action is [[nato_and_regional_powers_response to russian_influence | Russia]]'s "worst nightmare" [00:04:05, 00:04:07, 00:04:09, 00:04:14]. Historically, [[germanys_evolving_role_in_european_security | Germany]] has been the country that has given [[nato_and_regional_powers_response to russian_influence | Russia]] its "biggest run for its money in the modern era" [00:04:18, 00:04:20, 00:04:21]. With [[germanys_evolving_role_in_european_security | Germany]] now possessing military hardware again, the landscape of [[european_unions_response to current geopolitical challenges | European security]] is fundamentally altered [00:04:23].

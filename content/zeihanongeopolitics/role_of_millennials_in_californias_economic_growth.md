California's economic success over the past four decades has been influenced by several factors, including the [[impact_of_immigration_and_population_trends_on_california | migration]] of Millennials to its urban centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Millennials as a Growth Catalyst
When Millennials came of age in the 2000s and 2010s, they sought an urban coastal experience, making cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco major beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This demographic shift saw Millennials moving from the middle of the country to the coast, contributing significantly to LA's prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

Despite a decline in internal [[impact_of_immigration_and_population_trends_on_california | population growth]], the consistent influx of people in their 20s and 30s significantly bolstered California's tax rates and labor force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Contribution to the Tech Sector
The presence of Millennials, combined with ample capital availability, was crucial for the emergence of the tech sector in California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The technology industry, which involves imagining and developing future innovations, requires a large workforce of young individuals. A substantial number of people in their 20s and 30s are needed for imagining, designing, prototyping, and operationalizing new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This process generates no immediate income, necessitating cheap capital to fund the work and pay these individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This environment, prevalent in California for the last 25 years, directly led to the growth of Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Shifting Trends and Millennial Out-migration
However, the [[demographic_shifts_and_economic_implications | trends]] that once benefited California are now reversing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Millennials are no longer in the age group seeking formative experiences in urban coastal areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. While they may have delayed traditional life milestones, they are now getting married, having children, and buying homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Many are choosing not to remain in California and are moving out to other states, such as Texas, seeking brighter economic horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This out-migration means Millennials are no longer a net benefit to California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

These [[impact_of_demographics_on_economic_future | demographic shifts]] are forcing California to redefine its economic model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

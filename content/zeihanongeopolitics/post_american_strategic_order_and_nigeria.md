Nigeria is a country whose very existence is a creation of the [[Shift in US global strategic role | post-World War II strategic order]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. It is a polyglot group with numerous distinct ethnic groups, each with its own homeland, but combined under a single political authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Internal Dynamics and Stability

Like many former colonies, Nigeria experienced significant internal conflict after independence, notably the Biafran War in the 1960s, which was one of the most disastrous wars on the African continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Unusually, after this war, the victors chose to include the Biafrans in a transition to democracy rather than seeking to wipe them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Nigeria maintains peace and unity through a unique system where the presidency rotates among various ethnic groups and regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Within each region, there is competition within the ruling party to select a candidate for the presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. While this system does not always generate the most creative or competent leadership, it has successfully maintained peace and kept Nigeria as a unified nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

The challenge of this strategy is that ethnic groups not holding the presidency must be compensated to prevent protests, riots, or war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This is where Nigeria's oil wealth comes into play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Oil Production and Challenges

Nigeria is Africa's largest oil producer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. With more competence and less civil unrest, it could potentially produce five to six million barrels per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. However, for the past 20 to 30 years, its output has consistently remained below three million barrels per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

The oil funds are directed by the president, who takes a personal cut, with the remainder used to appease minority groups and deter chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This system inadvertently encourages militant groups to cause chaos to secure better cash settlements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Under the current globalized order, this has led to a severely underdeveloped oil patrimony, operating at about one-third to one-quarter of its potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

This environment, characterized by ethnic-based militant groups attacking oil production sites and kidnapping personnel, has led Western oil companies to lose interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. For example, Royal Dutch Shell was in the process of withdrawing from Nigeria in early 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## Nigeria's Strategic Importance in a Shifting Global Order

As the world moves away from an era of safe civilian maritime shipping towards increased piracy and state-level attacks on ships, Nigeria's role in the global energy system requires re-evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. While Nigeria has historically been a non-factor in managing oil markets due to its self-imposed limitations, this is likely to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

If global stability deteriorates, oil transportation distances will shrink, and production in volatile regions like the Persian Gulf could fall by half, with countries like Iran's crude potentially going offline entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. In such a scenario, Nigeria, located on the western side of the African continent, presents a more stable option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Although it has territorial disputes with neighbors, it does not face an outright war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Regional Power and Future Partnerships

Nigeria is the undisputed superpower in its region, from the Sahel down to the tropics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Its military is approximately three times larger than all the French forces in the Sahel combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. While a conflict would be messy, Nigeria is capable of inflicting more damage than it receives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

In a world with reduced oil supplies from traditional sources like the Persian Gulf or Russia, secondary oil producers in the Eastern Hemisphere, particularly Nigeria, will gain significant importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Nigeria could become the largest or second-largest secondary oil producer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Much of the piracy in the region originates from within Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

This emerging environment will see countries like Britain and France actively seeking partnerships in the Gulf of Guinea, where Nigeria is situated, to secure crude oil that they can no longer obtain from the North Sea or Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Unlike Algeria, whose fields are very mature, Nigeria is one of the few places offering opportunities for both Greenfield and Brownfield oil development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

This shift is expected to reverse the trend of Western supermajors leaving Nigeria, as there will be limited alternative choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. While other tertiary energy producers like Angola, Gabon, and Equatorial Guinea may also receive renewed interest, Nigeria remains the key security arbiter in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

This new dynamic will not be a neocolonial relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. Nigeria is not unindustrialized, and the population and technological imbalances seen in previous colonial eras are not present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Instead, it will be a partnership where the French and British provide technology and markets, and the Nigerians offer the assets and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. This partnership is expected to be productive, though messy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

The [[Regional and global geopolitics involving Nigerian oil | geopolitics of the region]] will begin to resemble earlier eras, but with more money and Nigeria as a significant, independent player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

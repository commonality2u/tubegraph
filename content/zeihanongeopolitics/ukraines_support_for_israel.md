In the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attack on [[usisrael_relations | Israel]] on October 7, 2023, the [[ukraines_longerrange_drone_capabilities | Ukrainian]] government publicly offered its support to the [[usisrael_relations | Israeli]] government in defending against the assault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Context of Bilateral Relations

This offer of support by [[ukraines_longerrange_drone_capabilities | Ukraine]] is notable given the previous dynamic between the two nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The [[ukraines_longerrange_drone_capabilities | Ukrainian]] government had expressed annoyance with the [[usisrael_relations | Israelis]] for attempting to remain neutral in the face of the [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Russian]] invasion of [[ukraines_longerrange_drone_capabilities | Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

[[usisrael_relations | Israel]]'s previous stance of neutrality was influenced by its domestic demographics, as approximately one-sixth of its population is [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Russian]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Furthermore, [[usisrael_relations | Israel]] has historically sought to maintain open lines of communication with the [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Russians]] as a means to influence events in the Arab world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Potential Impact on [[usisrael_relations | Israeli]] Policy

The quick and public declaration of support from [[ukraines_longerrange_drone_capabilities | Ukraine]] may influence the mindset within [[usisrael_relations | Israel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. For [[usisrael_relations | Israel]], dealing with groups like Hamas is considered an existential issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

> There is no direct indication of [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Russian]] involvement in the Hamas attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. However, some tactics employed by Hamas are familiar, and senior Hamas leadership has had frequent contact with Moscow over the past year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

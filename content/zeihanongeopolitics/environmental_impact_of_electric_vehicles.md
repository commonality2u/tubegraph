While often promoted as an environmental solution, the actual environmental benefits of [[challenges_facing_ev_production_and_adoption|Electric Vehicles]] (EVs) are at best questionable, with data supporting them often relying on unrealistic assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Energy Mix for Operation
The assumption that EVs are a "slam dunk" success environmentally depends on them being built with a relatively clean energy mix and recharged with 100% green energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This ideal scenario does not occur anywhere in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

Even California, considered the cleanest state, still relies on 50% fossil fuel energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. California's statistics may be misleading as they do not account for the energy mix of power imported from other states, which constitutes about a third of their total demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. For instance, approximately 10 gigawatts a day (more than most small countries) comes from areas like Phoenix, Arizona, to the LA Basin, and this power is 100% fossil fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Manufacturing Impact
The fabrication process for EVs is significantly more energy-intensive than for internal combustion engines due to the requirement for more exotic materials and the energy needed to process them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

Most of this manufacturing work is performed in [[impact_of_chinas_industrial_policies_on_global_economies|China]], where energy is primarily sourced from soft coal or lignite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This results in an order of magnitude more carbon generated just to produce an EV compared to an internal combustion vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Consequently, EVs do not break even on their carbon footprint within a year; for most, it approaches 10 years or more, assuming Chinese data is accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## [[material_requirements_for_ev_manufacturing|Material Requirements for EV Manufacturing]]
EVs demand an order of magnitude more raw [[material_requirements_for_ev_manufacturing|materials]] than conventional vehicles, including copper, molybdenum, [[limitations_of_lithium_as a_battery_material|lithium]], and graphite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The energy content required to process these [[material_requirements_for_ev_manufacturing|materials]] contributes significantly to the overall energy [[cost_and_economic_factors_in_the_ev_market|cost]] of an EV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

A major concern is the global availability of these [[material_requirements_for_ev_manufacturing|materials]] if the world's vehicle fleets were to convert to EVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Humanity has never doubled the production of any industrial material within a 10-year period if it was already in use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The transition to EVs would require 10 times as much nickel, among other elements, suggesting that these [[material_requirements_for_ev_manufacturing|materials]] are simply not available in the quantities needed for rapid, widespread adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Achieving such a transition would likely take a century or more, rather than a short timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

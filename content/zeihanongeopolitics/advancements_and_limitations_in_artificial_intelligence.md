Artificial Intelligence (AI) is currently on the cusp of significant breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Programs like ChatGPT have rapidly advanced, demonstrating substantial progress in a short timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. AI-driven applications are now widely available for purchase across numerous industries, where they are making a considerable impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Hardware Limitations

Despite these advancements, a primary limitation for AI's continued growth is hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Not all chips are capable of the intensive processing required for AI; only the most advanced chips, specifically those four nanometers and smaller, possess the necessary capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### The Global Chip Ecosystem

The vast majority of these high-end chips are manufactured in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The true challenge lies not just with Taiwan's security situation but with the intricate global ecosystem supporting this manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This ecosystem involves approximately 9,000 companies that contribute to building the necessary components for chip production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

A critical vulnerability within this supply chain is that about half of the manufacturing steps are performed by only one company in one country, with a single staff and a sole customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This represents globalization in its most perfect form, a system that has taken 60 years to establish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Disrupting globalization in any significant region would cripple the mass production of these essential chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

Rebuilding such an ecosystem would be a decade-long process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This is further complicated by an environment experiencing a [[capital_availability_and_its_effects_on_technology_development | capital]] shortage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

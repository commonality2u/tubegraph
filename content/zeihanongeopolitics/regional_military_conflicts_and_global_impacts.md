In a world where the United States is less engaged in global affairs, especially regarding security and trade, countries are increasingly compelled to manage their own security and needs, leading to potential regional conflicts with global repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This era marks a significant shift in [[Global economic restructuring and its impacts | global economic restructuring]] and [[potential_geopolitical_shifts | geopolitical shifts]] as traditional alliances loosen and new regional powers emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

## The Shifting Landscape in the Middle East

The Middle East serves as a prime example of a region undergoing significant changes in its security architecture.

### Israel's Domestic and Strategic Challenges
Israel faces internal challenges that could impact its future power. A segment of its population, supported by the government to study the Torah, does not serve in the military or work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. This group is growing, potentially becoming nearly as populous as the rest of the country in 30 to 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. This demographic trend is already a significant burden on the country's tax base and manpower, suggesting that the Israel of the future may not be as powerful due to a reduced workforce for technology research, military manning, and other essential roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. Consequently, Israel must act with greater decisiveness as it cannot rely on population size or economic strength as it once did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

### The Retreat of US Influence
A key factor shaping regional dynamics is the United States' increasing disinterest in the world, particularly the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. This shift necessitates Israel to seek alternative security guarantors or adopt a more active role in its own defense without relying on US troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

### Emerging Regional Alliances and Security Partners
As the US scales back its [[US involvement in the Middle East and challenges in global security | involvement in the Middle East]], new regional alignments are forming:

*   **Turkey**: With Russia too distant and European powers like Britain and France facing their own challenges, Turkey emerges as a proximate naval and ground military power in the Eastern Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. Despite a past falling out over Gaza, cooperation between Israel and Turkey on military and intelligence matters has steadily increased over recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. Turkey is unequivocally the local military power that Israel must engage with given American disengagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
*   **Jordan and Egypt**: These countries have historically been compelled into cooperation with Israel through US financial aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. While this support may diminish, the current risk is more their internal instability rather than them posing a direct threat to Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.
*   **Saudi Arabia**: Israel has found a new partner in Saudi Arabia to counter threats from Iraq and Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. Saudi Arabia offers valuable intelligence on the Shia world, proximity for potential direct military strikes requiring basing, and nominal control over Sunni Islam due to its shrines in Mecca and Medina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. This warming relationship has led to a reduction in transnational attacks and diplomatic condemnations against Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. Formal recognition between the two is anticipated soon, likely following the succession of Muhammad bin Salman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.
    *   The alliance is robust, involving shared intelligence on Iran and collaboration in third countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.
    *   From Saudi Arabia's perspective, Israel is a more reliable partner than the US, especially as the US has prioritized human rights and the Yemen war over its Cold War-era interest in securing Persian Gulf oil flows to allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.
    *   Israel has begun to fill the void left by receding American military aid to Saudi Arabia, purchasing equipment from the US, adding its expertise, and transferring it to Riyadh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.

## Predicted Major Regional Conflicts

The current decade is anticipated to witness three significant regional military conflicts, with global impacts:

1.  **The Ukraine War**: This conflict has already commenced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.
2.  **The China Wars**: This refers to a conflict in the East Pacific where China either lashes out or becomes a target, potentially leading to its demise as a nation, assuming its demographics don't cause collapse first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>. This relates to the [[future_of_global_trade_and_regionalization_trends | future of global trade and regionalization trends]] and the [[impact_of_geopolitical_tensions_on_shipping_routes | impact of geopolitical tensions on shipping routes]].
3.  **The Persian Gulf Conflict**: This will be a struggle for dominance in the Persian Gulf, primarily between Iran and Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. Israel is expected to fully back Saudi Arabia, while Turkey's role remains a wild card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>. This conflict will have significant implications for [[regional_and_global_geopolitics_involving_nigerian_oil | regional and global geopolitics involving Nigerian oil]] and the [[global_and_regional_economic_consequences_of_an_oil_disruption | global and regional economic consequences of an oil disruption]].

Unlike the "China war," which might see a rapid collapse due to severed energy and food connections, countries in the Middle East possess the financial capacity and geographic insulation to sustain prolonged conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. Israel will play a critical role in determining Saudi Arabia's success in this Persian Gulf conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>. This period of heightened regional tension and dramatic events is expected to last for a considerable time in the post-American era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.

The American Southwest is experiencing a significant water problem, rooted in its arid terrain and reliance on fickle orographic precipitation. Historically, this region has seen periods of mass extinction and civilizational breakdown, sometimes leading to cannibalism, due to mega-droughts [00:00:17] [00:01:09]. The current period is identified as one such mega-drought [00:01:13].

## The Colorado River Compact and its Flaws

Recognizing limited water supplies, states in the American Southwest established the Colorado River Compact in 1922 to share water [00:01:20] [00:01:25]. However, the year used to evaluate available water was one of the wettest on record, meaning the volumes agreed upon in the treaty were unrealistic from the start [00:01:31] [00:01:34] [00:01:36].

A significant legal issue is the concept of senior water rights [00:01:51]. Urban centers that existed at the time of the 1922 treaty have priority for water allocation, while any infrastructure built since then has lower priority [00:01:54] [00:02:00] [00:02:03]. California, being the most populated state mentioned first in the compact, holds senior water rights [00:02:18] [00:02:22] [00:02:54]. Los Angeles alone has 15 million people, which is more than the entire Southwest's population in 1922 [00:02:24] [00:02:27] [00:02:28].

Arizona, which finished building its Central Arizona Project infrastructure in the late 1960s and 1970s, is at the very bottom of the junior water rights stack [00:02:34] [00:02:37] [00:02:40] [00:02:44] [00:02:46] [00:02:57]. A Supreme Court ruling a few years ago affirmed California's senior rights over Arizona, meaning Arizona's water demand can go to zero before California has to make any cuts [00:02:47] [00:02:51] [00:03:02] [00:03:06]. This ruling has led California to refuse negotiations with other Colorado River Basin states [00:03:10] [00:03:13] [00:03:15]. California's official stance is that other states should cut their water usage to zero before California reduces its own, including for things like golf courses [00:03:31] [00:03:33] [00:03:35].

This stalemate has led to discussions among upstream states about walking away from the compact entirely [00:03:38] [00:03:42]. Such a move would likely result in California suing them, a case California would probably win, but it would take years to resolve in court [00:03:46] [00:03:47] [00:03:50] [00:03:52]. In the interim, Southern California, which receives approximately a third of its water from the Colorado River, could go completely dry, leading to massive economic dislocation [00:03:53] [00:03:55] [00:03:57] [00:03:59] [00:04:02].

## Economic Implications

The [[water_scarcity_in_the_american_southwest | water scarcity in the American Southwest]] has profound economic implications, particularly in an era of deglobalization.

### Industrial Growth and Onshoring

As the world deglobalizes, the United States is seeking to rebuild its industrial capacity [00:04:08] [00:04:10] [00:04:12] [00:04:13]. States are competing to attract new industrial plants [00:04:15]. While Texas and the American South are strong contenders, parts of the Southwest are highly valued for industries like semiconductor fabrication, such as in Phoenix [00:04:19] [00:04:21] [00:04:24] [00:04:27] [00:04:29]. However, these facilities require significant water [00:04:30] [00:04:33].

### Restoring Electronics Supply Chains

Restoring the electronics supply chain system is crucial, and the Southwest is considered the best part of the country for this due to labor reasons [00:04:36] [00:04:38] [00:04:41]. Manufacturing electronics requires a differentiated workforce with various skill sets and price pointsâ€”from lens production to memory boards, plastic molding, and assembly [00:04:44] [00:04:46] [00:04:48] [00:04:51] [00:04:52] [00:04:54] [00:04:55] [00:04:57] [00:04:59] [00:05:00]. This diversity in labor, often found in close proximity, has historically benefited East Asia [00:05:02] [00:05:04] [00:05:06] [00:05:09] [00:05:11]. In North America, this type of variation is primarily found along the U.S.-Mexico border, making the Southwest an attractive location *if* water supply can be maintained [00:05:24] [00:05:26] [00:05:28] [00:05:31] [00:05:34].

### [[impact_of_water_crisis_on_agriculture_and_food_production | Agriculture and Food Security]]

The practice of growing food in the desert Southwest has contributed to the current water crisis [00:05:39] [00:05:41] [00:05:43] [00:05:45]. Although it may not have been an ideal idea initially, this agricultural production is now integral to the national food security system [00:05:48] [00:05:49] [00:05:51] [00:05:52] [00:05:54] [00:05:55]. For example, Yuma, Arizona, relies entirely on water courses governed by the Compact [00:05:57] [00:06:01] [00:06:04] [00:06:06]. If states like Colorado walk away from the compact, the country could lose a quarter to a third of its fresh winter vegetables, as the region has the perfect climate for it, assuming water is available [00:06:07] [00:06:08] [00:06:11] [00:06:13] [00:06:14] [00:06:16]. This potential loss represents a significant amount of food production important across the national system, not just locally or regionally [00:06:39] [00:06:41] [00:06:43] [00:06:45]. California's Central Valley also faces a similar, homegrown ecological and agricultural crisis, distinct from the Colorado River issue [00:06:47] [00:06:49] [00:06:51] [00:06:53] [00:06:56].

## [[demographic_shifts_and_economic_implications | Demographic Shifts and Economic Implications]]

The Southwest has been the fastest-growing part of the U.S. in terms of in-migration for roughly 50 years [00:07:25] [00:07:28] [00:07:30] [00:07:32]. Baby Boomers are moving to warmer climates, while Millennials seek more space and cheaper living, often preferring homes with yards over reliance on mass transit due to disease concerns [00:07:04] [00:07:06] [00:07:07] [00:07:10] [00:07:12] [00:07:13] [00:07:16] [00:07:17] [00:07:19] [00:07:21]. The Southwest generally meets these preferences, and this trend is expected to continue unless a persistent water crisis intervenes [00:07:23] [00:07:25] [00:07:35] [00:07:37] [00:07:38] [00:07:39].

## Potential Solutions and Future Outlook

While challenges exist, America can implement measures to mitigate the [[water_scarcity_in_the_american_southwest | water scarcity in the American Southwest]] [00:07:42] [00:07:43] [00:07:45]. These include:
*   Removing water-intensive agriculture from the region [00:07:48] [00:07:49] [00:07:51].
*   Eliminating water-intensive features like golf courses and fountains in places like Phoenix [00:07:52] [00:07:53] [00:07:54] [00:07:56].
*   Implementing advanced water resource management [00:07:58].

With these measures, the region could potentially increase its population by 50% without issue [00:08:02] [00:08:04].

Crucially, the Colorado Compact must be renegotiated to reflect a more realistic environmental situation [00:08:07] [00:08:09]. Since California is unwilling to negotiate willingly, they will likely have to be forced [00:08:13] [00:08:15] [00:08:16]. This could occur either through a crisis triggered by upstream states or by Congress abrogating the existing pact and imposing a replacement [00:08:19] [00:08:21] [00:08:23] [00:08:26]. This issue is expected to be a contentious political battle for the foreseeable future [00:08:28] [00:08:30]. Resolving the water situation is critical for the Southwest to benefit from the ongoing demographic and geopolitical shifts impacting the world [00:08:33] [00:08:36] [00:08:37] [00:08:39] [00:08:40] [00:08:42] [00:08:45] [00:08:47] [00:08:48] [00:08:50].

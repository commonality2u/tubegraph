The Russian military is increasingly relying on its reserves to sustain the ongoing conflict, leading to the activation of outdated equipment and personnel with minimal training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This reliance highlights significant challenges in the Russian military's capacity and equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Equipment Reserves: The Tank Fleet

Recent engagements have revealed the extent of Russia's equipment issues. In late March, Ukrainian forces defeated a contingent of the 76th Guards Air Assault Group in Zerit Province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This elite unit, known for having some of the best Russian troops and equipment pre-war, was observed fighting with T-55 tanks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

The T-55s, originally built in the 1950s at the start of the Cold War, are considered over half a century outdated by Russian standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. These older tanks are slower, have a shorter firing range, possess thinner armor compared to modern tanks, and require a four-person crew instead of the more standard three, making them more manpower-intensive for less effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

At the beginning of the conflict, Russia had an estimated 12,000 tanks, with about 2,000 in active service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The deployment of T-55s by elite units suggests that the original 2,000 active tanks are now either incapacitated or destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. While Russia possesses deep reserves of another 10,000 tanks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, they are apparently starting with the oldest models first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

This strategy is partly due to refurbishment challenges:
*   **T-55s**: These tanks predate integrated optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, allowing for relatively quick refurbishment by adding inexpensive aftermarket optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Newer Tanks (e.g., T-72s)**: While these tanks originally had optics, 30 years in storage has deteriorated seals and wiring, requiring more complex replacement of existing components rather than simple additions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This process demands more advanced equipment, much of which Russia no longer possesses, making refurbishment of newer tanks significantly more challenging and time-consuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

Consequently, the entire pre-war tank reserve is now depleted, and all tanks being deployed require refurbishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Personnel Reserves: Mobilization and Losses

Similar challenges exist regarding personnel. Estimates suggest that between 550,000 and 750,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or incapacitated since the start of the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This figure represents the entirety of Russia's pre-war army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

As a result, Russia is forced to field newly drafted individuals with minimal training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. While Russia has maintained a "silent draft," unofficially recruiting between 15,000 and 45,000 people monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, this source of manpower is not inexhaustible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. At the war's onset, Russia had approximately 8 million men in their 20s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. With roughly 600,000 killed or incapacitated and another million having fled, this pool has shrunk to about 6.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Implications and Future Outlook

Considering both tank and personnel reserves, Russia could potentially sustain its current pace of conflict for another five to eight years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. After this period, Russia is projected to run out of both equipment and men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

This depletion of pre-war resources means Russia can no longer shuffle assets from other regions within the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. The military is now dependent on a continuous throughput of refurbished equipment, training, and material support, including equipment from other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This reliance means that economic and political factors, both domestically and internationally, now critically influence Russia's ability to maintain its forces at the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

There is no longer "depth" to Russia's military capabilities; any newly acquired resources are immediately deployed to the front to prevent it from emptying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Although Russia may have experienced some momentum recently, such as after the breaking of the Avdiivka front, the front has largely become static again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Russian efforts to find weak points, like the attacks by the 76th Guards, are resulting in high casualties, indicating that the current pace cannot be sustained indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

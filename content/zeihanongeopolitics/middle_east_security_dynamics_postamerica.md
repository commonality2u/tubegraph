As the [[us_policy_shift_in_the_middle_east | United States]] reduces its role as a global guarantor, countries are increasingly forced to prioritize their own security and needs, leading to significant shifts in regional dynamics, particularly in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This analysis focuses on Israel's evolving position in a "post-American" world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Israel's Domestic Challenges

Israel faces internal demographic and economic challenges that will impact its future power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. A segment of its population receives social support to study the Torah, does not serve in the military, and does not work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This group has a higher birth rate, and within 30 to 40 years, it is projected to be nearly as populous as the rest of the country combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This demographic trend is already a significant burden on the country's tax base and manpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Consequently, the Israel of the future is unlikely to be as powerful as it has been, as a third to half of its population potentially relying on state support will limit its capacity to research technology or staff its military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This necessitates that Israel act with more decisive "punch" given its inability to rely on future population or economic strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## US Disengagement and Israel's Evolving Security Needs

With the [[us_involvement_in_the_middle_east_and_challenges_in_global_security | United States]] becoming broadly disinterested in the world and particularly in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, Israel must either secure its own safety or find a new security guarantor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Potential Security Guarantors
*   **Russia**: Ruled out due to distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **United Kingdom**: Considered, but the UK will likely face more pressing domestic issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **France**: A possibility, but France struggles to project power beyond the Western Mediterranean due to Turkey's control of the Eastern Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Turkey as a Key Regional Ally
Turkey emerges as the most viable local military power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Turkey possesses naval superiority in the Eastern Mediterranean and the second-largest armor in NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Although relations between Israel and Turkey soured over a decade ago due to issues related to Gaza and Turkish President Erdogan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, cooperation on military and intelligence matters has steadily increased in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. While Israel may not fully operate "under the Turkish wing," it must forge a deal with the dominant local military power, which is unequivocally Turkey in the absence of the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This alliance could help Israel address threats from Syria and Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Relations with Jordan and Egypt
To the immediate south and east, Jordan and Egypt have been in a state of co-dominion with Israel, largely due to US financial aid compelling them not to pose a threat to Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. While this aid may cease, both governments are currently unstable, posing a greater risk of collapse than of initiating conflict with Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## Israel's Emerging Alliance with Saudi Arabia

Israel's primary concerns lie further east, specifically with Iraq and Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. In response, Israel has found a new partner in Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Saudi Arabia's Contributions to the Alliance
Saudi Arabia offers several key assets to Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>:
*   **Intelligence**: Valuable intelligence on the Shia world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Proximity**: Strategic positioning for direct military strikes and basing if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Religious Influence**: Nominal control over Sunni Muslim religion through the shrines in Mecca and Medina, granting significant credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Warming Relations and US Disengagement
The warming relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia have coincided with a reduction in transnational attacks on Israeli interests, both physical and diplomatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Formal recognition between the two nations is anticipated, likely after the current Saudi King, who is relatively pro-Palestinian, is succeeded by Muhammad bin Salman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

The alliance is already robust, with shared intelligence on Iran and collaboration in third countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. From the Saudi perspective, Israel is seen as more reliable than the [[the_impact_of_us_disengagement_from_the_middle_east | Americans]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. During the Cold War, the US maintained its presence in the [[middle_east_geopolitics_and_oil_reliance | Persian Gulf]] to ensure oil flow to its allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. However, with reduced US reliance on foreign energy and a shift away from a broader alliance structure, Saudi Arabia has become less important to the US, allowing other issues like human rights records and the war in Yemen to gain prominence on the US agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Consequently, US military aid and training to Saudi Arabia have decreased over the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Israel has stepped in to fill this "American Gap" by purchasing US military equipment, adding its own expertise, and transferring it to Riyadh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

## Future Conflicts in the Middle East

The major unanswered question in a post-American world is whether the Israel-Saudi alliance can withstand a conflict with Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. One of three major [[geopolitical_tensions_in_the_middle_east | military conflicts]] projected for this decade is a fight for control of the [[strategic_vulnerabilities_and_targets_in_the_middle_east | Persian Gulf]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. This conflict will pit Iran against Saudi Arabia, with Israel definitively supporting the Saudis and Turkey potentially acting as a "wild card" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

This region is expected to experience significant turmoil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Unlike conflicts where countries collapse quickly due to severed energy and food connections, the nations involved in the Middle East possess the financial capacity and geographic insulation to engage in prolonged conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Israel will play a critical role in determining Saudi Arabia's success in this future conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

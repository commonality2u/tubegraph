The 2024 federal elections did not unfold as anticipated, prompting a post-mortem analysis of shifting political dynamics in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Historical Electoral Deciders: The Independents

For the past three decades, most elections, particularly at the presidential level, have been determined by a small group of Americans who self-identify as independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   Roughly 30% of the American population identifies as Democrats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   Roughly 30% identifies as Republicans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   The remaining 40% identify as Independents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
Despite 40% self-identifying as independent, over three-quarters of this group consistently vote for one party or the other, more than 90% of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
This leaves a thin sliver of 5% to 10% of voters who have historically been the balance of power in the American political system for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This group has voted for various presidents, including Obama (twice), W (twice), Biden, and Trump, even kicking Trump out of office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## The 2022 Midterms: A "Red Fizzle"

Leading up to the 2022 midterms, Donald Trump's rhetoric, suggesting that Independents' votes didn't matter and that decisions should be made at the primary level, angered "America's True Independents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. As a result, in almost all races where Trump endorsed a candidate, Democrats won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. What was anticipated to be a "red wave" for Republicans turned into, at best, a "red fizzle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## 2024 Election Analysis: Unexpected Shifts

In the 2024 federal election, it appears that the prediction regarding Independents largely held true, as they broke very strongly against Trump for the third election in a row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. However, other voter groups shifted differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. A significant "bleed over" occurred, with support for the "elite-led" group (Democrats) being lost to Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Breakdown of the Democratic Alliance Pillars

The traditional Democratic Alliance is understood to be supported by three main pillars:
1.  Coastal, primarily white, primarily college-educated elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
2.  Minorities of all types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
3.  Organized labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

In this election, many of these pillars broke:
*   Unmarried women, a significant part of the alliance, shifted to Trump by five points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   Youth (18-29 year olds), who almost always vote Democrat, broke towards Trump by 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   Black men shifted to Trump by 7% more than before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   Non-white college graduates shifted by 9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   Asians shifted by 11% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   People in the lower-income bracket (earning $30,000-$49,000) broke 12% for Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   Latinos shifted by 17%, with Latino men specifically shifting by 22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

These shifts indicate that groups traditionally associated with the Democratic party are no longer tightly linked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

## Key Trends and Future Implications

### 1. [[political_realignment_in_the_united_states | Political Realignment]]

The United States is currently experiencing a period of [[political_realignment_in_the_united_states | political realignment]], with party loyalties visibly shifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Voter participation dropped by over 10% between 2020 and 2024, suggesting that Donald Trump no longer has the same motivating factor (for or against) that he once did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### 2. Birth of a New Party and Demise of the Traditional Democratic Party

With political factions in motion, a new party is emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. While it's unclear if the current alignment that brought Trump to power for a second term (referred to as "Maga" rather than the Republican Alliance) is permanent, it signifies the end of the traditional Democratic party as it was known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

*   **Organized Labor:** Organized labor is now, at best from a Democratic perspective, a swing vote, with over half voting for Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   **Minorities, particularly Hispanics:** Hispanics are the fastest-growing demographic in the country, largely due to immigration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. They are also the group most opposed to migration in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Donald Trump's focus on the southern border resonated deeply with many Hispanics who had previously crossed it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

The loss of these two key pillars—Hispanics and organized labor—from the Democratic Alliance means that any local political areas where these groups are significant are now highly contested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Without significant self-reflection and realignment, a party based solely on "white coastal educated elites" cannot win federal elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

### 3. Coming Constitutional Crisis

A constitutional crisis is anticipated in the next few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Concerns are raised about Donald Trump's mental acuity, noting he is older now than Joe Biden was when he became president four years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. The chance of Trump serving a full term without a significant decline in mental capacity is considered "vanishingly small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

Unlike Joe Biden, who has peers and confidants to offer advice, Donald Trump's "Maga party" is described as a cult of personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. He has purged anyone who might challenge him and his new cabinet is expected to exclude those who have questioned his decisions in the past, including figures like Mike Pompeo and Nikki Haley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. The question of how to remove a president who has lost mental capacity, particularly one who will not willingly step down, presents an unprecedented constitutional crisis for the country and a leadership crisis for the Maga movement, as Trump is synonymous with Maga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

These combined trends—voter apathy, the breakdown of the Democratic coalition without a clear replacement, and the anticipated demise of Donald Trump without a clear successor—are expected to lead to a turbulent political period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

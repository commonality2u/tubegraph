Modern warfare has seen a significant evolution with the introduction and widespread deployment of [[drones_and_autonomous_warfare | combat drones]], marking a notable shift in [[changes_in_battlefield_strategies_and_dynamics | battlefield strategies and dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

## Case Study: Azerbaijan-Armenia Conflict

A pivotal moment demonstrating the transformative power of [[drones_and_autonomous_warfare | drones]] occurred in the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. Approximately two years prior to the discussion, Azerbaijan acquired a substantial number of Turkish [[drones_and_autonomous_warfare | combat drones]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

### Impact of Drones

The introduction of these [[drones_and_autonomous_warfare | drones]] led to a swift and decisive victory for Azerbaijan in a conflict lasting under a month, during which they "decisively destroyed every Armenian Force they came up against" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. This marked the first instance where [[drones_and_autonomous_warfare | drones]] were observed in combat as a primary component of military strategy, rather than solely for reconnaissance or assassination operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

The [[drones_and_autonomous_warfare | drones]] were the "Mainstay of the Asperjani effort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Despite Azerbaijani ground troops being considered "broadly incompetent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>, the [[drones_and_autonomous_warfare | drones]] enabled them to make significant advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. If a similar conflict were to occur again, with [[drones_and_autonomous_warfare | drones]] clearing the path, Azerbaijani forces would likely be able to advance further and capture more territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.

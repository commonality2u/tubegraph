Russian cyber crime has been perceived as a significant threat, often described as the "Boogeyman" in discussions concerning Ukraine and the general collapse of international relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Despite Russia being a former superpower with a somewhat intact intelligence apparatus, the anticipated large-scale cyber attacks against civilian systems have not materialized a year into the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

There are three primary reasons cited for the lower-than-expected [[impact_of_prolonged_russian_cyber_attacks | impact of prolonged Russian cyber attacks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Reasons for Limited Impact

### Experience and Preparedness
NATO countries have gained significant experience defending against [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russian]] cyber attacks over several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Estonia, a country with a population of less than 1.5 million, has been a primary target and is now considered to have the best counter-cyber capabilities globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Estonia has moved most of its government services online, making them relatively hack-proof, and has actively cooperated with other European countries, including Ukraine, to build up cyber defenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Time and Evolving Defenses
The prolonged nature of [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russian]] cyber activities has provided ample time for potential targets to gain exposure and strengthen their defenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Consequently, systems are less exposed today than they were five or ten years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The ongoing war in Ukraine has prompted many companies and countries to adopt a more proactive stance on cyber defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:26]</a>.

### US Cyber Defense and Offense Strategies
The [[us_cyber_defense_and_offense_strategies | US cyber defense and offense strategies]] contrasts sharply with that of Russia, contributing to the mitigated impact of Russian cyber activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

#### US Approach
During the Reagan administration in the 1980s, the US decided against a national cyber defense, instead concentrating all cyber offense under the National Security Agency (NSA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:47]</a>. The NSA's strategy has been to continuously hack non-allied nations (excluding New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Canada) to learn their architecture, insert backdoors, and collect passwords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:02:04]</a>. This offensive focus means that in a "hot war," the NSA could "obliterate" an opposing side's infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:33]</a>. However, the domestic weakness of this strategy is the lack of national cyber defense, leaving individual entities largely on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:20]</a>. In peacetime, the NSA's strategy has been to "keep dry powder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:43]</a>.

Under Donald Trump's presidency, this strategy evolved slightly; after his first election, he ordered the NSA to send cease and desist letters, including personal details, to [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russian]] government hackers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:03:11]</a>.

#### Russian Cyber System
The Russian cyber system differs significantly from the US model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:20]</a>. It includes:
*   **State Agencies:** A formal state agency exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Bot Farms:** A "bot arm" has been active in spreading disinformation among groups like religious fanatics, environmental activists, and anti-vaxxers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:38]</a>. These operations have also been linked to manipulating social movements like "Blue Lives Matter" and "Black Lives Matter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Private Organized Crime:** The majority of Russia's cyber capacity resides with private [[role_of_organized_crime_in_russian_cyber_operations | organized crime groups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:53]</a>. These groups typically focus on financial crimes, such as credit card fraud, bank account takeovers, and ransomware attacks against institutions like hospitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:04:02]</a>. This highlights the deep [[russias_organized_crime_and_government_connections | connections between Russia's organized crime and government]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:53]</a>.

#### US Counter-Operations During Ukraine War
At the onset of the war in Ukraine, it became apparent that the state cyber power in Russia was not as formidable as initially believed, while the role of organized crime was more significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:11]</a>. The Biden administration unofficially "dropped a hammer" on many of these [[role_of_organized_crime_in_russian_cyber_operations | organized crime groups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:17]</a>. Unlike state actors, crime-oriented cyber groups lack robust defense capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:24]</a>. Early in the war, within the first couple of weeks, significant portions of the Russian cyber infrastructure were "shattered" by unofficial US cyber capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:32]</a>. This disruption has severely hampered their ability to conduct more than superficial attacks on Ukrainian or Western systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:41]</a>. The US government has employed these cyber tools in a tangible way not seen in the last 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:52]</a>.

Recent economic data indicates that [[chinas_demographic_challenges | China]] is either currently in recession or very close to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The expected economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic did not materialize in [[chinas_demographic_challenges | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## [[chinese_demographics_and_population_collapse | Population Collapse]]

Newer and more accurate demographic data suggests that [[chinas_demographic_challenges | China]] has experienced a significant [[chinese_demographics_and_population_collapse | population collapse]] that began some time ago, not recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

Key demographic indicators include:
*   The American birth rate has surpassed the [[chinas_demographic_challenges | Chinese]] birth rate since the mid-1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   This trend implies that [[chinas_demographic_challenges | China]] is not only running out of children but is now experiencing a shortage of working-age adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   Recent data from the past few weeks reveals a substantial decline in kindergarten enrollment, indicating that birth rates significantly dropped approximately five years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   Cumulatively, these factors mean that [[chinas_demographic_challenges | China]] is facing a deficit of people under the age of 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## [[implications_of_chinas_demographic_data_for_the_economy | Economic Implications]]

The severe [[demographic_challenges_facing_china | demographic challenges facing China]] have significant economic ramifications:

*   The likelihood of [[chinas_demographic_challenges | China]] achieving any consumption-driven economic activity is considered nil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   This situation poses a major problem for countries that traditionally export raw materials to [[chinas_demographic_challenges | China]], including Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   European and Japanese economies, which also rely heavily on exporting to [[chinas_demographic_challenges | China]], face a similar, though distinct, set of problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

If major economies like [[chinas_demographic_challenges | China]], Europe, and Northeast Asia are experiencing a slowdown, it suggests that the global economy has likely passed its last major period of widespread growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This leaves primarily North America as the region currently experiencing robust economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

The future of relations between the United States and the Arab states in the Persian Gulf, particularly Saudi Arabia, is not promising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Historical US Engagement in the Persian Gulf

During the era of globalization, the United States required oil from the Persian Gulf not for its own consumption, but for its allies, including Japan, [[economic_and_military_relationships_in_the_middle_east | China]], Korea, Taiwan, France, Germany, Italy, and Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. These nations lacked sufficient domestic oil capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. To incentivize them to join the global order and oppose the Soviet Union during the Cold War, the US guaranteed their fuel supply, negating their need to develop their own naval forces to secure oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

The US historically sourced most of its oil from North America, with lesser amounts from Venezuela and Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Crude imports from the Middle East never exceeded approximately 20% of US supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. The United States had consistently appeased Saudi Arabia for 75 years because controlling Saudi oil was key to securing crude from other Gulf states like Kuwait, the UAE, and Qatar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Shifting US Energy Landscape and Disengagement

The advent of the shale revolution significantly altered US energy dependence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Crude imports from the Middle East to the US plummeted to zero, leading to Saudi supertankers no longer being needed off the coast of Louisiana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Imports from Africa also ceased, and Venezuela's output declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Currently, the United States and Canada are largely self-sufficient in energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

Under the administrations of Barack Obama and Donald Trump, the US adopted a more disengaged foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The presence of US aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf, once one or two at a time, is now rare unless there's an active crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This reflects a shift in US strategic priorities towards domestic concerns and East Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. For example, the US showed indifference to Kuwait's recent discovery of an offshore oil field, indicating the withdrawal of security guarantees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Future of US-Saudi Relations

In a post-globalized world where the US is energy self-sufficient and can even export to allies, its role shifts from a guarantor of global energy supplies to a potential disruptor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. This change means that reliable energy supplies globally are no longer seen as a strategic necessity for the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Potential US Actions Against Saudi Arabia

The relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia is expected to decline significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Saudi Arabia's oil fields rely heavily on expatriate labor; simply denying them staff could halt production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Additionally, Saudi oil is primarily exported through a few terminals, and Saudi Arabia lacks a substantial navy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Future US options could include:
*   Embargoing Saudi oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>
*   Destroying offshore loading facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>
*   Seizing tankers as they leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>

These actions would stem from a US decision to not want the oil, nor want others to have it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Without oil, the region is perceived by some in the US business community as prone to domestic violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Current Transition Phase

While the long-term outlook is for a severing of ties, this process is still in motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. The Biden administration's actions demonstrate a continued need for alliance structures to achieve specific goals, such as support in the Ukraine War and containing [[economic_and_military_relationships_in_the_middle_east | China]] regarding semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. As long as the US values its alliances, there is a perceived need for crude to flow unimpeded from the Persian Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

The future relationship will likely involve a middle ground where the US influences or forces the region to be more selective about its crude sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Should direct conflict with [[economic_and_military_relationships_in_the_middle_east | China]] occur, the US could place ships in the Strait of Hormuz to prevent crude from reaching [[economic_and_military_relationships_in_the_middle_east | China]], which would halt the entire region's operations within three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Saudi Arabia's Security Dilemma

Saudi Arabia's historical view was that its vast oil reserves meant it could simply pay others, particularly the United States, to defend it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. They believed they could buy US military equipment, store it, and then call upon the American president to fight their wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. This belief was shattered by the Iraq War in 2003, which the Saudis opposed but happened nonetheless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

As the US disengages, Saudi Arabia will need a new security guarantor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. The list of potential candidates with a blue-water navy capable of long-distance deployment or marching to Saudi Arabia is short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>:
*   **[[economic_and_military_relationships_in_the_middle_east | China]]**: Lacks the necessary range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **Japan**: Has the capability but has not moved far enough past its pacifist stance to invest in an army for such a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. [[economic_and_military_relationships_in_the_middle_east | Japan]] and the US appear to be settling for co-dominion over the Pacific, which includes energy security for [[economic_and_military_relationships_in_the_middle_east | Japan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Britain and France**: The UAE has already engaged in military cooperation with France, including a French base in the UAE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. However, Saudi Arabia would prefer not to align with a European power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Turkey**: Could march through Iraq directly to Riyadh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. However, this scenario would introduce a superior military power with easy access to Saudi Arabia, creating a major dilemma for the Saudis: why would Turkey defend Saudi Arabia rather than simply take it over? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

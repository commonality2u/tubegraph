Donald Trump has stated his willingness to use economic coercion against [[canadas_relationship_with_the_united_states | Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. While he does not propose military force against [[canadas_relationship_with_the_united_states | Canada]], his intent is to apply economic pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Economic Integration and Trade Deficits

[[canadas_relationship_with_the_united_states | Canada]] is described as an ally and economically integrated with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Approximately 90% of [[canadas_relationship_with_the_united_states | Canada]]'s population resides close to the southern border with the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. All mainland Canadian provinces, from British Columbia to Nova Scotia, engage in more north-south trade with the United States than east-west trade with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

The concept of "trade deficits" used in this context is considered a flawed measure because these provinces are effectively part of the American [[canadas_economic_and_trade_relations_with_the_united_states | economic]] space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Tariffs to address a trade deficit would be akin to taxing trade between U.S. states like Texas and Mississippi, which is illogical within a single [[canadas_economic_and_trade_relations_with_the_united_states | economic]] area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Therefore, attempting to rectify a trade deficit by targeting [[canadas_relationship_with_the_united_states | Canada]] would be disrupting what is essentially internal U.S. trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## Demographic Challenges and Potential Integration Costs

A key consideration regarding [[potential_economic_and_political_integration_between_the_us_and_canada | integrating]] [[canadas_relationship_with_the_united_states | Canada]] is its [[comparison_of_us_and_canadian_demographics | demographic]] structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Unlike the U.S., which largely remains at a "chimney" stage (stable age distribution), [[canadas_relationship_with_the_united_states | Canada]]'s [[comparison_of_us_and_canadian_demographics | demographics]] have "opened up," with some provinces showing an inverted pyramid structure, indicating an aging and declining workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

If [[canadas_relationship_with_the_united_states | Canada]] were to [[potential_economic_and_political_integration_between_the_us_and_canada | merge]] with the United States, forming new states, the costs would be substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Even disregarding [[canadas_relationship_with_the_united_states | Canada]]'s social welfare model, integrating its aging populations into the American system (Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid) would add an estimated $500 billion to $1 trillion to the U.S. federal budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

*   **Quebec:** Demographically, Quebec would be the oldest of any new states, posing a significant financial burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   **Atlantic Provinces:** Labrador, PEI, and Nova Scotia are in an even worse [[comparison_of_us_and_canadian_demographics | demographic]] position than Quebec, though they represent less than 10% of [[canadas_relationship_with_the_united_states | Canada]]'s population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Ontario:** As the largest province [[canadas_economic_and_trade_relations_with_the_united_states | economically]] and [[comparison_of_us_and_canadian_demographics | demographically]], Ontario is rapidly aging into a Quebec-like inversion, promising another massive outlay within one to two decades <a class="yt_timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

A more plausible scenario for [[potential_economic_and_political_integration_between_the_us_and_canada | Canadian-American merger]] might involve western provinces like Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Alberta choosing to join the U.S. for [[canadas_economic_and_trade_relations_with_the_united_states | economic]] reasons, to avoid paying for the substantial retirement costs of Quebec and Ontario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. This concept was explored in the "Alberta Question" chapter of the book *Accidental Superpower* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

## Canada as a Strategic Ally

[[canadas_relationship_with_the_united_states | Canada]] is considered an important ally to the U.S., particularly in missile defense, where collaboration is seamless due to the necessity of protecting the homeland from missiles potentially crossing Canadian airspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. While minor disputes exist, primarily regarding NATO spending, fundamental security cooperation with [[canadas_relationship_with_the_united_states | Canada]] remains strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

Using economic coercion or threatening [[canadas_relationship_with_the_united_states | Canada]], the United States' second-largest trading partner, to extract financial commitments is seen as "bad math" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Such actions are hoped to be mere "bluster and threats" rather than serious policy intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

While much of the global economy faces significant headwinds, North America stands out as a region experiencing relatively strong economic performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This contrasts sharply with other major economies, including the United Kingdom, Japan, and Germany, all of which are in recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. China is also either in recession or very close, based on available data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Other regions, such as Israel, the Netherlands, most of Scandinavia, and Western Europe, are experiencing slow growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, and even growing economies like India are doing so at a slow pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Australia and New Zealand are also nearing recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

[[future_prospects_for_global_economic_systems | Future prospects for global economic systems]] suggest that a major period of global economic growth may have concluded, leaving North America as a leading economic player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. The United States, in particular, is experiencing record growth due to a combination of factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Drivers of North American Economic Growth

### Millennial Consumption
A significant factor contributing to growth in the U.S. is millennial consumption. This demographic group still has many years remaining in their consumption-heavy age bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### Government Investment
Substantial government investment from the Biden Administration is also spurring growth in the short and midterm, although this may lead to future debt issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Industrial Construction Boom
The United States has seen an explosion in industrial construction spending over the past several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This trend is driven by the realization that if goods are still desired, they must be manufactured domestically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This industrial build-out is expected to continue for at least another decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

These factors position North America as increasingly promising for [[North Americas economic opportunities in response to global shifts | domestic growth]], especially as other nations struggle with consumption-led and export-led growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Global Economic Context and Decline of Other Regions

Many other global economies are struggling due to a combination of factors, including demographics and shifts in global trade.

### China's Demographic Challenges
China's anticipated post-COVID economic bounce never materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Detailed demographic data reveals a significant population collapse that began earlier than previously understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The American birth rate has surpassed China's since the mid-1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, indicating that China is now running out of working-age adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Recent data also shows a drastic shortage of children entering kindergarten, suggesting a sharp drop in births approximately five years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. As a result, China is facing a severe shortage of people under 50, making consumption-driven economic activity virtually impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This presents a major challenge for countries like Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia, which rely on exporting raw materials to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### [[European demographic trends and economic impacts | European and Northeast Asian Demographic Trends]]
For Europeans and Japanese, the problem is also demographic but further along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. On average, half of the world's Baby Boomers have already retired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Countries like Italy hit this trend early, Germany is currently experiencing it, and Korea is approaching it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Spain and the Netherlands are also in precarious positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Consumption typically declines after one's mid-40s, and it plummets upon retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Large parts of the advanced world have reached this point, limiting the possibility of consumption-led growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. With export-led growth to China also constrained, and potential market closures by the U.S., many economies are left with limited options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

This global landscape suggests a sharply bifurcated world, where North America's domestic growth prospects appear increasingly strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

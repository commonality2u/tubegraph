The United States has undergone a significant [[shifts_in_us_foreign_policy_and_its_implications | shift in its foreign policy]], particularly regarding international energy markets and the global maritime order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This [[shift_in_us_global_strategic_role | shift in US global strategic role]] has profound implications for global economies, especially for China.

## Historical US Global Role
Historically, the post-World War II global environment established by the United States was based on a commitment to protect resource and product flows internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This policy ensured that allies would supplement their military needs to the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The US essentially fought allies' "economic wars" to give itself a free hand and control of allied militaries, particularly in the context of a confrontation with the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. While the US did not import much oil from the Middle East, its allies did, necessitating this protective stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Current US Policy Shift
The United States has steadily reduced its commitment to the maritime order that underpins global trade and energy markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This [[us_policy_shift_in_the_middle_east | US policy shift in the Middle East]] has been consistent across administrations, including Obama, Trump, and Biden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. A recent example of this disengagement occurred when Iran seized the Suez Max oil tanker "Advantage Suite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The US Navy's response was limited to a press release stating, "bad Iran, very very bad Iran," indicating a lack of direct intervention or concern for international energy markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Impact on China
This [[influence_of_global_dynamics_on_us_policy_priorities | influence of global dynamics on US policy priorities]] and the subsequent [[impact_of_global_geopolitical_issues_on_us_foreign_policy_focus | impact of global geopolitical issues on US foreign policy focus]] pose a significant problem for China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The entire existence of the Chinese economy and its strategic position has been predicated on the assumption that the United States would uphold civilian Freedom of the Seas, regardless of China's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. However, the US now has no interest in maintaining this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

If international energy flows are meaningfully interrupted, the US, being self-sufficient within North America, can simply close its borders to energy trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. China, conversely, is at the very end of a long supply line that it cannot protect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This vulnerability means China would likely de-industrialize, leading to the potential end of China's unified nation-state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This is considered one of many reasons why China may face collapse by the end of the current decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This scenario directly relates to the broader [[impact_of_chinese_collapse_on_global_supply_chains_and_us_industrial_growth | impact of Chinese collapse on global supply chains and US industrial growth]] and highlights the severe implications for [[chinas_trade_relationship_with_the_united_states | China's trade relationship with the United States]] and the global economy, as well as [[potential_conflict_scenarios_between_china_and_the_united_states | potential conflict scenarios between China and the United States]].

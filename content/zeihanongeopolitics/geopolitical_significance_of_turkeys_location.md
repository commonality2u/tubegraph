Turkey has historically been a major global power, with its origins tracing back to the 1200s when Turks settled in the territory now known as Istanbul after splitting from the Mongol hordes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. For centuries, Turkey has been an integral part of [[geopolitical_tensions_in_the_middle_east | Middle Eastern]] and [[turkeys_potential_alliances_and_conflicts_in_europe_and_the_middle_east | European politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Following their defeat in World War I, which shattered their political and economic orders, Turkey largely withdrew from history for most of the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. It is only with the rise of the current president, Erdoğan, in recent decades that Turkey has begun to re-emerge and rediscover its complex surrounding world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

Many current problems in the southern Balkans, the Levant, and Mesopotamia can be linked to the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire (the Sublime Port) a century ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. As Turkey reasserts itself, it faces numerous decisions regarding its future role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Strategic Importance of Istanbul and the Turkish Straits

Turkey's immense importance is largely due to its geographical location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Istanbul, situated on the Golden Horn, controls the Turkish Straits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. These straits are the sole water passage between the Mediterranean (and beyond it, the Atlantic and Indian Oceans) and the [[turkish_strategic_policy_on_the_black_sea | Black Sea]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

From the [[turkish_strategic_policy_on_the_black_sea | Black Sea]], navigable rivers like the Don, Dnieper, and Dniester extend deep into the Ukrainian and even Russian interior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. A canal connecting the Don to the Volga further extends this reach to Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This makes Istanbul a crucial water linkage point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

By land, routes extend east from Anatolia to Persia, India, and China, or northwest through the Balkans into Europe via the Danube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. In any scenario where global trade is restricted, Istanbul stands as arguably the wealthiest and most strategically important city economically on the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Impact of the American Global Order

For the past 70 years, Turkey's strategic geography was less critical due to the [[turkeys_strategic_options_post_american_global_order | American global order]], which ensured safe passage across the world's seas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This period allowed any nation with access to a body of water to engage in global trade, unlike the pre-globalized era where navies jealously guarded their commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This shift transformed Turkey's geography from one of the best to arguably among the worst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

However, as the United States gradually withdraws its guardianship from global waterways, Turkey's importance is incrementally increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. As Turkey re-expands its influence into former imperial territories, it finds that these regions have developed their own perspectives, though most lack significant power or competence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. With the possible exception of Iran, no country within Turkey's immediate reach can meaningfully challenge it economically, politically, or militarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This presents Turkey with a wide range of strategic options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Re-emerging Influence and Regional Options

While Turkey can move in any direction, it lacks the power to pursue all options simultaneously and must make choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### To the North: Ukraine and the Black Sea

Turkey has historical influence in Ukraine, having previously controlled the mouths of the Dnieper and Dniester rivers, which helped keep the Russian Empire at bay for a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Turkish naval forces from Istanbul would regularly sail upriver during thaws to disrupt Russian constructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. In the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, while Turkey maintains political and economic neutrality, it strategically supports Ukraine by providing drones, understanding that a Russian defeat would primarily benefit Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### To the Northeast: The [[geopolitical_tensions_in_the_middle_east | Caucasus]]

The [[geopolitical_tensions_in_the_middle_east | Caucasus]] region is often described as a place where empires falter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. However, it also presents opportunities, particularly in the industrial age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Azerbaijan, an oil producer (approximately one million barrels daily), sends its oil through the [[geopolitical_tensions_in_the_middle_east | Caucasus]] region, ultimately reaching Turkey via pipelines to the super-port of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean or through [[turkish_strategic_policy_on_the_black_sea | Black Sea]] naval routes that pass through Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This makes Turkey an essential part of any plan to utilize the region's resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

Azerbaijan, one of the three [[geopolitical_tensions_in_the_middle_east | Caucasus]] nations, is ethnically Turkic and has historically been allied with Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Recently, in 2023, the [[potential_geopolitical_alliances_for_armenia | Armenian]] military was largely defeated, and Azerbaijan recaptured territory previously lost to Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. The future of the [[potential_geopolitical_alliances_for_armenia | Armenian]] state is now in question, with Turkey being the primary potential broker for any resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

### To the East: Iran

Moving directly east, Turkey borders Iranian Azerbaijan, an area with a similar ethnic group to independent Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Iran has always been wary of an independent Azerbaijan because more Azeris live within Iran itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. These Iranian Azeris are also ethnic kin to Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. While a full-scale conflict with Iran would be a significant undertaking due to the mountainous terrain, the Turkish military (one of the world's best) would likely prevail over Iran's less-trained infantry in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. Such an engagement, however, would demand a serious commitment from Turkey, limiting other actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

### To the Southeast: Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf

To the southeast lies Mesopotamia, home to Kurdish minorities across Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This region is rich in oil and gas, as well as some wheat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Access to the Persian Gulf from this direction would enable Turkey to become a key player in the world's largest free energy market, especially as global energy trade is no longer protected by the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

### To the South: The Levant and Israel

Directly south, Turkey borders the Levant, where [[israels_potential_alliances_with_turkey_and_saudi_arabia | Israel]] is located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. During the first half of the Cold War, Turkey and [[israels_potential_alliances_with_turkey_and_saudi_arabia | Israel]] were close allies, along with Iran until 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. This alliance persisted until Erdoğan's leadership, as he holds a negative view of [[israels_potential_alliances_with_turkey_and_saudi_arabia | Israel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Erdoğan's stance reflects a desire to reclaim the Ottoman Turks' historical role as economic, political, military, and religious leaders, with Islam's leadership once based in Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. The idea of Jews, primarily of Western European descent, "oppressing" Palestinian Arabs and Muslims is seen as problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

While a conflict with [[israels_potential_alliances_with_turkey_and_saudi_arabia | Israel]] would require invading Syria and Lebanon first (a situation nobody desires), it's more likely the two nations will continue to glare at each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. A more advantageous strategy would be cooperation, as an alliance between Turkey and [[israels_potential_alliances_with_turkey_and_saudi_arabia | Israel]] could easily exclude other powers from the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. Such cooperation could also project power into Egypt to control the Suez Canal, generating significant revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

### To the Southwest: Eastern Mediterranean, Cyprus, and Greece

The Eastern Mediterranean, including Cyprus and Greece, is a region of geopolitical interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. While not economically rich, the Aegean is the first point of access to the wider world past Istanbul via that vector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Therefore, some form of understanding, *modus vivendi*, or occupation of these lands by Turkey is necessary to ensure broader access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. However, relations between Greeks and Turks are poor, and Turks and Cypriots harbor deep animosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Involvement in this mountainous, naval-heavy region, where Turkey is often engaged elsewhere, could also allow other naval powers, like France, to intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### To the Northwest: Southern Balkans (Romania and Bulgaria)

To the Northwest lies the Southern Balkans, specifically Romania and Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. This area features the lowlands of the Danube river system, which extend into northern Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. These two countries have sophisticated populations among Turkey's neighbors and offer opportunities for economic activity, energy reserves, and food supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Additionally, the Carpathian and Balkan mountains block Romania and Bulgaria from the rest of Europe, making them easier to defend and more naturally within Turkey's sphere of influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## Choices and Limitations

Turkey faces an "embarrassment of opportunities" and possesses significant strength, but not enough to seize every possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. From a strategic perspective, two primary directions are most logical:

1.  **The Balkan Vector**: Bulgarians and Romanians have existing relationships with Turkey, ranging from warm to cool, and view each other as relatively reliable economic and security partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. The historical animosity from the late Ottoman period is largely behind them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. If the U.S. withdraws its interest from the region, these countries primarily face Russia, an experience they would prefer to avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
2.  **A Deal with [[israels_potential_alliances_with_turkey_and_saudi_arabia | Israel]]**: This would allow Turkey to bypass Greece, bring the Suez Canal within its sphere of influence, and make it more difficult for other naval powers (e.g., Britain, France) to project power from the Western into the Eastern Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

Ultimately, history demands difficult choices, and Turkey is no exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

Australia's economy is significantly shaped by its role as a major raw commodities producer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The nation is a primary global supplier of materials such as bauxite, iron ore, natural gas, and lithium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Deep Economic Ties with China

For most of the last 40 years, [[Australias economic relationship with China | China]] has been Australia's number one customer for the majority of these raw commodities, with these figures consistently increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Australia has developed the deepest economic ties with [[Chinas economic dependency on exports | China]] among all Western nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This relationship has often been characterized by [[Chinas import dependency on energy and materials | China's]] "hyper-financialization system," which involves printing money and creating bank deposits to fuel industrial development, even if the projects are not economically viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. [[Chinas economic dependency on exports | China's]] approach has been largely price-insensitive, willing to purchase almost any raw material at any cost to achieve its political goals, primarily infrastructure and industrial plant construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Australia has been arguably the single largest supplier to [[Chinas economic dependency on exports | China]] throughout this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Future Challenges of Chinese Demand

This deep reliance on [[Chinas economic dependency on exports | Chinese]] demand presents a problem moving forward because much of it has never been economically viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. When [[Chinas potential collapse and its impact on global industry | Chinese demand for raw commodities diminishes]], Australia will need to sell to more economically rational markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. While the market may not entirely collapse, the "balls-to-the-wall" price-insensitive expansion seen over the last few decades will not continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Australia will be able to replace some [[Chinas economic dependency on exports | Chinese]] demand with markets elsewhere, particularly as the [[Impact of the Shale Revolution on US industry | U.S.]] re-industrializes and Southeast Asia takes on some industrial roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. However, collectively, this new demand is not expected to be as significant as what [[Chinas economic dependency on exports | China]] previously extracted from the Australian economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, leading to a potentially harsh economic adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Failure to Move Up the Value Chain

A significant challenge for Australia is its consistent failure to move up the value-added scale within its raw materials industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Australia has remained primarily a raw commodities provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

For example:
*   Despite producing iron ore, Australia does not produce steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   Despite producing lithium, Australia does not produce batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   Despite producing natural gas, Australia does not produce chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   Despite producing wheat, Australia does not produce flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

Instead, commodities are simply extracted from the earth or grown and then shipped off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### The Need for Domestic Processing Capacity

The industrial plant that the rest of the world will need to build to replace [[Chinas economic dependency on exports | China's]] manufacturing capacity should, in part, be established in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. However, the ideal time to have started this development was arguably 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Australia is significantly behind in this regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

Only in the last year, with the United States' Inflation Reduction Act, have Australians negotiated to join the subsidies regime, allowing some American funding to help build industrial processing plants in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This kind of development should have occurred decades ago across every product set Australia produces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

When processing capacity, currently concentrated in [[Chinas economic dependency on exports | China]], goes offline, even if there is demand for raw commodities elsewhere, other locations will need to build their processing capacity first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This means the adjustment for Australia in a post-[[Chinas economic dependency on exports | China]] environment will be more severe than it needs to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## Resilience Through Alliance

Despite the significant economic challenges, Australia's strong [[Australias strategic alliance with the United States | strategic alliance with the United States]] is a major asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Australia has consistently been a creative and capable ally, forming international coalitions to unofficially achieve American policy goals, participating in conflicts from Korea to Iraq and Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. This long-standing friendship is why Australia is one of the very few countries to have a free trade agreement with the [[Impact of the Shale Revolution on US industry | United States]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

In a "post-American world," where the [[Impact of the Shale Revolution on US industry | U.S.]] selectively maintains alliances, Australia is at the very top of the list of preferred partners, even above Japan, Singapore, Canada, and Great Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. This enduring alliance means that even with a potentially severe economic adjustment, rooted in a free trade relationship with the [[Impact of the Shale Revolution on US industry | United States]], Australia is expected to recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Australia possesses resources the world needs, and its creative and capable nature will allow it to restructure its economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. The key question is whether Australia will begin this restructuring before its economic challenges fully manifest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

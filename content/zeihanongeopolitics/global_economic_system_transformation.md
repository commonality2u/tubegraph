The global economic system is currently undergoing a significant transformation, moving away from the consensus established after World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. This shift is driven by a combination of changing American foreign policy and evolving global demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:03">[04:00:03]</a>.

## The Post-WWII Global Consensus

The [[postcold_war_global_economic_system | Post-Cold War global economic system]] (which emerged from the post-World War II global consensus) was founded on a specific agreement: the United States would provide security and open its markets globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. In return, other nations would align with the U.S. during the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. This system facilitated:
*   **Security:** Americans managed global security, ensuring safe seas for commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   **Open Markets:** The U.S. opened its markets, benefiting global trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.
*   **Alliances:** This arrangement formed the basis for alliances with countries like Taiwan, Korea, Japan, and NATO members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.
*   **Economic Growth:** It created the economic and security environment that enabled the rise of countries like China, which was a U.S. ally during the late Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

## Reasons for System Breakdown

This established global system is now "breaking down" due to two primary factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>:

### American Disengagement
The United States is no longer willing or able to bear the costs associated with maintaining the previous global order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>:
*   **Financial Burden:** Americans are tired of paying the economic price to keep the world open, as it has placed other nations at an advantage over American workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. This sentiment resonates strongly in the current populist era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.
*   **Naval Restructuring:** The U.S. Navy has been refashioned from hundreds of patrol ships to fewer clusters of ships designed for warfare, reducing its global coverage capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

### Global Demographic Shifts
Urbanization and industrialization over seven decades have led to declining birth rates worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. This has resulted in a global workforce shortage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>:
*   **Aging Populations:** Countries are increasingly running out of workers in their 50s and 60s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.
*   **Workforce Decline:** The 2020s were anticipated as the decade when many countries would lose the workforce capacity to support the [[future_of_global_trade_and_regionalization_trends | globalized system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.
*   **Impact on Trade:** A decline in consumption directly impacts trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. These [[global_demographic_shifts_and_future_economic_implications | global demographic shifts]] are a key driver of the economic changes.

## Consequences of Transformation

The breakdown of the global economic system, coupled with American political shifts, leads to significant changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>:

### Economic Restructuring
The world's economic network is "collapsing and reforming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. This period of [[global_economic_restructuring_and_its_impacts | global economic restructuring]] implies fundamental shifts in:
*   How people live and work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   Who businesses service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.
*   Sources for goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.
This is a period of [[economic_restructuring_in_post_globalized_world | Economic restructuring in post-globalized world]]. The [[challenges_facing_globalization | fall of hyper globalization]] further contributes to these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

### Increased Volatility and Violence
Periods of significant change tend to generate fear and anger, particularly among those with vested interests in the old system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. This can manifest as:
*   **Inter-state conflicts:** A series of military conflicts at the state level are anticipated, with the conflict in Ukraine being an example. Another conflict in China is also considered likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.
*   **Domestic political violence:** In the United States, such periods of political change have historically led to domestic political violence, seen during the Great Depression (1930s), Reconstruction, and the Civil War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>.

The transformation of global economic systems and political structures is inherently stressful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. While the overall process may ultimately be a net gain for countries like the United States, navigating this shift from a familiar past to an unknown future will generate significant stresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>. The recent assassination attempt on Donald Trump is cited as an example of the kind of violence that can emerge during such periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

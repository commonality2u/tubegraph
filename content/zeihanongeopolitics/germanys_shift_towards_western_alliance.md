Initially, there was concern that [[Germany's economic role and future within the EU | Germany]], facing pressure from [[germanys_trade_relationship_with_russia_and_china | China]], the United States, [[germanys_trade_relationship_with_russia_and_china | Russia]], energy issues, and [[demographic_challenges_facing_germany | demographics]], might "lash out" to secure resources via military means, although this concern has since lessened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>.

## The Nord Stream Ultimatum

A significant event occurred early in the Ukraine War when [[germanys_trade_relationship_with_russia_and_china | Russia]] shut down the Nord Stream pipeline on September 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>. This pipeline was the primary source of natural gas for [[Germany's economic role and future within the EU | Germany]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.

[[germanys_trade_relationship_with_russia_and_china | Russia]] issued a public ultimatum to [[Germany's economic role and future within the EU | Germany]], stating they would not restart the pipeline unless [[Germany's economic role and future within the EU | Germany]] changed its stance on Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>. The choice presented was stark:
> "Either you stab Ukraine in the back and make sure [[postworld_war_ii_european_security_order | NATO]] can't function in which case you could have your energy again, or we're going to leave this off and you're going to [[germanys_industrial_decline | de-industrialize]]. You'll no longer be modern. So you can be Western or you can be modern, you can't be both." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>

### Germany's Choice

Against expectations, especially given its history of siding with [[germanys_trade_relationship_with_russia_and_china | Russia]] on energy and [[Germanys evolving role in European security | security]] issues for the past 30 years, [[Germany's economic role and future within the EU | Germany]] chose to remain "Western" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>. This meant accepting the energy crisis rather than caving to [[germanys_trade_relationship_with_russia_and_china | Russia]]'s demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.

> "The Germans chose to be Western, they chose the energy crisis rather than give in and after the last 30 years of siding with the [[germanys_trade_relationship_with_russia_and_china | Russians]] on every energy and [[Germanys evolving role in European security | security]] issue that mattered, that was a big deal. That was not expected certainly not by me and I don't think that Germans get enough credit for that." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>

This decision indicates that, when faced with a critical choice, [[Germany's economic role and future within the EU | Germany]] may prioritize morals and ethics over convenience and economic wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>.

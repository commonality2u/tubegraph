Recent weeks, specifically through July, August, and September, have seen an "atrocious" flow of information regarding China's economic and political health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This has led to a widespread realization that the country is experiencing a broad-scale societal, economic, and political breakdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Shifting Global Perception

For years, the narrative from Beijing, and often from political parties globally, was one of a "rising China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The sudden and complete inversion of this perception has come as a shock to many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. However, the speaker posits that these issues have been ongoing for years, but are only now becoming widely noticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Delayed Awareness Due to Global Preoccupations

One primary reason for the delayed global awareness of China's issues is that other nations have been preoccupied with their own significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>:
*   The Ukraine war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   Iranian geopolitical activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   Four years of the Trump Administration followed by two years of a more internally focused Biden Administration in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   The tail end of the European financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   Japan's preoccupation with its remilitarization program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

It is only now that the "noise" from China has become so loud that its negative news is undeniable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Internal Factors Affecting External Perception

### The Impact of COVID-19
For three years, the COVID-19 pandemic provided a convenient explanation for any negative statistical releases or news from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Problems like declining consumption, supply chain disruptions, and issues linking industrial production to global needs were all attributed to COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. This obscured underlying systemic issues, and it is only now, post-COVID-19, that the world is getting a clearer look at China's true state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### [[chinas_political_system_and_public_opinion_control | Political Purges and Data Suppression]]
[[chinas_political_system_and_public_opinion_control | Chairman Xi's purges]], conducted under the guise of an anti-corruption campaign, have significantly impacted China's internal data and information flow, which in turn affects external perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>:
*   Regional power centers were removed to prevent them from rising to national prominence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   Factions of previous presidents, Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, were "gutted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   Bureaucrats and the private sector have been purged of anyone who might rise to national prominence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   Certain data collection methods have been removed to prevent individuals from using economic or political routes to prominence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. For example, college dissertation information is no longer published or collected, and political biographies are no longer compiled by the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

This has created an "information vacuum" across the Chinese space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### Demographic Shifts
The [[demographic_challenges_facing_china | demographic collapse]] within China is now evident and considered uncorrectable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   The birth rate in China has dropped by nearly 70% since 2017, the fastest drop in recorded human history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   The Shanghai Academy of Sciences suggests China has overcounted its population by over 100 million people, primarily working-age individuals under 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   China has likely hit its peak workforce years earlier, and there are not enough Millennials to sustain consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   The cost of the workforce has increased by a factor of 14 or 15 in the last 22 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

These internal demographic realities, combined with the lack of macroeconomic structures to encourage family growth, mean China's system is breaking down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Geopolitical and Economic External Pressures

China is facing mounting external pressures:
*   **Sanctions Risk:** The Ukraine war has increased the likelihood of China coming into the crosshairs of sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   **Supply Line Vulnerability:** China is increasingly exposed to energy and food insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Infrastructure between Russia and China is thin, forcing goods to travel extensive, exposed supply lines around Africa, India, and Vietnam, making them the "most exposed supply lines in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Protectionist Policies:** The current Biden Administration in the United States is considered the "most protectionist" in a century, even more so than the Trump administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. This [[impact_of_us_policy_shift_on_china | US policy shift on China]] further restricts China's ability to export.

## Looming Collapse and Global Impact

While China's decline has been ongoing, its rapidity has accelerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. The severe information vacuum within China and the collapsed decision-making capacity of its leadership make it uncertain if Chairman Xi can even become aware of the issues in time, let alone formulate coherent policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

This situation presents a significant risk to the global economy. Industrial demand for products like transmission towers, transformers, and other industrial equipment, still largely made in China, could be severely disrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Waitlists for some of these products are already over 36 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. The concern is that the world might not realize China is "broken" until product shipments simply stop arriving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. This [[chinas_potential_collapse_and_its_impact_on_global_industry | potential collapse and its impact on global industry]] could lead to significant damage globally due to shortages if industrial capacity outside of China is not built out fast enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

Many have questioned if India will become the next China due to its large population and faster growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. However, this comparison receives a "resounding no," which Indians should appreciate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. China's success has been fundamentally tied to specific international strategic conditions that India has not replicated.

## Impact of US Strategic Largesse

China's economic ascent relied on three key factors, the first being the [[shift_in_us_global_strategic_role | strategic largesse]] of the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The US created a globalized system that allowed the worldwide import and export of goods without the need to militarily secure territory or sea lanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This system resulted from the American globalization push after World War II and particularly from Nixon's visit to Mao, which engineered the Sino-Soviet split and made China an ally of the United States during the later Cold War years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This strategic shift enabled China to become a manufacturing powerhouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

However, the United States has since lost interest in this arrangement and now views China as a rival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The continued existence of China's economic model is dependent on the ongoing [[shift_in_us_global_strategic_role | strategic largesse]] of the US, a plan deemed "very bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The US is actively withdrawing its support, affecting sectors like agriculture, energy, and especially semiconductors, and could potentially halt these flows overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### India's Different Path

In contrast, [[indias_international_relations_and_foreign_policy | India]] never fully integrated into this US-led system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. During the Cold War, [[indias_international_relations_and_foreign_policy | India]] was pro-Soviet, and even after the Soviet system collapsed, it has reflexively maintained a degree of pro-Russian sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This means [[indias_international_relations_and_foreign_policy | India's]] economy never internationalized in the same way China's did, missing out on the rapid growth seen in China from the 1980s to 2010s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. However, this also implies that when the globalized system faces disruptions, [[indias_international_relations_and_foreign_policy | India]] suffers less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Geographic and Resource Relationships

[[indias_international_relations_and_foreign_policy | India]] possesses geographic advantages that China does not, being closer to essential resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. [[australias_strategic_alliance_with_the_united_states | Australia]] is significantly more friendly to [[indias_international_relations_and_foreign_policy | India]] than to China, ensuring an additional supply of food or minerals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Furthermore, the Indian subcontinent is the first stop after the Persian Gulf, making [[indias_international_relations_and_foreign_policy | India]] one of the last countries expected to experience an energy crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. China, in contrast, is at the end of a long and easily disruptible supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

Despite internal issues such as inefficiency, women's rights, the presence of Pakistan, and corruption, these problems for [[indias_international_relations_and_foreign_policy | India]] are considered an "order of magnitude less" severe than those currently facing China, and are deemed survivable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

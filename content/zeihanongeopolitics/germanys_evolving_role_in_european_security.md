Germany is undergoing a significant shift in its approach to European security, moving away from its post-World War II status as a "security consumer" towards developing its own military capabilities and strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This transformation has profound implications for the [[postworld_war_ii_european_security_order | European security order]] and the [[european_unions_changing_dynamics | dynamics of the European Union]].

## Permanent Deployment to Lithuania

A notable development is Germany's decision to make a permanent military deployment of roughly 5,000 troops to Lithuania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This is not a United Nations mission or a rotating program, but a permanent deployment as part of Germany's NATO commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Historical Context

For the past 75 years since World War II, the global community has deliberately worked to ensure Germany does not possess a deployment-capable military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Germany has been deeply embedded within the NATO system, with the United States largely underwriting its physical security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This arrangement, while a financial drain on the U.S. and allies, has been crucial given Germany's broadly indefensible borders and historical tensions with surrounding countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The U.S. "forcibly Rewritten" the rules of [[postworld_war_ii_european_security_order | European security]], helping to keep Europe united and at peace for 75 years, especially in the post-Cold War era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. A key component of this order was Germany's agreement to avoid expressing opinions on security matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Implications of the Shift

The recent deployment signifies the "rehabilitation of Germany as a more normal country" that includes military tactics and strategies in its toolkit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. As a result, Germany will begin to assert its own opinions on security issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

In the short term, this is largely viewed as beneficial for the [[european_unions_response_to_current_geopolitical_challenges | European Alliance]], particularly concerning shared concerns about Russia and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. However, there is a historical precedent where German rearmament following periods of disarmament has led to significant conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Impact on Regional Powers

### Poland
Poland is particularly affected by this development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Poland is currently engaged in a massive rearmament program designed to prevent future subjugation by Germany or Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This program was partly based on the assumption that Germany would not develop offensive military capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. As Germany's military role evolves, Poland will need to pay more attention to its western border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Even though the German deployment in Lithuania requires cooperation with the Polish government, any Polish political faction will likely feel apprehensive due to historical context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Russia
The emergence of Germany as an active military power is arguably Russia's "worst nightmare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Both the Soviet and post-Soviet Russian systems benefited from the United States overseeing regional security in Europe, preventing countries like Sweden, Finland, Germany, or France from acting independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. As long as Russia maintained a relationship with Washington, regional security was managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

The Ukraine war, while bringing the alliance closer, has compelled many [[emerging_regional_powers_in_europe | regional powers]] to take security matters into their own hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. While NATO members are generally aligned against Russia, individual nations are increasingly taking independent actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. The fact that [[germanys_economic_role_and_future_within_the_eu | Germany]], Europe's largest economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, is now developing military capabilities to act independently poses a significant long-term challenge to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Historically, Germany has been Russia's most formidable opponent in the modern era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

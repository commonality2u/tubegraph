Turkey has long been a significant global power, with its origins tracing back to the 1200s when the Turks diverged from Mongol hordes and settled in Istanbul (formerly Constantinople) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Since then, Turkey has been an integral part of Middle Eastern and European politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Historical Context

After their decisive defeat at the end of World War I, Turkey's political and economic orders were shattered, leading them to withdraw from significant international engagement for most of the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The disintegration of the Sublime Porte in Istanbul a century ago left lasting scars on the region, with many problems in the southern Balkans, Levant, and Mesopotamia linked to this collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. It is only in recent decades, with the rise of President Erdoğan, that Turkey has begun to re-emerge, rediscovering a world more complex than remembered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Geopolitical Significance

A primary reason for Turkey's importance is its strategic location. Istanbul, situated on the Golden Horn and the Turkish Straits, provides the sole water access between the Mediterranean, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans on one side, and the Black Sea (connecting to navigable rivers like the Don, Dnieper, and Dniester leading deep into Ukraine and Russia) on the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. A canal now links the Don to the Volga, extending water access all the way to Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

By land, Turkey's Anatolian plateau connects east to Persia, India, and China, and northwest through the Balkans into Europe via routes like the Danube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. In any era without [[impact_of_american_politics_on_globalization | global trade]] facilitated by open seas, Istanbul would arguably be the richest and most strategically important city on the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

However, during the last 70 years, under the [[impact_of_american_politics_on_globalization | American-created global order]], Turkey's advantageous geography became less significant as the Americans made global seas safe for all, allowing commerce from any body of water to reach anywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the pre-globalized era, where naval powers jealously guarded their commerce and attacked others' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. As the United States gradually withdraws its guardianship from international waterways, Turkey's [[geopolitical_significance_of_turkeys_location | geopolitical significance of Turkeys location]] is incrementally increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## Re-emerging Influence and Strategic Choices

As Turkey re-expands its influence into former imperial territories, it finds that many regions have developed their own, often less competent or powerful, opinions on governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. With the possible exception of Iran, there is no country within Turkey's "arms reach" that can meaningfully stand up to it economically, politically, or militarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This presents Turkey with a wide array of options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

However, Turkey lacks the power to pursue all options simultaneously, forcing it to make strategic choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This forms the core of [[turkeys_strategic_options_post_american_global_order | Turkeys strategic options post American global order]].

### Strategic Options

Turkey's current strategic opportunities, moving clockwise from the north, include:

*   **North (Ukraine/Russia)**: Turkey has a historical advantage against the Russian Empire by controlling river mouths and naval forces in the Black Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. While politically and economically on the fence in the Ukraine war, Turkey strategically supports Ukraine by providing drones, understanding that a Russian defeat would primarily benefit Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Northeast (Caucasus)**: This region, often a "graveyard for empires," still offers opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Azerbaijan, an ethnically Turkic oil producer (kicking out about a million barrels a day), pipes oil through the Caucasus to Turkey, either to the port of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean or via the Black Sea, requiring passage through Istanbul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Azerbaijan has historically allied with Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. The recent destruction of the Armenian military by Azerbaijan raises questions about Armenia's future, with Turkey positioned as a potential broker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **East (Iran)**: Moving east, Turkey encounters "Iranian Azerbaijan," an ethnic group kin to Turkey, which makes Iran nervous about an independent Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. A conflict with Iran would pit Turkey's well-trained military against Iran's infantry in mountainous terrain, a serious but potentially winnable commitment for Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Southeast (Mesopotamia)**: This region is home to Kurds, a minority group spanning Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. It offers oil, gas, wheat, and access to the Persian Gulf, which is the world's largest free energy market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Control here would allow Turkey to become a broker in global energy markets as American protection wanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **South (Levant/Israel)**: Turkey and [[israels_potential_alliances_with_turkey_and_saudi_arabia | Israel]] were close allies during the first half of the Cold War until the Iranian shift in 1979 and later until Erdoğan's rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. Erdoğan's current dislike for Israel stems from a desire to re-establish Turkey as a religious leader in the region, seeing the perceived oppression of Palestinian Muslims by Western European Jews as a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. While a direct conflict would require Turkey to invade Syria and Lebanon first, a less messy cooperation between Turkey and [[israels_potential_alliances_with_turkey_and_saudi_arabia | Israel]] could keep other powers out of the region and allow them to project power into Egypt to control the Suez Canal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   **Southwest (Eastern Mediterranean)**: This area, including Cyprus and Greece, offers little economic gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. However, it is the first stop past Istanbul to the wider world via this vector, necessitating some form of Turkish understanding or occupation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Relations between Turks and Greeks are strained, and between Turks and Cypriots, they are hostile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Engaging in this mountainous, naval-heavy region could also draw in other naval powers like France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
*   **Northwest (Southern Balkans)**: Specifically, the Southeastern Balkans (Romania and Bulgaria) offer the lowlands of the Danube system, punching into Northern Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. These countries, with more sophisticated ethnicities than other border nations, present opportunities for general economic activity, energy reserves, and food supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Blocked from the rest of Europe by the Carpathian and Balkan mountains, they are naturally within Turkey's sphere of influence and easier to defend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## Conclusion: Difficult Choices

The speaker suggests that the two most straightforward strategic choices for Turkey are:
1.  **The Balkan Vector**: Cultivating existing warm-to-cool relationships with Bulgaria and Romania. These countries see Turkey as a relatively reliable economic and security partner, especially as the United States' interest in the region wanes, leaving Russia as the only other significant option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
2.  **A Deal with Israel**: Cooperating with [[israels_potential_alliances_with_turkey_and_saudi_arabia | Israel]] would allow Turkey to bypass Greece, bring Suez into its sphere of influence, and make it harder for Western Mediterranean naval powers like Britain or France to penetrate the Eastern Mediterranean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

Turkey faces an "embarrassment of opportunities" and significant strength, but not enough to seize every possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. History demands selectivity, and Turkey is no exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

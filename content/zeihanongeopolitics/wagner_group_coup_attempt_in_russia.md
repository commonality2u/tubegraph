An armed movement described as a coup attempt unfolded in Russia over the course of June 23rd, 24th, and 25th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This event involved the [[wagner_group_and_its_role_in_russian_military_operations | Wagner paramilitary group]], led by [[the_death_of_wagner_group_leader_yevgeny_prigozhin | Yevgeny Prigozhin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The [[wagner_group_and_its_role_in_russian_military_operations | Wagner Group]] had previously served as an unofficial arm of the [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russian military]] for several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Key Events
*   **Movement into Russia** [[the_death_of_wagner_group_leader_yevgeny_prigozhin | Prigozhin]]'s troops left their positions in Ukraine and advanced into Russia proper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Capture of Rostov-on-Don** They captured the city of Rostov-on-Don, which has a population of approximately 1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Rostov-on-Don is the primary logistical and communications hub for the [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russian military]] in the entire Ukrainian War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Attempt to Flip Troops** [[wagner_group_and_its_role_in_russian_military_operations | Wagner]] forces attempted to persuade [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russian troops]] to join their side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Putin's Response** [[implications_of_the_coup_attempt_on_putins_leadership_and_russian_military_strategy | Vladimir Putin]] declared [[the_death_of_wagner_group_leader_yevgeny_prigozhin | Prigozhin]] a traitor and called upon the military and security services to crush the rebellion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   **Prigozhin's Stance** [[the_death_of_wagner_group_leader_yevgeny_prigozhin | Prigozhin]] stated that the president was "misinformed" and suggested that "we're going to have a new president soon anyway" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Impact on the Ukraine War
The capture of Rostov-on-Don by [[wagner_group_and_its_role_in_russian_military_operations | Wagner]] forces had immediate implications for the ongoing conflict in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Logistical Disruption** With Rostov-on-Don offline, it became impossible for [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russian forces]] in Crimea or occupied Ukraine to receive reinforcements, new troops, equipment, or fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   **Opportunity for Ukraine** This situation presented a "golden opportunity" for the Ukrainians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Prior to the coup attempt, the Ukrainian counter-offensive had not been progressing particularly well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, with Ukrainian forces often bogged down in attritional fighting and struggling to breach [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russian]] defensive lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
    *   **Pre-Coup Changes** On June 23rd, Ukraine shifted its military strategy, targeting ammo dumps instead of command and control bunkers, which is typical before a major offensive push <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The Chonhar bridge in Crimea, vital for [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russian]] rail supply, was also rendered impassable for weeks due to missile strikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. These actions created a window where [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russian]] forces in the western half of the front could not function effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
    *   **Combined Impact** The disruption of supply lines due to the [[wagner_group_and_its_role_in_russian_military_operations | Wagner]] takeover of Rostov-on-Don, combined with previous Ukrainian attacks on critical infrastructure like the Chonhar bridge, left [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russian]] troops west of Mariupol effectively cut off from supplies from Russia proper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. This made them vulnerable and unable to receive reinforcements, fuel, or artillery shells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   **Uncertainty of Fighting** Despite numerous reports, there was no sign of direct, large-scale fighting between [[wagner_group_and_its_role_in_russian_military_operations | Wagner]] forces and [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russian]] forces during the initial phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. However, [[wagner_group_and_its_role_in_russian_military_operations | Wagner]] forces were in control of the logistical train crucial for the entire [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russian army]] in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

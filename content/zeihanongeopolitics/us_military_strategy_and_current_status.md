The United States has not engaged in a major conflict on the scale of World War II since that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Subsequent conflicts have primarily served two purposes: supporting the global order by aiding allies, as seen in Korea and Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, or attempting to establish a new world order following the Cold War, exemplified by Desert Shield and Desert Storm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Conditions for Major US Military Re-engagement

For the US to become directly involved in a major conflict, two primary conditions could lead to such an outcome:
1.  **Political Leadership:** The emergence of a US political leader who views international issues as a foundational element for forging a new national identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Currently, there is no indication of this across the political spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
2.  **Provocation:** A nation or entity undertaking "breathtakingly stupid and provoking" actions against the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Historical examples of such provocations include Pearl Harbor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, the Cuban Missile Crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, Sputnik <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, and the invasion of Kuwait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### Assessment of Major Global Powers

*   **China:** It is unlikely that China would provoke the US into a direct conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Chinese leadership recognizes that any conflict with the US would primarily occur on water, which would severely disrupt China's economic model, including critical food and energy imports reliant on the freedom of the seas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Such a conflict would be considered "suicide" for China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Russia:** Russia is considered the only country currently where a major issue leading to US involvement might arise, primarily due to "Russian incompetence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Over the past three years, it has become apparent that Russia does not possess a "classic Army," but rather a "mob" armed and directed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. While this strategy has historically led to Russia winning roughly half of its wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, a direct clash with the US would only occur if the conflict reached a point where it directly threatened US interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

The [[US military strategy in the Ukraine war | US military strategy in the Ukraine war]] has focused on passive interest in NATO, implying that a direct fight would ensue if Ukraine were to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. However, despite current [[Ukrainian military strategy and offensive preparations | Russian gains]], the US is not yet in a direct fight, and continued Russian advances for the next five years are not expected to change this immediate stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Current Status of the US Military

The US military has "rested and recuited" from the War on Terror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. It is currently not heavily engaged in "occupations" or "hot deployments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. If a direct attack were to occur on the United States, the response would be severe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

### Domestic Strategic Concerns

While most US conflicts have been outside North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, the only current domestic issue where military involvement could theoretically arise is in dealing with drug cartels in Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

*   **Mexico and Drug Cartels:** American demand for cocaine has significantly eroded the rule of law in large parts of Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Combined with the perceived incompetence of the AMLO administration, Mexico's public safety, public health, and infrastructure have deteriorated over the past five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
    *   **Military Solution Feasibility:** Any notion that the US can unilaterally impose a military solution on the cartel situation is considered unrealistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Mexico is vast, and the cartel issue is far more complex than anything faced in Pakistan or Afghanistan during the War on Terror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
    *   **Required Collaboration:** A successful military approach would necessitate "hand in glove" collaboration with the Mexican administration, similar to what was done with Colombia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. However, the current Mexican administration is not considering such cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
    *   **Consequences of Unilateral Action:** If the US were to attempt a military solution without active Mexican participation, it would jeopardize the trade relationship, potentially leading to a severe US economic depression as crucial economic, human migration, manufacturing, and energy ties simultaneously break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

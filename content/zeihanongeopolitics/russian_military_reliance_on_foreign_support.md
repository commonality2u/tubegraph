Recent reports indicate a significant and increasing reliance by [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russia]] on foreign military support, particularly from North Korea and Iran, to sustain its war efforts. This dependence highlights [[russian_military_challenges_and_recruitment_issues | Russian military challenges and recruitment issues]] and has broader geopolitical implications for countries like South Korea and Israel.

## North Korean Military Aid

Reports suggest North Korean troops are in the process of deploying to [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russia]], with technical advisors already assisting [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russians]] on how to use North Korean weaponry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. There is open discussion in South Korea about a potential troop deployment for frontline combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

North Korea is reportedly providing ballistic missiles and artillery shells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. It's estimated that roughly half of the artillery shells used by [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russians]] in Ukraine this year are from North Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. However, the quality of these North Korean munitions is poor; approximately half may not work, and they have reportedly caused more explosions of [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russian]] artillery tubes than Ukrainian ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

## Iranian Military Aid

Iran is also contributing to [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russia]]'s military efforts by supplying Shahed drones, with over a thousand having been used to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. The reliance on countries like North Korea and Iran, which are not considered technological leaders, points to significant shortcomings within [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russia]]'s own military-industrial complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.

## Implications of Foreign Dependence

The substantial [[dependence_on_foreign_support_for_russian_military_operations | dependence on foreign support for Russian military operations]] for basic war materials like artillery shells and drones suggests a dire outlook for [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russia]]'s ability to sustain the war long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russia]] is only capable of producing a double-digit number of new tanks per year, mostly refurbishing old ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. This points to a future where [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russia]] may become entirely dependent on weapon imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.

This reliance on foreign suppliers creates new [[russian_defensive_positions_and_supply_challenges | vulnerabilities]] for the [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russian]] war machine. If manufacturing facilities for these weapons are located in countries like Iran (e.g., Isfahan), they become accessible targets for other nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.

## Broader Geopolitical Consequences

The involvement of North Korea and Iran has inadvertently drawn South Korea and Israel into the conflict. These countries had previously tried to avoid significant involvement in the Ukraine war due to their own regional security concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. However, [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russia]]'s engagement with their adversaries has now "stirred the pot" in their respective backyards, leading to a loosening of political restrictions in Jerusalem and Seoul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.

*   **South Korea**: As one of the world's top five arms exporters, South Korea produces artillery, rocket systems, and tanks comparable to Western designs but at a lower price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. Increased South Korean support for Ukraine is now more likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.
*   **Israel**: A world leader in anti-missile technologies, particularly the Iron Dome system for anti-artillery and anti-rocket defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.

Cooperation between South Korea and Israel, leveraging Israel's technical expertise in specific weapon systems and South Korea's mass production capabilities, could significantly alter the strategic balance within the Western Alliance system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russia]]'s decision to rely on North Korea is seen by some as a "dumbest thing" they could do, as it risks bringing powerful new players like South Korea and Israel into opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>.

The United States' political system is currently undergoing significant changes, with parties and factions shifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[00:36:12]</a>. This period of [[political_realignment_in_the_united_states | rearrangement]] is the seventh in US history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>. When America's political priorities are re-evaluated, the country tends to move in a new direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>.

## Current State of Alliances

In the post-Cold War era, the number of US allies has decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>. According to Peter Zeihan, if not for the Ukraine war, the US might have largely "ditched the Europeans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>.

The definition of a firm, trusted ally involves being able to share "deepest, darkest secrets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>. Based on this, the US has very few such allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>:
*   Australia (for non-sensitive matters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>
*   New Zealand (for non-sensitive matters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>
*   Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>
*   The United Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>
*   Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>
*   Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>

Other nations, such as India, Germany, and France, are not considered full allies under this strict definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. Mexico, despite its close ties, is viewed as a "friend" or "family" rather than an "ally," due to past issues that resulted in the loss of DEA agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:23">[00:35:23]</a>.

## Political System and Policy Implications

The current [[political_volatility_and_realignment_in_the_united_states | political realignment]] is impacting policy priorities:
*   Unions and the business community are no longer central to the political conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>.
*   This makes business-focused relationships, such as that with Mexico, awkward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a>.
*   Other issues, not traditionally led by trade representatives or presidents, are now dominating discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>.
*   These include the green transition, migration, border security, and concerns about fentanyl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>.

## The 2024 Political Landscape

Donald Trump's impact on the American political scene, particularly during this period of reshuffling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>, is characterized by several shifts in coalition dynamics:
*   He attracted a significant portion of Hispanic Americans, particularly Cubans, into the Republican coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>.
*   He broke unions out of the Democratic coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:56">[00:37:56]</a>.
*   Conversely, he alienated business voters, fiscal conservatives, National Security voters, and Law and Order voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>.

Trump's core support lies with social conservatives, a powerful but numerically insufficient base to win elections on a broader scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>. This necessitates winning over independent voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:24">[00:38:24]</a>.

### Independent Voters and the Republican Party's Future

In recent midterms, a notable shift occurred where over 80% of American independents, who typically don't show up for midterms, expressed strong dissatisfaction with the Biden administration's economic policies and regretted their previous votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>. Despite this, they still voted for Democrats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>.

Trump's stance is that the general election should not matter, which is the only arena where American independents traditionally have a voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:08">[00:39:08]</a>. As a result of alienating core conservatives and making it impossible for independents to vote for him, the Republican party is predicted not to survive the next general election and will likely break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>. Trump is anticipated to face what could be the second-worst defeat for a presidential candidate in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a>.

The Federal Reserve's current monetary policy, particularly its stance on interest rates, suggests a significant shift in its view of Wall Street and the broader financial sector's role in the U.S. economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Contrary to expectations on Wall Street for multiple rate cuts, the Fed has maintained higher rates, indicating a different perspective on economic priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Federal Reserve's Perspective on Wall Street

The Federal Reserve harbors a degree of resentment towards Wall Street, viewing it as having been irresponsible with large capital inflows in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The Fed attributes responsibility to Wall Street for past financial crises, such as the dot-com crash and the subprime crash, which each required a decade to rebuild the financial sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

From the Fed's viewpoint, what "has to happen" for Wall Street's business plans does not necessarily align with the needs of the overall United States economy or the "real economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This divergence suggests a "rye revenge" at play, where the Federal Reserve opts for actions independent of Wall Street's desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Demographic Impact on Capital Availability and the Financial Sector

A significant independent reason for the Federal Reserve's current stance is global demographic shifts, particularly concerning the Baby Boomer generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### The Baby Boomer Era (2000-2020)
Individuals aged 45 to 65 are typically the most "capital rich" due to kids moving out, mortgages being paid down, high income, and saving for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. The Baby Boomers, the largest generation in human history globally, largely fell into this capital-rich period from roughly 2000 to 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

This period saw:
*   The highest capital availability on both American and global bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   The lowest capital costs ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   The rise of an entire financial class, including Wall Street, to metabolize and send abroad the vast amounts of capital that the United States alone could not absorb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   China also experienced a similar period from 2000 to 2020, with its economy firing on all cylinders, though its capital generation relied more on monetization (currency printing) than private savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

This era fostered a perception that the financial sector and its professionals were "necessary" to manage the "bottomless wave" of capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### The Post-Boomer Landscape
The vast majority of Baby Boomers have now retired, and the rest will exit the capital-generating system within the next five to six years, leading to a significant reduction in available capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Their savings are converting into low-velocity investments like T-bills and cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

*   **Generation X (Gen X)** is a smaller generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
*   **Millennials**, the next large generation, are not expected to enter their capital-rich period for another 10 to 12 years, and historically, they have tended to reach life milestones later than previous generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

The net effect is a significant reduction in "free Capital" available in the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## A New Model for the Financial Sector

With less capital available, the need for a large financial sector is diminishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. The Federal Reserve recognizes that "there's less Capital, demand is falling" and that its tools, designed to regulate capital and demand, necessitate a new model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

Under this new model, the financial sector is no longer viewed as "all knowing, all seeing, and omnipresent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

## Implications for Interest Rates and the Economy

The Federal Reserve remains concerned about inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Additionally, in a period of deglobalization, there's a skyrocketing demand for American employment, capital, and materials as the U.S. rapidly disentangles from global supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. This requires building significant new industrial plant, which is expensive and inflationary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

Consequently, interest rates are unlikely to drop and may even increase for the next two to five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The prevailing expectation is "higher for longer," meaning capital costs will remain elevated for approximately another decade until new large capital-generating generations reach their 50s and the industrial plant is built out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Capital available today, despite being four times more expensive than five years ago, is still the cheapest it will be until the mid-2030s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

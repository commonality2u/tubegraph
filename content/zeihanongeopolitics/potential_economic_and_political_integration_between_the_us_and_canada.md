Former President Donald Trump has expressed a willingness to use [[economic_coercion_and_uscanada_relations | economic coercion]] against [[canadas_relationship_with_the_united_states | Canada]], but not military force, to achieve his objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Economic Integration

[[canadas_economic_and_trade_relations_with_the_united_states | Canada]] is described as "not a normal country" economically, with approximately 90% of its population clustered along the southern border with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. This proximity has led to significant economic ties:
*   **North-South Trade**: All mainland Canadian provinces, from British Columbia to Nova Scotia, engage in more trade with the United States than they do with each other (East-West) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Shared Economic Space**: Because of this integration, Canadian provinces are considered part of the "American economic space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Trade Deficits**: Attempts to "break the trade deficit" with [[canadas_economic_and_trade_relations_with_the_united_states | Canada]] are viewed as counterproductive, effectively "breaking internal United States trade" due to the deeply intertwined economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   **Trading Partner**: [[canadas_economic_and_trade_relations_with_the_united_states | Canada]] is the second-largest trading partner for the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. Using blackmail or threats against such a partner for financial commitments would be "bad math" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

## Demographic Considerations for Political Integration

A potential merger between [[canadas_relationship_with_the_united_states | Canada]] and the United States would involve significant demographic challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. While the US currently has a relatively stable demographic structure (described as a "chimney stage"), [[comparison_of_us_and_canadian_demographics | Canada]] exhibits a more inverted or "open pyramid" structure, indicating an aging population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

Key demographic points by province:
*   **Saskatchewan and Alberta**: These Prairie Provinces have a demographic structure more akin to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Quebec**: This province is described as "full-on inverted" demographically and is experiencing a decline in its workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Labrador, Prince Edward Island (PEI), Nova Scotia**: These provinces are in an even worse demographic position than Quebec, though they represent less than 10% of the Canadian population combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   **Ontario**: The largest province economically and demographically, Ontario is rapidly aging towards a Quebec-style inversion and is projected to become another significant financial burden within one to two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Cost of Integration
> If [[canadas_relationship_with_the_united_states | Canada]] were to become states within the US, absorbing its 35 million people and their social welfare model would be "really expensive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Integrating provinces like Quebec, which would be the oldest of the new states, into American social security, Medicare, and Medicaid systems could add an estimated $500 billion to $1 trillion to the US federal budget just to maintain these aging populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

A more plausible scenario for integration, if it were to occur, might involve individual Canadian provinces like Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Alberta choosing to join the US for economic reasons, to avoid funding the retirements of other provinces like Quebec and Ontario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

## Ally and Security Partnership

[[canadas_relationship_with_the_united_states | Canada]] is considered a crucial ally and family to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
*   **Security Cooperation**: In matters of security, particularly missile defense over the pole, [[canadas_relationship_with_the_united_states | Canada]] has consistently been very cooperative with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **NATO Spending**: While minor disagreements exist (e.g., NATO spending), these are not considered significant disputes within the security sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Conclusion
> Closer economic integration with [[canadas_economic_and_trade_relations_with_the_united_states | Canada]] and the United States is seen as a beneficial idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. However, using [[economic_coercion_and_uscanada_relations | economic coercion]] against a key ally and major trading partner is not recommended due to the high costs and potential damage to the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Such discussions are hoped to be "bluster and threats" rather than serious policy intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

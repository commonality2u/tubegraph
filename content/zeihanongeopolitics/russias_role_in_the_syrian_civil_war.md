Russia has been the primary reason Syria has endured as a state for an extended period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Historical Context of Syria
Syria is considered an artificial construct, with its territory lacking a functional government for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The modern state of Syria emerged after World War I during the Mandate period, when colonies were broken up and independent states formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Neighbouring regions like Mesopotamia (Iraq), Saudi Arabia, and Egypt took desirable territories, leaving Syria as a "rump" state, primarily what remained after Turkey took the Hatay region (the only area with reliable rainfall) and France created Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

The Alawites, a minority group living on the coast, eventually gained control of Syria by partnering with other minorities against the Sunni Arab majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. The Assad regime, which has now been overthrown, was Alawite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The Sunni Arabs launched the recent revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Russian Intervention
Syria's system would have collapsed a decade ago without the intervention of the Russian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Historically, the Soviets were pro-Syrian due to Syria's anti-Israeli stance, which countered the U.S.-aligned Israel, reflecting a Cold War dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

More recently, the Putin government sought to launch aggressive wars in its periphery and eventually in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. To distract European and American attention, Russia intervened in the Syrian Civil War, which had already begun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Russia's objective was to protect the Assad government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Military Presence and Tactics
Russia transferred significant military assets, including aircraft and mercenaries operating under the banner of [[role_of_russias_wagner_group_in_african_conflicts | Wagner]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Although Wagner was initially used to provide deniability, the deployment of fighter bombers made Russia's direct involvement obvious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Russia maintains a substantial military footprint in Syria, with thousands of troops and one of its most powerful naval task forces stationed at naval bases like Baniyas and Tartus on the Syrian coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

During their intervention, Russian forces primarily targeted the secular Sunni Arab opposition rather than ISIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. They used artillery extensively, firing tens of thousands of shells into Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city, which reportedly killed around 100,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. The "war crime style military operations" seen in [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Ukraine]] were "honed" in the Syrian battle space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## Challenges for Russia's Position
With the Assad government overthrown, Russia faces significant challenges in withdrawing or supplying its forces:
*   **Logistics**: Russia lacks the airlift capacity of the United States to extract its forces from interior Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Land Exits**: Land routes are blocked:
    *   South leads to Jordan (a U.S. ally) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
    *   Southwest leads to Israel (a U.S. ally) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
    *   East leads to Iraq, where ISIS remnants persist, and onward to Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
    *   North leads to Turkey, which appears to have supported the militant push against the Assad regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Coastal Corridor**: Russia's only viable option is a narrow corridor to the coast through the city of Homs, which is a target for the militants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **Naval Limitations**: Even if forces reach the ports, Russian ships are generally considered poor quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
    *   **Long Route**: Sailing through the Mediterranean, around Iberia, past France, Britain, and Scandinavia to Murmansk (above the Arctic Circle) is a challenging, potentially impossible journey for these ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Furthermore, European ports would confiscate Russian ships if they attempted to dock due to the [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | war in Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
    *   **Black Sea Route**: The closer port of Novorossiysk in the Black Sea is inaccessible to warships from the Mediterranean due to the Treaty of Montreux, which Turkey manages and enforces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

## [[implications_of_russian_military_presence_in_the_middle_east | Strategic Consequences]]
The Syrian Civil War's next phase will likely see Sunni Arab militants, who intensely dislike Russia, consolidate control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Control of Russian ships and naval ports will likely be a high priority for various countries willing to aid a new Syrian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. The destruction of Russia's most capable naval task force would be a significant achievement for any faction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

This situation marks the beginning of a series of [[implications_of_russian_military_presence_in_the_middle_east | strategic humiliations]] for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. The loss of Syrian ports and naval assets will cut off Russia's ability to supply equipment, materials, and troops to the African theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This will lead to a "cascade of strategic collapses" of Russia's military presence throughout the Middle East and Africa, affecting countries like Burkina Faso, Niger, Sudan, and Libya within weeks to months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

New data from the United Nations provides an updated assessment of [[Chinese demographics and population collapse | Chinese demographics]], revealing a severe situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This data indicates that China is experiencing the fastest aging workforce in human history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Demographic Trends

The number of new workers entering the Chinese workforce is significantly smaller than the number of retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This has led to a collapse in the number of children under age five, with roughly twice as many people aged 15 as there are aged five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

A sudden collapse in the birth rate occurred around 2017, predating the COVID-19 pandemic. This saw a roughly 40% decline in the birth rate over five years among the ethnic Han population, and over 50% among many minority groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. While anecdotal evidence suggests COVID-19 further dropped the birth rate and likely increased the death rate, the Chinese government stopped collecting death data during the reopening, making accurate assessment difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

The Shanghai Academy of Sciences estimates that China has overcounted its population under age 45 by more than 100 million people following the one-child policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. It is suggested that China passed the point of demographic no-return over two decades ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. India likely became the world's most populous country around a decade ago, and the average Chinese person probably became older than the average American in 2007 or 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. These observations indicate that China is not merely in demographic decay but in the advanced stages of [[demographic_challenges_facing_china | demographic collapse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Economic and Industrial Implications

The dramatic demographic shift has several significant consequences:
*   **Massive Increase in Labor Costs** <br>
    The imbalance between new workers and retirees is causing a significant increase in labor costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Chinese labor costs have been rising at the fastest pace of any country in history, even exceeding rates seen during the Black Death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Since 2000, the cost of Chinese labor has increased by approximately 15 times, while the size of the Chinese economy has only expanded by a factor of roughly 3.5 to 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Reliance on Sunk Costs** <br>
    China's status as an industrial power is primarily due to the significant sunk cost of its existing industrial infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Industry Relocation** <br>
    Many industries and sub-sectors have already opted to relocate from China, finding shorter, simpler supply chains and less political complexity in other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Future Outlook

This is projected to be the final decade during which China can exist as a modern industrialized nation-state, as it will simply lack the necessary population to sustain this status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Businesses operating in China face a future where the labor force will not recover, current labor costs are as low as they will ever be, and consumption is at its peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Beyond political, operational, energy, geopolitical, and regulatory risks, the fundamental demographic numbers no longer support the previous economic model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. While the sunk cost of industrial plants remains a factor, its relevance diminishes each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

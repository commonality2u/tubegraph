The Chinese banking system is a primary conduit for capital into the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. The prevailing method for encouraging economic activity in China involves the state pressuring banks to lend broadly at near-zero or negative interest rates, adjusted for inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. While this approach can initially spur economic growth, its stability and sustainability are highly questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.

## Nonperforming Loans (NPLs)

The Chinese banking system faces a significant challenge with nonperforming loans (NPLs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. This issue is likened to past financial crises in the United States, such as subprime mortgages, Enron, or the Savings and Loan crisis, where a bottomless supply of capital led to unsustainable lending practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

In the U.S., if 1.5% by value of a bank's loans become NPLs, regulators intervene to enforce policy changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. Banks typically become unstable and "snap like matchsticks" if their NPL ratio exceeds 2%, as their margins are insufficient to overcome the bad loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. In China, bank margins are often zero or even negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

Due to a perceived lack of the concept of "fiduciary responsibility" in Mandarin, many loans are made that should not have been, leading to a high rate of defaults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. Internal estimates suggest China's total NPL ratio for its entire banking sector is between 5.5% and 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. This average effectively means the entire sector is "out of luck," with some banks significantly worse off than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

## Regional Disparities

The stability of banks varies geographically:
*   **Coastal Regions** Banks on the coast generally operate with tighter controls due to higher investment inflows, export outflows, and engagement with foreign money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.
*   **Interior Regions** Banks in the interior, particularly in poorer and more agricultural areas, are largely dominated by [[chinese_capital_management_and_state_investment | Chinese State Banks]] (the "big four" national banks or smaller regional ones) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. These are generally less stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

## Addressing the Banking Crisis

For the [[challenges_in_the_chinese_economy | Chinese economy]] to improve, the banking system must be reformed to function more normally, which requires disposing of the massive volume of NPLs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. Historically, in the U.S., NPL disposal has only occurred during recessions linked to the financial sector, such as the 2007-2009 subprime crisis or the 1980s Savings and Loan crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.

China's situation is considered to be at least an order of magnitude worse than these U.S. financial crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. Relative to its economy's strength compared to the U.S. economy, the situation is even more severe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

Recent stimulus measures, such as tweaking mortgage rates or reducing the reserve requirement (the percentage of deposits banks must hold back), are considered only "mildly stimulatory" and do not address the core issues of an aging population and government's disinterest in private consumption as an economic driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

While the [[chinese_real_estate_market_and_investment | Chinese stock market]] may experience temporary upticks, the underlying banking issues remain unaddressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. Making credit more accessible when it is already overextended will only exacerbate the eventual collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.

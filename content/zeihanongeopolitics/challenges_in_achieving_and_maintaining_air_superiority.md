Ukraine is preparing for a major offensive, likely several months away, by readying the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This preparation involves receiving a large allotment of F-16s from NATO countries, following significant arms packages from Europe and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Over the past few weeks, Ukrainian forces have become more aggressive, turning Russian assaults into "killing grounds" and increasing the pace of counter-assaults south of the Nea River, where Russians have suffered 20-to-1 casualty ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Preparing the Battlefield: Targeting Air Defense
A key aspect of Ukraine's military strategy is using mid-range rockets and missiles to target Russian aviation assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. These strikes occur deep within Russia, sometimes 500 miles from the border, and throughout the Crimean Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Specific targets include anti-aircraft batteries, notably the S-300s and the more advanced S-400s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The S-400s are considered among the best in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. In recent weeks, Ukrainians have reportedly taken out at least four S-400 batteries, one of which had only been operational for a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

The objective of these actions is to deny Russia as much air defense as possible before the F-16s arrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. If Ukraine can establish regional or even temporary local air superiority, they can effectively utilize the training and equipment provided by the NATO alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This strategy directly addresses [[russian_air_defense_vulnerabilities | Russian air defense vulnerabilities]].

## Past [[challenges_faced_by_ukrainian_forces | Challenges Faced by Ukrainian Forces]]: The Need for Air Power
During the initial counter-offensives in 2022 and 2023, Russian forces had not heavily fortified their positions, allowing Ukrainians to make significant gains and inflict heavy casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. However, as the war progressed, Russians began to establish multi-layered defenses, including extensive minefields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

NATO training equipped Ukrainian forces with combined arms tactics, integrating infantry, mounted infantry, tanks, helicopters, missiles, and aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Despite this training, Ukraine lacked the necessary air power to execute these strategies effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Without air support during major assaults, Russian forces maintained the ability to deny Ukraine access to the skies, enabling them to call in effective artillery strikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This imbalance caused subsequent counter-offensives to bog down, resulting in minimal gains despite significant casualties and equipment losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Current Strategy and Potential Impact
The current Ukrainian strategy is to meticulously prepare the battlefield to avoid past air power deficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The goal is to ensure that newly acquired aircraft, like the F-16s, can operate in a less contested environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. If successful, Ukraine can counter Russian force concentrations with their own artillery, reversing the previous dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Ukrainians have already shown improved capabilities in recent weeks, taking out strategic radar systems deep within Russian territory even without dedicated air power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Strategic Objectives in Crimea
If F-16s begin arriving in about a month, Ukraine could potentially achieve regional air superiority over most of the Crimean Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. This would significantly ease the process of cutting the remaining infrastructure links connecting Russia to the southern front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The two primary links are the Kerch Bridge, which is already damaged, and a supplementary rail system running through occupied Ukrainian territory on the southern coast, already within artillery range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

The long-term objective is to leverage superior speed, innovation, and reach to disrupt Russian logistical capacities, isolate large pockets of troops, and create the kind of political humiliation that has historically led to Russian government collapses or climbdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. While the capture of Crimea would not signify the end of the war, given the robust Russian logistics in Donbas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, a major military defeat in Crimea could fall into the category of events that trigger significant political consequences within Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. The success of this strategy hinges on Ukrainian forces adapting effectively to operating the F-16s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

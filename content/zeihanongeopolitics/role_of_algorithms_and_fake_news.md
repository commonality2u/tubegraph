The effectiveness of propaganda relies on a population that is not well-informed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. For a populace to be well-informed, it requires multiple credible sources of information where there is a shared agreement on basic facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, a condition that no longer fully exists in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Historical Context of Declining Media Credibility

The shift began in the 1980s with the introduction of the fax machine, which reduced the need for extensive staffing abroad in news organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This led to the disappearance of roles like copy editors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The 1990s saw further reductions with the advent of email and attachments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. By the 2000s, most foreign bureaus had closed, leaving only a few roving reporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The rise of the internet prompted more cost-cutting, leading to the replacement of roving reporters with local stringers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. While stringers provided local insights, their reports often lacked proper fact-checking and were influenced by their personal biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Emergence of Algorithms and Fake News

Today, algorithms are used to write newspaper stories and scrape the web for information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This shift has largely eliminated traditional fact-checking processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

In this environment, it becomes extremely easy for charismatic politicians to dismiss inconvenient information as "fake news" and claim their own statements are the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This leads to the formation of political movements centered around a single person rather than institutions or verifiable information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. News organizations struggle to act as reliable detectors of truth because the fundamental fact-checking necessary for an informed populace is largely gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. People then place their trust in individuals instead of established institutions or diverse information sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This phenomenon contributes to the [[impact_of_misinformation_on_social_media | impact of misinformation on social media]] and [[challenges_facing_credible_news_consumption | challenges facing credible news consumption]].

## Impact on Information Consumption

The current media landscape, particularly in the United States, operates as a business focused on viewership, leading to a prioritization of what people *want* to hear over what is true or necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

*   **Cable News**: Channels like Fox and MSNBC are primarily opinion programs with minimal news content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Newsmax is cited as being "100% opinion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **Social Media**:
    *   Twitter has become "colorful" in its content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, reflecting [[changes_in_twitters_content_moderation | changes in Twitter's content moderation]].
    *   Facebook is described as one of the worst sources for news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
    *   TikTok is considered better than Facebook for news consumption, though still limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

This [[impact_of_technology_on_media_credibility | impact of technology on media credibility]] creates an "information desert" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, similar to environments like the Middle East where information vacuums lead to the rumor mill becoming the news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. In Russia, the rumor mill is exacerbated by a state monopoly on information, resulting in widespread state-sponsored propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, illustrating the [[impact_of_misinformation_within_russian_government | impact of misinformation within Russian government]].

For a [[comparison_of_global_media_sources | comparison of global media sources]], some international and national news outlets are identified as more reliable:

*   **International**: Al Jazeera (reliable for international news, but biased on Middle East issues) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, France 24 (maintains global bureaus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. BBC is noted for its decline in quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, and Canadian broadcasting is described as entirely opinion-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Local news sources worldwide can also offer unique perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   **United States**: The Wall Street Journal (strong in financial news) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, Bloomberg (broad and even-handed coverage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, and Straight Arrow News (a newer project aiming for non-partisan views with diverse contributors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

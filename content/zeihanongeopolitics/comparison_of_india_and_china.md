Many observers question if [[India's demographic and industrial growth potential|India]] will become the next China, given its large population, current faster growth rate, and recent population growth exceeding China's numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. However, this is largely deemed unlikely, a outcome [[India's demographic and industrial growth potential|India]] should be pleased with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

The successes of China's [[Economic Growth Models of India and China|economic growth model]] were built upon three primary factors:

## Strategic Largesse and Globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>

China's rise as a manufacturing powerhouse was enabled by the United States' strategic generosity in establishing a globalized system after World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This system allowed for global import and export without the need for military protection of territory or sea lanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This framework was further solidified when Nixon's visit to Mao engineered the Sino-Soviet split, making China an ally of the U.S. during the later Cold War years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

However, the U.S. has since lost interest in this arrangement and now views China as a rival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The U.S. is systematically dismantling aspects of this access, impacting sectors like agriculture, energy, and especially semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The U.S. has the power to halt China's access overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This suggests a future for China's economy without readily available exports, imports, or market access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

In contrast, [[India]] largely missed out on this globalized system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. It was pro-Soviet during the Cold War and remained somewhat pro-Russian even after the Soviet Union's collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. While this meant [[India's demographic and industrial growth potential|India]] didn't experience the massive growth China saw from the 1980s to the 2010s, resulting in a much smaller economy, it also means [[India's demographic and industrial growth potential|India]] is less vulnerable to the system's collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Hyper-Financialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>

China's [[Economic Growth Models of India and China|economic growth model]] involves hyper-financialization, where the state confiscates public bank deposits and savings to flood projects with funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This creates a bottomless supply of zero-percent loans, ensuring employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. While this generates economic growth, it is highly inefficient and often non-productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. When such a system collapses, it leads to a comprehensive crisis impacting all sectors, including agriculture, potentially causing famine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

[[India's strategic limitations and geographic constraints|India]] does not face this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. The [[India's strategic limitations and geographic constraints|Indian]] system is capital-poor, with limited navigable waterways and very low per-person capital availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. However, this means [[India's demographic and industrial growth potential|India]] treats capital as an economic good rather than a political tool, as seen in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. While this limits rapid growth, it also prevents the instability inherent in China's financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>

China is experiencing a significant "hollowing out" of its demographic system due to rapid aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This is not the case in [[Demographics and economic growth in India|India]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. While [[Demographics and economic growth in India|India]] is also transitioning to a "chimney demography" (equal numbers across age groups due to industrialization), this process started later and is proceeding slower than in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

[[Demographics and economic growth in India|India]] is undergoing rapid aging, but from a much later start and at a relatively slow pace compared to its peers, and especially compared to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. As a result, [[Demographics and economic growth in India|India]] currently has a large population under 40 who are still consuming and capable of having children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. In the coming decades (10, 20, 30, 40 years), [[Demographics and economic growth in India|India]] is projected to have a large number of people aged 40 to 65 who will be capital-rich and contribute high value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Even if only 10% of [[India's demographic and industrial growth potential|India]]'s 1.5 billion people fall into this category, it represents a significant economic force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

In a worst-case scenario where birth rates decline and the [[Demographics and economic growth in India|Indian]] population continues to age, [[Demographics and economic growth in India|India]] is still expected to remain the world's largest population for at least another half-century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. It will not face a European-style demographic crunch for at least 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This suggests that even under unfavorable conditions, [[India's demographic and industrial growth potential|India]]'s future looks promising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

## Geographic Advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>

[[India's strategic limitations and geographic constraints|India]] possesses a key advantage over China: proximity to necessary resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Australia is a more amicable partner to [[India's demographic and industrial growth potential|India]] than to China, ensuring access to food and mineral supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Furthermore, the [[India's strategic limitations and geographic constraints|Indian]] subcontinent is the first stop from the Persian Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. This makes [[India's demographic and industrial growth potential|India]] one of the least likely countries to experience an energy crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. In contrast, China is at the end of a long, easily disruptible supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## [[Challenges and Advantages Facing India|India's Challenges]] vs. China's Problems

While [[Challenges and Advantages Facing India|India]] faces its own set of concerns, such as inefficiency, women's rights issues and their impact on economic growth, the presence of Pakistan, and corruption, these are considered an order of magnitude less severe than the problems currently plaguing China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. [[Challenges and Advantages Facing India|India]]'s challenges are survivable, and the country can either find solutions or cope with them as it continues to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Conversely, China is perceived to be very close to an economic end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

Chrystia Freeland, a former journalist, has held significant roles within the Canadian government, including Foreign Minister, Finance Minister, and Deputy Prime Minister of a G7 country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:07">[01:53:07]</a>. She is considered one of the smartest individuals globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:04">[02:01:04]</a>, arguably the smartest in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:04">[02:06:04]</a>, and certainly the most intelligent person in the Canadian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

## Background and Early Career

Before entering politics, Freeland was a journalist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:04">[01:42:04]</a>. She was notably on the Putin government's list due to her early investigations into him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:03">[01:44:03]</a>.

## Political Ascendance and Influence

Freeland has been instrumental in "re-creating what Canada means in the modern age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. Her diplomatic and policy work has been particularly significant:

*   **Handling [[canadas_relationship_with_the_united_states | US-Canada Relations]]**: She became Foreign Minister approximately eight years ago, coinciding with Donald Trump's first day in office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. During this period, the established framework for [[canadas_economic_and_trade_relations_with_the_united_states | Canada's relationship with the United States]] was disrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. Canada, previously a lower priority for the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, suddenly became a top trading partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. Freeland was tasked with navigating these shifts on the fly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
*   **Macroeconomic and Foreign Policy Successes**: Any successes Canada has achieved in macroeconomic policy, foreign affairs, and particularly in [[canadas_relationship_with_the_united_states | relations with the United States]], are largely credited to her, regardless of the American president in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

## Spat with Justin Trudeau and Resignation

Recently, Chrystia Freeland had a disagreement with the Trudeau leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>, leading to her departure from the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. The immediate cause of the spat was Donald Trump's threat of tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. Justin Trudeau reportedly intended to spend money to offset the impact of these tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. Freeland, understanding the financial unsustainability of this approach for Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>, sought a better solution. When her preferences were not met, she resigned as Finance Minister and declined an alternative job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. Her departure means that the "brains behind the face" of the government are now out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

## Future Implications

With Freeland's departure, the future of the Trudeau government is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. She holds significant sway within Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>, potentially able to oust the current government with a simple vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. There is also the possibility of her taking over the [[leadership_crisis_in_the_canadian_liberal_party | Liberal Party leadership]] herself, potentially ending the 25-year period without an intelligent person at its helm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. Whether she could win a premiership in a new election remains to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.

## Initial Predictions and Discrepancies
Early predictions suggested that by June, approximately 500,000 [[russian_military_reserves_and_activation | Russian soldiers]] would be deployed on the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. However, this projection was based on Russian data, which is often unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The most probable explanation for the discrepancy is that Russian President Vladimir Putin was misled about the actual state of the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Putin's inner circle is reportedly composed largely of sycophants, with only a few competent individuals, none of whom are in charge of the defense industry or military plans in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Key Figures and Incompetence
Two officials are highlighted for their significant military incompetence:
*   **Sergey Shoigu**: The Russian Defense Minister, considered by some to be the most incompetent person in the Russian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. He is responsible for the overall battle plan and the defense industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. It is believed that Shoigu personally embezzled one-third of the defense equipment budget over several years, with another third stolen by his subordinates, leading to significant [[impact_of_equipment_and_manpower_shortages_on_russian_military | equipment shortages]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Dmitry Prigozhin**: The head of the Wagner Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Previously a caterer, Prigozhin received government funding to build a parallel military group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Despite leading the [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | military operation]] in Bakhmut, he lacks experience in managing, leading, or participating in military operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Significant Casualties
The [[Russian military strategy and casualties | Russian military]] has sustained heavy losses, particularly in the battle for Bakhmut.
*   **Bakhmut**: Over six months, conservative estimates suggest at least 20,000 Russian deaths and 100,000 injuries in Bakhmut alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. These numbers are likely significantly higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This single battle, which is not considered strategically significant, has depleted a large portion of the Russian government's mobilization programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Estimated Overall Losses
> Best estimates indicate that the [[Russian military strategy and casualties | Russian military]] has lost between 100,000 and 200,000 men killed since the start of the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. In addition to the 100,000 injured in Bakhmut, another 100,000 have likely been injured elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Mobilization Efforts and Troop Quality
When the [[Russian military challenges and recruitment issues | Russian invasion]] began in February 2022, they had approximately 100,000 to 140,000 troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. A partial mobilization added another 300,000 troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Impact of Losses**: The estimated total of 100,000 injured throughout the war, 100,000 specifically in Bakhmut, and at least 100,000 dead, effectively negates the entire 300,000 from the first partial mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Second Partial Mobilization**: A second partial mobilization of potentially 200,000 to 250,000 troops is likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. However, this means the overall troop numbers are not significantly higher than what they started with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Troop Quality**: The new recruits are expected to be significantly less skilled than initial forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Many of these new recruits have been tasked with building [[russian_defensive_positions_and_supply_challenges | anti-tank fortifications]] rather than engaging in direct combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

These factors suggest that the [[ukrainian_military_strategy_and_offensive_preparations | Ukrainian counter-offensive]] may face less resistance than initially anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. However, the "fog of war" and continued misinformation within the Russian government about the true status of the conflict remain significant variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

Yevgeny Prigozhin, leader of the [[wagner_group_and_its_role_in_russian_military_operations | Wagner Group]], was reportedly on a plane that went down in Russia, leading to his presumed death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. His death is considered a high-probability outcome given his "life choices and the people he surrounded himself with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The list of individuals and groups who might have wanted him dead is extensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Potential Perpetrators and Motives

### Vladimir Putin
Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia, is considered a primary candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Prigozhin had been relied upon by Putin for "unsavory things" for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This included a "meat grinder assault" in the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, which resulted in at least 30,000 Russian soldier deaths, with some estimates suggesting up to 100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Prigozhin's [[wagner_group_coup_attempt_in_russia | pseudo coup]] and public insults toward the Russian military-industrial complex would have given Putin a reason to "snip" him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Russian Military-Industrial Complex
Prigozhin also angered the Russian military-industrial complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. It's important to note that Russia's military and industrial complexes are separate entities, unlike in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The industrial part, involved in weapons manufacturing, includes figures like Chemizov, who is part of Putin's inner circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. However, Prigozhin's insults were primarily directed at the military proper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The military is not part of Vladimir Putin's direct coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Putin's Inner Circle and Organized Crime
Putin's coalition consists of former intelligence operatives from the KTB (now FSB) and [[role_of_organized_crime_in_russian_cyber_operations | organized crime]] elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Prigozhin initially gained Putin's attention as a caterer who voiced opinions that resonated with Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This connection led to state contracts and the creation of the [[wagner_group_and_its_role_in_russian_military_operations | Wagner military group]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Many in Putin's inner circle and the world of [[role_of_organized_crime_in_russian_cyber_operations | organized crime]] may have wanted Prigozhin dead, either because he exploited them or because he was a stepping stone in their own pursuit of Putin's favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### Foreign Actors
Potential suspects extend beyond Russia's borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

*   **Ukrainians:** Ukraine had reason to want Prigozhin dead as he was responsible for many Ukrainian deaths during the Bakhmut siege <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Poles:** Poland was concerned after Prigozhin and Wagner were supposed to relocate to Belarus following the coup deal but instead settled on the Polish border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Belarus:** Lukashenka, the President of Belarus, supposedly brokered the deal between Putin and Prigozhin after the coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. In the former Soviet world, such deals often "don't hold typically until someone is dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Americans:** Prigozhin founded the "troll factory" and openly bragged about interfering in the American presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Uncertainty and Implications

Despite reports, there was initial uncertainty regarding Prigozhin's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. While his name was on the manifest, only eight bodies were found at the time of reporting out of ten individuals on the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

If Prigozhin is indeed dead, it signals "only the beginning of the story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. His death creates an opening in Putin's inner circle for someone new to fill the role of providing "plausible deniability" for Russian operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

Prigozhin's past activities included:
*   Involvement in the "little green men" operations during the 2014 Crimea War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   Interfering in U.S. elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   Leading operations in a dozen African countries, where he was accused of war crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This highlights the [[role_of_russias_wagner_group_in_african_conflicts | role of Russia's Wagner group in African conflicts]].

This role is too crucial for the Russian state and the Kremlin to remain vacant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Someone will step forward, and whether that person is a "friend of Putin" or not will be significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

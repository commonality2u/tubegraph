Despite a year of [[chinas_postcovid_economic_challenges | sluggish economic recovery]] since the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese government has introduced various measures to stimulate its economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. While the government aims for 5% GDP growth, private assessments suggest the economy is experiencing a borderline recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Recent Stimulus Measures

In recent weeks, China has implemented several measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>:
*   **Mortgage Rate Reduction** Mortgage rates have been slightly tweaked downwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Reduced Reserve Requirement** The reserve requirement, which is the percentage of bank deposits that banks must hold back, has been lowered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This frees up more capital for lending.

## Limitations and Underlying Issues

These measures are considered "mildly stimulatory" but fail to address core [[challenges_in_the_chinese_economy | issues]] within the [[chinese_economic_model_and_government_intervention_limits | Chinese economic model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Demographic and Ideological Constraints
One significant problem is China's shrinking working-age population; there are now too few people under 50 to form a substantial consumption base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Furthermore, Chairman Xi Jinping's government ideologically views private consumption as less important than state-driven spending, which hinders efforts to boost consumer demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### Dysfunctional Banking Sector
A critical unaddressed issue is the [[state_control_and_limitations_on_private_savings_in_china | broken Chinese banking sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. The traditional [[chinese_economic_model_and_government_intervention_limits | Chinese economic model]] relies on state banks to lend widely at near-zero or even negative real interest rates, leading to an overextension of credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This has resulted in a massive accumulation of non-performing loans (NPLs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

While US banks face regulatory action if their NPL ratio exceeds 1.5% and risk collapse at 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, China's total NPL ratio across its banking sector is estimated to be between 5.5% and 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This indicates that, on average, the entire Chinese banking sector is effectively "out of luck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This issue is particularly acute in the interior, more agricultural regions, where state banks are dominant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Inevitable Consequences
For [[chinas_economic_strategies_and_challenges | Chinese economic growth]] to genuinely improve, the banking sector needs to normalize by disposing of these NPLs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Historically, this process in the US, as seen during the subprime crisis (2007-2009) and the Savings and Loan crisis (1980s), has involved financial sector-linked recessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. China's situation is considered an order of magnitude worse, relative to its economy's strength compared to the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Therefore, making credit easier when it is already overextended will likely only worsen the inevitable crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

China has been engaging in a strategy of stockpiling various essential resources, including foods, fuels, and materials, with the intention of enduring a prolonged conflict with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. However, the effectiveness of this strategy is highly questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Fundamental Import Dependency

[[chinas_import_dependency_on_energy_and_materials | China's import dependency on energy and materials]] is a significant challenge. China is the world's largest importer of energy, foodstuffs, materials required for food production, and nearly every mineral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The country produces very few raw materials internally, instead importing them for processing into value-added manufactured goods for export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This makes [[chinas_industrial_and_political_challenges | China]] vulnerable to supply chain disruptions across all industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Limitations of Stockpiling

Even if [[Chinas stockpiling strategy and its effectiveness | China's stockpiling strategy]] were to achieve its goals, such as accumulating a 120-day supply of oil, this reserve would only last for that specific duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

Furthermore, a critical vulnerability lies in the nature of China's storage facilities:
*   **Above-Ground Storage** Unlike the United States, which utilizes salt domes for strategic reserves, China lacks similar underground storage capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Consequently, much of China's stockpiling must occur above ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This makes these storage sites susceptible to missile attacks in the event of a hot war, potentially eliminating reserves within days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Perishability and Deterioration** Storing large quantities of goods, especially food, requires proper facilities to prevent spoilage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. An example is a massive corn storage facility built by China that consisted of large piles of corn along the roadside, which rotted and became unusable within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Similar issues are likely to affect other stored materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Broader Economic Vulnerabilities

Beyond storage, China's economic model relies heavily on exports, with the United States being its primary customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. A conflict would inevitably disrupt global trade and market access, negating the purpose of stockpiles if the ability to import and export is compromised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

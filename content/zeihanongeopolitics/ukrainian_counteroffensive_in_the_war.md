The [[ukrainian_counteroffensive_strategy | Ukrainian counteroffensive]] has faced significant challenges and strategic shifts since its commencement. Initially, the counteroffensive was not progressing as anticipated by Ukrainian forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

## Initial Challenges

Ukrainian forces encountered substantial difficulties in achieving breakthroughs against Russian defenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. The Russian military had established multiple lines of defense over several months, starting with minefields, followed by anti-tank barriers and trenches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. For the most part, Ukrainian troops struggled to even penetrate the initial minefields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

The nature of the fighting was described as a "slugfest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>, with Ukraine bogged down in attrition battles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. This was particularly disadvantageous for Ukraine due to Russia's greater industrial capacity, reserves, and a population that is at least three times larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. Any battle where Ukrainians lost one soldier for every three Russian soldiers was considered a loss for Ukraine, given their demographic and material disadvantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.

## Strategic Shift and Logistical Targets

Around June 23rd, 2023, the [[ukrainian_counteroffensive strategy | Ukrainian counteroffensive strategy]] began to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.
Ukrainian forces shifted their targeting from command and control bunkers to ammo dumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. This change typically precedes a major push, indicating an attempt to disrupt enemy forces and their supply lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

### Key Supply Bridge Attacks

A significant development was the targeting of critical supply bridges:

*   **Chonhar Bridge:** The Chonhar bridge in Crimea, vital for both rail and road connections, was hit by missiles, rendering its rail system impassable for weeks until repairs could be completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. A special kind of warhead was used to create a large hole, making it impassable for trucks and trains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.
*   **Kerch Bridge:** The Kerch Bridge had previously been attacked, with one of its two-lane road connections taken out and a rail car fire damaging the rail bridge, making it unable to handle cargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. This forced Russia to rely more heavily on land connections into Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>. The rail connection on the Kerch Bridge had still not been rebuilt months after the attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>, highlighting Russia's struggle with technical expertise due to a collapsing technical education system and demographic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>.

These attacks significantly impacted Russian logistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>. With the Chonhar bridge offline, all cargo to and from Ukraine had to be rerouted through a less efficient western bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. This effectively cut off Russian troops west of Mariupol from supplies coming from Russia proper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. It created a week-long window during which Russian forces would need to reroute everything further west, crossing a larger distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.

> "The troops in the multiple area are now completely cut off vulnerable they're not going to get reinforcements they're not going to get fueled they're not going to get artillery shells and ammo now would be the time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>

## Current Opportunity

The capture of Rostov-on-Don by the Wagner paramilitary group, which serves as the primary logistical and communications point for the Russian military in the Ukrainian War, presented a "golden opportunity" for the [[ukrainian_counteroffensive plans | Ukrainians]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>. As long as Rostov-on-Don is offline, Russian forces in Crimea and occupied Ukraine cannot receive reinforcements, equipment, or fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>. This situation places the entire Russian army in Ukraine at a severe disadvantage, as their logistical train depends on the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>.

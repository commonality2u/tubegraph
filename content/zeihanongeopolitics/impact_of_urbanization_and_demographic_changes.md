The world is experiencing significant shifts in its political and economic landscapes, partly driven by evolving [[changing_demographics_and_their_political_impact | demographic]] and economic patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Demographic Shifts and Political Rearrangement

As technology and [[demographic_shifts_and_economic_implications | demographic shifts and economic implications | economic patterns]] evolve, political factions within coalitions can lose relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This can lead to factions falling out of coalitions, becoming swing voters, or even switching sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The United States is currently undergoing a "once in every generation political rearrangement," with the rise and fall of hyper-globalization and the retirement of the Baby Boomer generation from the workforce impacting how the political system is managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Urbanization and Declining Birth Rates

A major global trend is the impact of urbanization on birth rates. When societies economically develop and industrialize, they also urbanize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. After approximately seven decades of global urbanization, people are consistently having fewer children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## Aging Populations and Workforce Decline

This long-term trend of declining birth rates leads to an aging population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Countries are not only running out of younger individuals (10- and 20-year-olds) but increasingly out of 50- and 60-year-olds in the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. The 2020s have been identified as the decade when many countries would begin to lack a sufficient workforce to support the globalized economic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Economic Implications: Consumption and Trade

The core economic implication of these [[impact_of_aging_populations_in_europe_and_japan | demographic changes]] is directly tied to consumption and trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Without sufficient consumption, global trade cannot be sustained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This means that the global economic network is currently collapsing and reforming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Such significant changes in how societies live, work, and conduct business are expected to generate considerable stress, leading to potential social and political volatility and even violence, both domestically and internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

Europe has actively sought to reduce its reliance on Russian natural gas, leading to a significant decrease in Gazprom's output to its lowest levels since 1978, predating the Soviet collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The objective has been to cut dependence on [[european_sanctions_on_russian_natural_gas | Russian natural gas]] to zero, a goal that has been largely successful, particularly for piped gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Why Reducing Russian Gas Dependence Works

The effectiveness of these efforts is attributed to the inherent nature of natural gas itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Natural gas requires a specialized system for production, transport, and export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Any disruption in this system—whether involving insurance, pipes, pumps, or legalities—can halt the entire operation, as natural gas cannot be easily redirected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

Most of Russia's piped gas to Europe originates from the Urengoy area, which has been in production for half a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This gas travels thousands of miles through pipelines via Ukraine and Belarus into countries like Poland, Germany, Slovakia, and Hungary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Since this supply cannot be rerouted, Russia was compelled to gradually shut down operations as European countries ceased deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Limitations of Russia's Other Gas Options

Russia possesses other natural gas resources, including supplies from Eastern Siberia that go to China, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities on Sakhalin Island (primarily for Japan) and the Yamal Peninsula (primarily shipped to Europe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. However, these facilities, along with the Kavita field near Lake Baikal, are technically challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Their development was largely undertaken by foreign companies, such as BP, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and ExxonMobil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Most of these foreign companies have now exited or significantly reduced their involvement, leaving Russia without the necessary technical skills to maintain these projects long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

The Urengoy zone, though a mature production area, could potentially be revived using shale technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. However, shale extraction requires significant labor and is impractical in regions that freeze solid due to the high water demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Given Urengoy's remote and cold location, its significant production is unlikely to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## Europe's Successful Diversification Strategies

Russian gas exports to Europe have fallen by 85% compared to the start of the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Only a small trickle continues to flow to the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary, countries that currently lack viable alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. These three nations have been the most resistant to broader sanctions regimes, and most exceptions to the sanctions have involved them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

However, Europe is rapidly building new interconnections to sever its remaining ties to [[challenges_in_russian_natural_gas_industry | Russian natural gas]] for good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This ongoing infrastructure development suggests that the current reliance of these countries may change soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

Despite initial concerns, the price shocks felt by Europeans have been relatively mild <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Europe has successfully brought in liquefied natural gas (LNG) from other suppliers, particularly from the Persian Gulf and the [[european_energy_dependency_on_the_united_states | United States]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. While this has placed price pressure on other regions that previously relied on these suppliers, Europe's sanctions regime has effectively cut Russian exports and income without unduly shocking its own energy system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

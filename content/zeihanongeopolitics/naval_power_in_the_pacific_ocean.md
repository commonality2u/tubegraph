The balance of naval power in the Pacific Ocean, particularly between the United States and China, is undergoing significant shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. While concerns exist regarding China's numerical superiority in ships, the focus should extend beyond mere quantity to critical qualitative factors like weapon system range and technological advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## [[Comparison of US and Chinese naval capabilities | US vs. China Naval Comparison]]

In terms of ship numbers, China possesses a larger fleet, estimated between 370 and 620 vessels, while the United States has between 250 and 300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. However, the qualitative differences are substantial:

*   **Chinese Fleet:** Most Chinese vessels are small, often only a couple thousand tons, and are considered too vulnerable and limited in range by US standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Only about 10% of China's ships can travel more than 1,000 miles, and very few have a strike capability exceeding a couple thousand miles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Their ballistic missiles designed to target US naval assets rely on satellite reconnaissance for targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **US Fleet:** American supercarriers are fully "Blue Water" capable, meaning they can operate globally, and their aircraft can strike targets at considerable distances, especially with standoff missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The US also possesses a superior satellite warfare system, demonstrated by its ability to destroy multiple old satellites to underline China's technological lag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## [[US naval weapon system developments | New US Weapon System Developments]]

By the end of the next calendar year (2024), the United States is set to deploy two new types of weapon systems that will significantly alter the naval balance in the Pacific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>:

### Land-Based Intermediate-Range Missiles

The US is deploying land-based intermediate-range missiles, a capability that was previously restricted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This development follows the 2019 demise of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which had barred land-based missiles with ranges between 500 km and 5,500 km <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The treaty's abrogation was due to Russia's deployment of such systems and China's mass implementation despite never being a signatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

These new US systems are being deployed to US territories like Midway and Guam, and potentially Darwin, Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This will enable the US to launch cruise missiles with ranges in the thousands of kilometers, capable of intersecting Chinese shipping routes and naval patrols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### Sea-Targetable Tomahawk Cruise Missiles

A new version of the Tomahawk cruise missile is being deployed primarily to submarines, enabling them to target maritime vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The Tomahawk, first debuted in 1992 during the Gulf War, is known for its ability to follow GPS maps and strike targets over a thousand miles away with a half-ton warhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

The key advancement is the ability to target moving ships, which requires active eyes on the missile's flight path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This is facilitated by the US's more well-rounded approach to artificial intelligence (AI), including its application in weapon systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Unlike China, which tightly controls AI development to prevent independent decision-making and focuses on social monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>, the US leverages AI for advanced guidance.

These new Tomahawks, combined with the quietest and longest-range submarines, provide a significant capability to target and neutralize Chinese naval vessels with range in a hot war scenario, effectively limiting China's ability to project power far from its coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

## Political Context for Delayed Deployment

The re-emergence and deployment of these weapon systems, based on technologies from the late 1980s and early 1990s, have been significantly delayed by political and administrative factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>:

*   **Clinton Administration (1990s):** In the early post-Cold War era, the focus was on fostering international friendships, not developing weapons to target potential allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **W. Bush Administration (early 2000s):** While relations with Russia and China began to sour, the administration was preoccupied with conflicts in the Islamic world, especially Afghanistan, where Russia was a more reliable partner for logistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Obama Administration (2009-2017):** Despite Russia's renewed aggression and China's extensive cyber espionage and intellectual property theft, little action was taken on these weapon systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. President Obama was perceived as disengaged from such strategic development and unofficially viewed the military as an "enemy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   **Trump Administration (2017-2021):** Updates to strategic doctrine and new weapon systems development were not compatible with the administration's modus operandi, leading to "strategic incompetence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

It was not until the Biden Administration that firm decisions were made regarding the development and employment of these systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. President Biden's long experience in politics meant he already understood the context and necessity for these developments from the 1980s and 90s, leading to more robust and forward-looking security decision-making not seen since the George H.W. Bush administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

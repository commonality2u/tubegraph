The Kirsten offensive in the Ukraine war concluded with Ukrainian forces recapturing the city from the Russians around November 13th, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Following the recapture, Ukrainians began sweeping the area for remaining soldiers, of whom there were thousands, and assessing captured equipment, which appeared substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Reasons for Russian Withdrawal

The primary reason for the Russian withdrawal from Kirsten was their inability to supply troops on the west side of the Dnieper River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. After the Kerch Bridge went offline a couple of months prior, Russia was forced to run all logistics by truck, a method approximately 1/500th as efficient in a war zone compared to their usual rail-based supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Broader Logistical Implications

The logistical problems experienced in Kirsten now apply to the entirety of the Southern front and the Crimean Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Key Supply Choke Points and Their Vulnerabilities

*   **Dnieper River Bridges near Kirsten/Nova Kakhovka:** Two bridges near Kirsten and Nova Kakhovka have been disabled, requiring months for proper repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. While theoretical pontoon crossings are possible, they would face heavy Russian resistance and logistical issues similar to those the Russians faced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Kerch Strait Bridge:** This bridge remains the only rail connection between Russia proper and the Southern front, including Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. With it compromised, supplies must go by truck, often rerouting around the Sea of Azov, which is twice to three times the distance, 100 times the fuel cost, and transports significantly less cargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Crimean Isthmus Land Routes:** There are three ways into Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>:
    *   The Kerch Strait Bridge.
    *   An eastern bridge, expected to be targeted by Ukrainians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
    *   A narrow five-mile-wide western Isthmus, now well within range of Ukrainian middle-range missiles following the fall of Kirsten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Sevastopol Port:** While a good port, [[challenges_faced_by_ukrainian_forces | Ukrainian forces]] have proven capable of targeting it with maritime drones and long-range missiles, effectively making it a "dead port" for military and civilian shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Partisan Attacks

Russian logistics are further hampered by partisan attacks. Early in the war, Javelin missiles targeted trucks, destroying over two-thirds of the Russian tactical military truck support fleet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Russia has since resorted to using civilian vehicles like city buses and "Scooby-Doo vans" to transport troops, gear, fuel, and artillery shells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. These civilian vehicles are vulnerable even to small arms fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. A partisan campaign has been ongoing in Mariupol since the second month of the war, making it a highly dangerous supply line for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## Anticipated Ukrainian Ground Thrust

Despite the logistical denial, a ground thrust is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. The [[ukrainian_counteroffensive_strategy | Ukrainian counteroffensive strategy]] will likely launch from Nipper (Dnipro), a river city further north, rather than Kirsten proper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This is because:
*   Bridges in Kirsten are out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   Launching from Kirsten would create similar logistical supply problems across a narrow choke point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   It would involve deploying directly into Russian forces on the south side of the river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

From Nipper, Ukraine can deploy on multiple axes, at multiple points, and at multiple time frames without worrying about shelling at bottlenecks, as Russians are not present there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Potential Targets for the [[potential_ukrainian_counteroffensive | Ukrainian Counteroffensive]]

*   **Melitopol:** Considered a prime target due to its isolated position, making it easier to attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   **Mariupol:** A viable target due to its symbolic significance and its current role as the primary logistical supply point for Russian trucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

Wherever Ukraine punches south, the goal is to cut off everything to the west, leaving Russian forces completely isolated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

## Russia's Imminent Dilemma

Russia faces a critical choice:
*   Engage in a "most humiliating withdrawal" from all territory west of Mariupol and Kerch, including Zaporizhzhia Province, Kirsten Province, and Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   Stand pat and suffer "one of the most humiliating military defeats in Russian history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### Dire Outlook for Crimea

If Russia cannot bring in food, fuel, and troops through the limited connections, Crimea will face catastrophic consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   **Population & Military Support:** Crimea's population of 3 million is insufficient to support a large-scale military operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Fuel:** Crimea has no oil or refineries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Shipping:** No ships are coming into Sevastopol Port due to [[challenges_faced_by_ukrainian_forces | Ukrainian]] maritime drones and long-range missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. The Russians have basically evacuated completely from the western half of the Black Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Food:** Crimea relies on the Crimean Canal for water, which sources from a sluice gate in Kirsten Province near Nova Kakhovka, now under Ukrainian control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. This means the canal is unlikely to be turned on in the spring, leading to the loss of 80% of Crimea's self-produced food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

The combination of these factors points to a "sprawling 1980s style Ethiopia style famine" that would "utterly destroy any hope the Russians have of having any functional military position anywhere in the peninsula or the southern front" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

## The War's Future

Despite these significant developments, the war is not over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. The Russian occupations of Donetsk and Luhansk provinces are not affected by these logistical problems, as they can be supported directly by rail from the Russian mainland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Ukraine will need to dislodge them through traditional military means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. The [[ukrainian_counteroffensive_in_the_war | Ukrainian recapture of Kirsten]] marks the beginning of the end of the "easy part" of the war for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

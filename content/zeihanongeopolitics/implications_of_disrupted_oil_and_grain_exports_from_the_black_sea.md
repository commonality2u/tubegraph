Recent developments in the Black Sea region, particularly Ukrainian naval drone attacks, have significantly increased the risk to both military and commercial shipping, potentially leading to a profound reordering of international energy markets and [[global_and_regional_economic_consequences_of_an_oil_disruption | global and regional economic consequences of an oil disruption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:59">[09:59:59]</a>.

## Escalation of Naval Drone Attacks

Ukrainian forces have increasingly utilized naval drones of expanding range, explosive power, and sophistication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>. These drones, essentially motorboats loaded with a metric ton of explosives, are difficult for conventional naval forces to target due to their low profile in the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a>.

Originally used to strike Russian military vessels near Sevastopol, these attacks have been so successful that the Russians have largely evacuated their military vessels to safer ports in Russia proper, such as Novorossiysk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:17">[00:46:17]</a>. More recently, these drones have been used to target the Kerch Strait Bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:08">[01:43:08]</a>.

On August 4th, a Ukrainian naval drone successfully struck a Russian amphibious military vessel in the port of Novorossiysk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. This attack suggests either a "Quantum Leap" in Ukrainian drone range or the involvement of a third party, possibly Turkey, in facilitating their delivery closer to targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. Regardless, there are now no safe operating areas for Russian vessels in the Black Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:48">[03:41:48]</a>.

## Targeting Commercial Shipping

The conflict escalated further on August 5th when a Ukrainian naval drone hit the Russian-flagged tanker *Sig* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. The *Sig* typically transports aviation fuel between Novorossiysk and the Syrian port of Tartus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. While the tanker was empty and not sunk, its engine room was hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:04">[04:14:04]</a>.

Following this incident, Ukraine announced it would treat every ship entering or exiting any Russian port as a potential target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:28">[05:00:28]</a>. This mirrors Russia's long-standing policy regarding Ukrainian ports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:14">[05:09:14]</a>.

### Consequences for Russian Operations

If this trend continues, the entire [[strategic_implications_of_russian_military_logistics_disruption | Russian strategic position globally]] could be jeopardized due to a lack of fuel and inability to project power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. Russia's military operations in Latin America or Africa are dependent on the free movement of goods via sea, which would be severely hindered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.

### Broader Impact on Civilian Shipping

Ukraine has given civilian ships two weeks to vacate the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>. This threat, coupled with the ability of Ukrainian drones to strike several hundred miles from their ports, could effectively turn a significant portion of the Black Sea into a no-go zone for any vessels traveling to or from Russian ports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.

> "If you sail into a war zone where people are shooting, that goes up by roughly a factor of a hundred and if you sail into a war zone where someone is actively targeting civilian vessels you just can't get a policy at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>

This [[impact_of_geopolitical_tensions_on_shipping_routes | impact of geopolitical tensions on shipping routes]] could cause [[impact_of_ukrainian_attacks_on_russian_commercial_shipping | Ukrainian attacks on Russian commercial shipping]] to lead to the evaporation of maritime shipping globally in the Black Sea region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.

## Consequences for Russian Exports

The potential closure of Black Sea shipping routes would take out major Russian oil, ore, and grain export facilities at Novorossiysk and Tuapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.

[[consequences_for_russian_logistics_and_transport | Russia lacks the ability to redirect these exports]] because:
*   Other export points like Primorsk (Baltic) or Nakhodka (Pacific) are already at maximum capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.
*   The rail system is also at maximum capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.
*   Exporting through Ukraine to the port of Odesa is under embargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.

If these Black Sea exports are shut down, Russian crude oil wells could freeze in winter, rendering them offline for years or even decades without costly redrilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.

### Types of Crude and Market Impact

Approximately three million barrels per day (bpd) of crude are exported through Novorossiysk and Tuapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. This volume consists of two main types:
*   **Russian crude**: About half is a medium sour blend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>. If removed from the market, Canadian Select (a heavy sour blend) would likely be the biggest beneficiary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.
*   **CPC blend**: The other half comes from Kazakhstan's Tengiz superfield, transported by pipeline to Novorossiysk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>. This blend is "super light and super sweet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. Its removal would most benefit U.S. Shale crude, which shares similar properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.

### Global Customer Impact

This disruption would impact two major customer bases:
1.  **East Asia, primarily [[potential_consequences_for_chinas_economy_due_to_oil_supply_disruptions | China]]**: There would be no readily available replacement volumes for [[potential_consequences_for_chinas_economy_due_to_oil_supply_disruptions | Chinese]] buyers, as European countries have already secured alternative supplies post-war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>. This could severely impact the [[potential_consequences_for_chinas_economy_due_to_oil_supply_disruptions | Chinese economy]], which is already experiencing a significant slowdown and increasing trade tensions with the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.
2.  **Mediterranean Basin**: Companies in this region, which have largely moved away from Russian crude to CPC blend, would likely turn to U.S. Shale crude if CPC becomes unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>. U.S. Shale production has been expanding significantly, nearing record levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>.

This scenario could lead to a reordering of the international strategic environment, with a significant portion of the three million bpd disruption disproportionately affecting [[potential_consequences_for_chinas_economy_due_to_oil_supply_disruptions | China]], while Europe potentially covers its needs from North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. This would weaken Russia's economic penetration and its ability to project power globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>, and further challenge the [[potential_consequences_for_chinas_economy_due_to_oil_supply_disruptions | Chinese economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.

The **shifting power balances in the Pacific Ocean** are significantly influenced by recent developments in US weapon systems, particularly following the demise of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. While there is public concern about China's greater number of ships (370-620 compared to the US's 250-300), the more critical factor is the range and capability of weapon systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. Most Chinese vessels are small, typically a couple thousand tons, and have limited range; only about 10% can travel more than 1,000 miles, and few have a strike capability beyond a couple thousand miles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. In contrast, America's supercarriers are fully Blue Water capable and can strike targets at considerable distances using aircraft and standoff missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

## New US Weapon System Deployments

By the end of the calendar year, the United States will be deploying two new types of weapon systems in the Pacific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

### Land-Based Intermediate-Range Missiles

The first new system is a land-based intermediate-range missile, which was previously illegal in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.
This is a direct consequence of the 2019 demise of the INF Treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>:

*   **INF Treaty Background** The INF Treaty, signed during the late Cold War, banned land-based missiles with a range between 500 km and 5,500 km <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. Its purpose was to make Europe immune from a blitzkrieg nuclear strike from the [[strategic_and_diplomatic_implications_for_russia | Soviet Union]] and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.
*   **Treaty Demise** The treaty dissolved because the [[strategic_and_diplomatic_implications_for_russia | Russians]] began ignoring it and deploying their own systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>, and the Chinese, who were never signatories, started implementing these systems en masse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
*   **Rapid US Development** The treaty was abrogated in 2019, and these new US weapon systems, first discussed in 2020, are set for implementation by 2024, demonstrating quick development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.
*   **Deployment Locations** The Pentagon is deploying these systems to US territories like Midway and Guam, and likely to Darwin, Australia, but not currently to Japan or the Philippines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. This capability allows the US to launch cruise missiles with ranges in the thousands of kilometers to intercept Chinese shipping routes and naval patrols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>, primarily for land attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

### Maritime-Targeting Tomahawk Cruise Missiles

The second development is a version of the Tomahawk cruise missile, primarily for submarines, that can now target maritime vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

*   **Tomahawk Capabilities** First debuted in the 1992 Gulf War, Tomahawks are smart weapons capable of following a GPS map to target objects over a thousand miles away with a half-ton warhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. Most vessels cannot withstand more than one hit from such a weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.
*   **Targeting Advancements** While previous targeting for moving ships was problematic, new capabilities use satellite GPS information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
*   **US vs. China Targeting** China's ballistic missiles, designed for US naval targets, rely on satellite reconnaissance, but they lack active eyes on their missiles, making them blind if the target moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. The US, in contrast, has a sophisticated satellite warfare system, demonstrated in 2008 when it quietly took out multiple old satellites using various weapon programs after China destroyed its first satellite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. This served as a warning to China that its satellite network would be neutralized in a hot war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.
*   **AI Integration** The US has a more well-rounded approach to AI, including in weapon systems, allowing for independent decision-making that is not permitted in China, where AI development is tightly controlled for social monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>. This technology is likely integrated into the new Tomahawk version, enabling it to target moving surface ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic Impact** By the end of next year, the quietest and longest-range US submarines will be equipped with Tomahawks capable of targeting naval vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. In a hot war, two or three American missile submarines could effectively neutralize China's Long Reach Navy by targeting their long-range ships, preventing anything else from leaving the coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.

## Political Context of Development Delays

The delay in developing these capabilities, despite the Tomahawk dating back to 1992 and medium-range cruise missiles being worked on until the late 1980s, is attributed to political factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.

*   **Clinton Administration (Post-Cold War)** During the early post-Cold War era, the focus was on building friendships, so developing weapons to target potential friends made little sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.
*   **W. Bush Administration (Middle East Focus)** While relations with [[strategic_and_diplomatic_implications_for_russia | Russia]] and China began to sour, the W. Bush administration was preoccupied with conflicts in the Islamic world, especially operations in Afghanistan, where [[strategic_and_diplomatic_implications_for_russia | Russia]] was a more reliable partner for logistics than Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.
*   **Obama Administration (Lack of Engagement)** By the Obama administration, [[strategic_and_diplomatic_implications_for_russia | Russia]] had started invading other nations, and China was engaged in rampant intellectual property theft and government hacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>. However, President Obama did not prioritize these issues and viewed the US military as an "enemy," limiting its empowerment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.
*   **Trump Administration (Strategic Incompetence)** The Trump administration's approach did not facilitate updates to strategic doctrine or new weapon systems, leading to a period of "strategic incompetence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>.
*   **Biden Administration (Experienced Decision-Making)** Firm decision-making on these developments only occurred under Joe Biden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>. His long political career meant he remembered these systems from the 1980s and the adoption of the INF treaty, providing the necessary context for political decisions to order their development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>. This has led to more robust and forward-looking security decision-making than seen since George H.W. Bush in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Summary
> The expiry of the INF Treaty, coupled with new US weapon deployments and advanced targeting capabilities, significantly alters the power balance in the Pacific. This strategic shift, driven by a renewed focus on great power competition, means that long-held assumptions about US military capability and geopolitical responses must be re-evaluated by rivals.

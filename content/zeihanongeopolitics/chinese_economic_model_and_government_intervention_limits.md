China is currently facing a "triple economic funk," displaying economic behaviors not seen in most other countries post-COVID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Unlike nearly every other nation that experienced an explosion in consumption and inflation after lockdowns ended, China has not seen this recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Current Economic Indicators

Growth in China is now lower than it was during the full lockdown period over the last two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Consumption is down, and both imports and exports dropped by double-digit percentages in July compared to the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Such declines are typically only observed in countries experiencing war, like Ukraine or Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Underlying Problems

### Demographic Challenges
A "demographic bomb" began to go off in China as early as 2017, predating the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. From 2017 to 2021, the birth rate plummeted by approximately 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Even before COVID, new car sales, a key indicator of population confidence and spending, started to decline and have not recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The long-term effects of the One-Child Policy, which ended over 40 years ago, mean that there is now a full generation of people who did not have children, leading to a significant lack of individuals in their 20s and 30sâ€”the primary consumer demographic for cars, homes, and raising families in a modern system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Deflation
Unlike the inflationary trends seen in the United States, Europe, and most of the developing world post-COVID, China is experiencing deflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This is because the anticipated consumption boom never materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Instead, reduced consumer confidence has led to decreased consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

Additionally, mounting trade wars from Europe, Japan, the United States, and increasingly, countries like Korea, mean fewer markets for Chinese exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This has resulted in products typically produced for export being trapped within the Chinese system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. The combination of an oversupply of goods and an under-demand, both domestically and internationally, leads to falling prices and deflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. This scenario indicates the beginning of a deflationary spiral caused by a fundamental mismatch between supply and demand, exacerbated by deglobalization and irreversible Chinese demographic trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

### The [[chinese_statecentric_economic_system | Chinese State-Centric Economic System]] and Limits of Intervention
The [[chinese_statecentric_economic_system | Chinese economic system]] is not primarily based on exports or consumption; it is fundamentally an [[chinas_capital_intensive_investment_model | investment model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. The state encourages massive borrowing to construct industrial plants, infrastructure, and other assets, which accounts for 40% to 70% of the entire Chinese economy and has driven the vast majority of its growth for the past 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

However, this model has reached its limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. There is a point where a country no longer needs more bridges or factories, and China arguably reached this point before COVID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Further government spending is unlikely to be effective, as the marginal outcome per Yuan spent has been steadily declining for 40 years, now yielding less than one-to-one returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Pumping more capital into the system will not generate more economic activity than its cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

This situation mirrors Japan's experience in the late 1990s and early 2000s, where their economic model ceased to be effective, leading to negative returns on investments and 20-25 years of deflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. However, Japan had advantages China lacks:
*   An existing global supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>
*   Global allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>
*   Options for offshoring manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>
*   Strong demand from the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>
*   A strong political relationship with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>
*   Most crucially, Japan was already rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

In contrast, the average Chinese citizen's income today is only about a quarter or a fifth of the average Japanese citizen's income in 2000, in inflation-adjusted terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. China is entering a permanent recession and deflationary spiral long before achieving widespread wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

The political system in China, largely centered around a single "Cult of Personality," severely limits the state's capacity to devise creative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Even in Japan, where public discussion was permitted, it took a generation and alliances to recover from deflation, neither of which China currently possesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. If these trends prove consistent, the situation is expected to worsen significantly due to years of accumulated damage now manifesting simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

On April 27th, 2023, news broke that the [[irans_political_objectives_and_actions | Iranians]] had seized an oil tanker named the Advantage Suite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The vessel is a Suez Max oil tanker, estimated to be carrying approximately 800,000 barrels of crude oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The Advantage Suite is owned by a Turkish company and registered in the Marshall Islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## United States Response and Policy Shift

The U.S. Navy issued a press release condemning the action, stating "bad [[irans_political_objectives_and_actions | Iran]] very very bad around" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. However, this response highlights a significant change in U.S. foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

The United States "just doesn't care anymore" about international energy markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Any party wishing to address [[irans_political_objectives_and_actions | Iran's]] seizure of tankers will need to do so without U.S. intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Historical Context

Historically, the U.S. adopted a post-World War II global strategy of protecting resource and product flows, particularly for its allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This policy allowed allies to reduce their military needs and focus on economic development, while the U.S. maintained control over their militaries in case of confrontation, specifically with the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. It is important to note that the U.S. has never imported a significant amount of oil from the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Current Stance

With the decline of the Soviet Union and the diminished global position of modern Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, successive U.S. administrations (Obama, Trump, Biden) have steadily reduced the American commitment to upholding the maritime order that underpins global trade and energy markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Consequently, the U.S. has no interest in maintaining the civilian freedom of the seas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The U.S. is now self-sufficient in energy within North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Implications for Global Powers

This shift in U.S. policy poses a significant challenge for countries like China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. China's economic existence and strategic position depend on the assumption that the U.S. will continue to uphold the freedom of the seas, regardless of other geopolitical actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

In the event of a meaningful interruption to international energy flows, the United States would likely close its borders to energy trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. China, being at the end of a long supply line it cannot protect, would face de-industrialization, potentially leading to the end of its unified nation-state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

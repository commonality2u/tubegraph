This article explores the anticipated state of the former Soviet space, primarily focusing on the Russian territory, in the aftermath of a potential Russian collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. While a collapse is not expected in the immediate future (this year or next year), it is projected to occur within the speaker's lifetime, following a political break and leadership struggle within Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Technology and Military Assets

In a post-collapse scenario, the transferability of Russian military technology to other powers would be very limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Russia's capacity to produce advanced military hardware at scale has been shown to be woefully lacking, with only one advanced tank or a dozen advanced jets produced in the last 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

The ability of other nations to copy advanced Russian technology is also limited, as countries with the necessary technical skills (e.g., Poland, Ukraine, Czech Republic, Hungary) prefer to work with more effective Western technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Furthermore, Russian industrial plants are highly inefficient and cannot be adequately staffed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Most military hardware is expected to fade away quickly, especially as current stock is being expended in the Ukraine war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## Human Capital and Skilled Labor

Despite significant population losses from emigration and war casualties, Russia still retains a number of individuals with technical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. However, unlike the post-Soviet collapse when around 10 million Russians with advanced degrees left the country, the current pool of such individuals is much smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This is due to the collapse of the Russian technical educational system, which was never rebuilt post-Soviet era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Therefore, any future outflow of skilled labor, though noticeable, would not be as dramatic as previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

### Intelligence Services

A similar, though less impactful, exodus of intelligence personnel into criminal enterprises is anticipated, reflecting a reality seen in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. However, the current pool of such individuals is smaller and less technically skilled compared to the past, being more akin to "thugs of Syria" than the FBI technocrats of 40 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Their skills are less marketable in a post-collapse environment due to the Putin regime's reliance on loyalty over meritocracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

## Resource Extraction and Agriculture

Russia is an immensely resource-rich country, but vast swathes of its territory are empty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. The population has increasingly concentrated in Moscow and St. Petersburg, leading to the depopulation of the countryside and secondary cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

### Agriculture

Russian agriculture is divided into two main types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>:
*   **80% Old Soviet-style farms:** These are highly inefficient and rely on local inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **20% Enterprise Farms:** These are more productive, generate significant income, and are often on the best land, but they are entirely dependent on internationalized supply chains and Western equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

A significant drop in food production is expected if Russia's system loses coherence and these "Enterprise Farms" can no longer access necessary international inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. While not necessarily leading to widespread famine, it will exacerbate existing distribution issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

### Mineral Resources

The extraction of Russia's vast mineral resources will face dire challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Most valuable minerals (nickel, palladium, platinum, gold, oil) are located in remote, harsh environments like the high Arctic or Eastern Siberia, far from population centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The necessary industrial maintenance and Western technology to extract these materials are difficult for Russians to manage on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

Any future production would likely require foreign powers to invest capital, technology, and security, effectively running "neo-colonial" operations in challenging environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. However, this is unlikely for most areas, as dependence on a connection to a remaining Russian government would complicate such ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Only extremities like Sakhalin Island or select parts of East Siberia might continue to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

## Ethnic Minorities and Regional Autonomy

Russia's official statistics indicate that 20% of its population is non-ethnic Russian, with Turkic minorities being the largest group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. In the event of a significant Russian collapse, many of these groups are likely to seek independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Groups to watch include those near borders with potential foreign sponsors or those on key infrastructure/transport corridors, enabling them to exert influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

### Tatars and Bashkirs

These groups, located northwest of Kazakhstan, control critical infrastructure connecting Russia and Siberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. Their secession would effectively sever Siberia from the rest of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. They also possess significant energy reserves and have retained their technical expertise after the Soviet era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

### Caucasus Groups

The Caucasus region, including the Chechens, is a key area for potential secession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. Turkey, with its historical sponsorship of Chechen wars, is a country to watch, as many of these minorities are Turkic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. A breakup in the North Caucasus would severely impact Russia's control over the region and negatively affect Ukraine due to shared population bands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

### Finno-Ugric Minorities and Scandinavia

In the extreme Northwest, a number of Finno-Ugric minorities exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. Finland, which Russia attacked in World War II and absorbed significant Finnish territory, has recently abandoned its neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. Both Finland and Sweden have emerged as aggressive allies within the Western Alliance, possessing robust military traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

A Russian state collapse is highly likely to see a new wave of Scandinavian influence, possibly reclaiming lost lands and expanding their sphere into the Russian space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. This historical precedent, including Viking foundations of Kiev and Moscow, suggests significant regional shifts are possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

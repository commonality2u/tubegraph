China is facing significant challenges that could lead to its dissolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, primarily due to its unique [[chinas_demographic_challenges | demographic]] and economic vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Demographic Decline
China is described as "pioneering national dissolution" [[demographic_and_economic_challenges_facing_china | demographically]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Its birth rate has been lower than that of the United States since the early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Currently, China has approximately the same number of people over age 50 as under age 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This trend is expected to lead to the ethnic dissolution of the Han ethnicity before the end of this century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, raising questions about the viability of a country without its people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The long-term future of China is framed as "a question of how China dies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Economic Dependencies and Vulnerabilities
China's [[chinas_economic_strategies_and_challenges | economic]] model faces severe structural challenges:
*   **Reliance on Imports** The country imports almost all of its energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, nearly all components required to grow its own food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, and almost all of its raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Export-Oriented Manufacturing** China is entirely dependent on exports to the wider world to absorb its massive manufacturing capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Globalization Dependence** It is the country most dependent on globalization in absolute terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This dependence extends to relying on the U.S. military to ensure its ships can travel unmolested globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This strategy is considered a "bad business strategy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

These factors suggest that the Chinese system and potentially the Chinese state could face an end within 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

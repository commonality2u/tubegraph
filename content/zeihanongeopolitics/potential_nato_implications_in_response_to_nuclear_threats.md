Recent political developments in the United States indicate a growing concern regarding [[russian_nuclear_threat_and_western_response | Russia's potential use of nuclear weapons]] or actions impacting nuclear facilities in Ukraine, and the subsequent implications for [[nato_and_regional_powers_response_to_russian_influence | NATO]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>

## US Senators' Joint Resolution

On June 22nd, Senators Blumenthal (Democrat, Connecticut) and Graham (Republican, South Carolina) introduced a joint resolution. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a> This resolution states that any direct or indirect use of strategic or tactical nuclear weapons by Russia or Belarus, or any actions causing a meltdown at a nuclear power plant (like the Zaporizhzhia Power Plant, which satellite photos indicate Russia has mined its coolant pump), <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a> would be considered an act of war under [[natos_response_to_russia_and_china | Article 5 of NATO]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>

The intent behind this resolution is to warn not only Vladimir Putin but also those who would carry out such orders. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a> The message is that following these orders would not merely cause a nuclear catastrophe within Ukraine, but would be perceived by the United States and its allies as an act of war, thereby initiating a direct military conflict with the United States and its allies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>

### Limitations of the Resolution

While significant in its intent, the resolution faces several limitations:
*   **Executive Privilege** The interpretation of Article 5 is an executive privilege, not something Congress can legally dictate. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>
*   **Non-Binding** A joint resolution is a statement of intent, not a law, and therefore carries no legal weight. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>
*   **Allied Decision** Article 5 decisions are made among all [[natos_response_to_russia_and_china | NATO]] allies, not unilaterally by the United States. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>

Despite these limitations, the senators' initiative is seen as crucial for initiating a necessary conversation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>

## Russian Perspective and Nuclear Escalation Risk

Russia has considered Crimea an integral part of its territory since its annexation in 2014. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a> Any military push towards Crimea by Ukrainian forces is viewed by Russia as crossing a "gray zone," potentially leading them to consider it a "real war" where the use of "defensive nuclear weapons" might be warranted. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a> This perspective highlights the severe [[impact_of_nuclear_escalation_risk_on_military_involvement | impact of nuclear escalation risk on military involvement]].

> "No country in the world has recognized the annexation of Crimea by the Russians... it doesn't matter what we think, it matters what the Russians think and whether or not they're going to treat Crimea like Moscow." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>

Furthermore, if Ukraine aims to win the war, it may eventually need to cross into internationally recognized Russian territory to target logistical hubs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a> This scenario would again bring the question of defensive nuclear weapons into play. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>

## Strategic Nuclear Policy Discussions

The senators' action is vital for beginning a long-overdue national conversation in the United States on [[strategic_nuclear_policy_discussions_involving_the_united_states | strategic nuclear policy discussions involving the United States]] vis-a-vis Russia, a topic largely untouched since the 1980s. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>

[!INFO] President Biden's extensive experience with nuclear policy, having witnessed the entire arc of nuclear policy in the country since the first nuclear weapon detonation, positions him uniquely to lead these critical discussions in the coming months. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>

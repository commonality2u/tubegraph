Russia faces significant challenges due to its extensive and exposed geography, compounded by severe demographic issues. These factors contribute to a precarious long-term outlook for the nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Geographic Vulnerabilities
Russia's geography is highly exposed, featuring 5,000 miles of external border that lacks significant natural geographic barriers for defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This means the country has to defend its entire perimeter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

A primary motivation behind the Ukraine War, in part, was to expand westward and reach the former Soviet-era external defense lines, which included geographic barriers like the Tien Shan Mountains or the Carpathians, thus shortening the defensible border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Ironically, if Russia does not expand, it cannot effectively shorten its external barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Despite the loss of all 14 constituent republics from the Soviet system, present-day Russia has a longer external border on a map than the Soviet Union did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This situation presents a significant [[russian_geographic_and_strategic_military_objectives | strategic military objective]] and vulnerability for Russia.

## Demographic Challenges
Data on [[russias_demographic_challenges | Russian demography]] is less clear than for China, partly because Russia ceased collecting census data 17 years ago and has since fabricated official figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. At the time they stopped collecting data, Russia's demographic structure was among the worst globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Even based on their official, fabricated data, Russia's demographic situation ranks in the bottom 10 worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. These [[demographic_issues_in_russia | demographic issues in Russia]] suggest that the nation's long-term viability is questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

While Russia is not in as dire a situation as China regarding its immediate collapse, it is not an economic power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Furthermore, Russia cannot even sustain its raw materials exports without external assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

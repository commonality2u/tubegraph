Donald Trump has expressed a willingness to use military force in Greenland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. However, an analysis of the existing relationship and potential consequences suggests such an action would be detrimental to [[american_interests_and_responses | American interests]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

## Current US Presence and Danish Alliance
The United States already maintains a significant military operation in Greenland, a legacy of the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This presence is primarily used to help patrol the North Atlantic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

Denmark, which administers and owns Greenland, is regarded as one of the most creative and loyal US allies, ranking among the top five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Unlike some other allies, Denmark does not exhibit the same level of ego as the French or Germans, or even the British <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. They have consistently supported the United States in desired ways, caring for Greenland and granting the US unlimited access for military purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## Implications of Military Action in Greenland
While the US could militarily conquer Greenland, which has a population of less than 50,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, such a move would offer no strategic gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The US already receives all necessary benefits from Greenland under the current arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### Strategic Setbacks
An occupation would necessitate US administration of Greenland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a> and severely damage relations with Denmark, a key ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Denmark's control over access between the Baltic Sea and the North Sea makes their alliance crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Disrupting this relationship would jeopardize a potentially strong future alliance involving the United States, the UK, the Netherlands, Scandinavians (Sweden, Denmark, Norway), and Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Such an action would poison a relationship with a geographically significant ally, thereby endangering future strategic positions against adversaries in Northwest Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### Conclusion
A military action against an ally like Denmark would result in the loss of that ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a> and would shatter the [[shift_in_us_global_strategic_role | American strategic position]] in northern Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>, making the US more reliant on less cooperative countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. It would not yield any meaningful security gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

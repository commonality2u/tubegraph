Following the recent [[presidential_debate_analysis | presidential debate]], observations were made regarding Joe Biden's performance and his overall cognitive condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Debate Performance Observations

During the debate, Joe Biden "did not have a good day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. He appeared confused, somewhat lost, and it was unclear if he knew his exact location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Many of his responses, particularly in the early part of the debate, were described as "almost nonsensical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## The State of Delusion

The speaker states that the term for what is occurring with Joe Biden is that "his mind is diluting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This means he is "losing control of the contact between the context of his memories and his life and the reality about him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This condition makes him slow and confused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This is not a new development but has been escalating "with greater rapidity" in various settings, including press conferences, the Oval Office, and briefings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

While individuals experiencing this condition may have "good days and there are bad days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, for an 81-year-old, the number of bad days tends to "overwhelm the number of good days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Fitness for Office

The speaker concludes that Joe Biden is "no longer fit for office" and "shouldn't be running for president" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. A vote for him is seen as a "vote against National stability in the United States" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This perspective reiterates that the individual at the top needs to be "capable and conscious and cognizant," which Biden is no longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## Impact on the [[2024_us_presidential_election_predictions | 2024 US Presidential Election]]

The speaker's assessment for the [[2024_us_presidential_election_predictions | 2024 US Presidential Election]] suggests that it is "Biden's election no matter what happens as long as he remains alive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

### The Role of Independent Voters

The term "Independents" refers to the "true vote Splitters," a group of about 10% of the electorate who historically decide American elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. These voters are not enthusiastic about either candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Given the choice between "someone deluded" (referring to Biden) and "someone whose dementia will destroy your ability to vote from the future" (referring to Donald Trump), the speaker believes it's "a no contest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

Crucially, since there are more registered Democrats than Republicans, Biden does not necessarily need to win the independent vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. If Independents are simply too "disgusted with both" candidates to show up, this effectively results in a "victory for Biden" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Potential for Biden to Step Down

There is a consideration for Joe Biden to step down, allowing a more capable candidate to run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. If Biden were to willingly step down, it could lead to an "open convention" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

However, the Democratic Party faces challenges in generating new political talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, partly attributed to Barack Obama's presidency which allegedly "sucked all the oxygen out of the room and prevented a new generation of political leaders from rising up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. This has left the party with older power brokers and a limited pool of ready presidential candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

An open convention, while potentially bringing forward "ideological idiots" like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, also offers the possibility of nominating "normal politicians" such as governors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. A strong gubernatorial candidate could potentially lead to a "complete blowout" for the Democrats in the election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. However, there's also the risk of selecting a candidate like Elizabeth Warren, who is viewed as one of very few individuals Donald Trump could defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

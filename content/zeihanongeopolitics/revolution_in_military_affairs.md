The concept of a "Revolution in Military Affairs" (RMA) describes a significant change in military theory and practice. The first phase of this revolution occurred in the 1990s and 2000s, while a second, ongoing phase is now fundamentally transforming modern warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Phase One: Precision and Information Dominance

The initial [[us_military_strategy_and_current_status | military strategy]] revolution took place in the 1990s and 2000s when the United States began to integrate [[role_of_information_technology_in_modern_warfare | information Technologies]] with its military capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This integration involved combining sensors and targeting informationâ€”whether delivered by ordinance, satellite, or attached directly to the weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

Key outcomes of this phase included:
*   **Precision Guidance**: Technologies like Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) and Tomahawk cruise missiles enabled explosive ordinance to be delivered with high accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Reduced Collateral Damage**: Instead of carpet bombing, as was common in earlier conflicts like Vietnam, one or two precision weapons could now hit a specific target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **Hypersonics**: There was initial speculation that marrying precision weapons with hypersonics would eliminate all previous rules of warfare, allowing a handful of such weapons to defend everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. However, challenges like jamming and the sheer scale of conventional forces (e.g., 100,000 infantrymen instead of a single tank) meant the math for widespread hypersonic dominance didn't work out, primarily due to their high cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Phase Two: Democratization of Technology

The current second phase of the RMA involves the democratization of the application of these advanced technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Rather than being controlled exclusively from a central command (like the White House or a general's chair), individual soldiers are gaining command of this information and can use it to autonomously target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

This shift is most aggressively observed in [[ukraine_war_and_military_innovation | Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Ukrainian Drone Strategy

The [[ukraine_war_and_military_innovation | Ukrainians]] are currently employing a four-part [[strategic_changes_in_ukrainian_military_tactics | strategy]] leveraging drone technologies:

1.  **Naval Drone Attacks**: [[ukraine_war_and_military_innovation | Ukrainians]] are attaching hundreds of pounds of explosives to modified jet skis and sending them to target Russian naval vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This has been highly effective, making the western half of the Black Sea a no-go zone for the Russian fleet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. A key advantage for [[ukraine_war_and_military_innovation | Ukraine]] is that most large Russian ships' deck-mounted weapons are designed to hit targets at or above the horizon, preventing them from angling down to strike small boats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

2.  **Mass-Produced Anti-Personnel Drones**: Due to challenges in receiving conventional aid like artillery shells from the American Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, [[ukraine_war_and_military_innovation | Ukrainians]] have begun mass-producing very small drones, each carrying about a pound of payload (the size of a small grenade) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. These are deployed in swarms against Russian "human wave tactics," effectively dropping grenades into mass infantry formations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. In the Battle of Avdiivka, [[ukraine_war_and_military_innovation | Ukrainians]] reportedly inflicted 8:1 to 10:1 casualty ratios on the Russians despite lacking artillery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

3.  **Mid-Range Infrastructure Strikes**: [[ukraine_war_and_military_innovation | Ukraine]] developed drones called the Scythe and the Beaver for mid-range infrastructure strikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The Beaver is technologically superior with longer range and better avionics, while the Scythe is a more rudimentary "garage project" made partially of plywood, with less range but still carrying a decent warhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. These drones are used to target infrastructure within a few hundred kilometers of the front line, including Russian refineries and fuel depots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

4.  **Deep Strikes with Phoenix Ghost**: The United States has provided the Phoenix Ghost drone, which carries a small warhead (5-15 lbs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Its modular design allows one soldier to carry and assemble it easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Initially used against armored vehicles and supply trucks, [[ukraine_war_and_military_innovation | Ukrainians]] quickly realized its potential for deep strikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Because Phoenix Ghost drones provide a live visual feed to the controller, they can strike within a couple of feet of their target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. [[ukraine_war_and_military_innovation | Ukrainian]] Special Forces are likely using these U.S.-made drones deep within Russian territory to attack unprotected targets, such as refinery distillation towers, which are critical and highly flammable parts of the facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
    *   These refinery attacks have significantly impacted Russian refining capacity, taking offline between half a million and a million barrels per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
    *   Repairing this damage is difficult for Russians due to a lack of trained engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
    *   This disruption interrupts a crucial income flow for Russia, typically accounting for about 8% of government revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Destroying processing capacity can lead to crude oil having nowhere to go, potentially causing pressure build-ups in pipelines and even forcing production shut-ins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

This combination of strategic, naval, infantry, and economic warfare, largely enabled by [[ukraine_war_and_military_innovation | Ukrainian]]-born drone technologies, was not thought possible just three months prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

## Historical Parallels and Future Implications

The current developments in [[ukraine_war_and_military_innovation | Ukraine]] evoke parallels to the American Civil War and the Crimean campaign of the 1850s, where early industrial warfare was observed by various nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Many countries are now sending observers to [[ukraine_war_and_military_innovation | Ukraine]], recognizing that this represents a fundamentally new technological breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

While the first phase of the RMA transformed the U.S. Cold War defense industry into a force with extreme range and precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, the second phase maintains this precision but marries it with individual decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. This means tens of thousands of individual weapon platforms can be launched rapidly and are decentralized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. The ability for individuals to target enemy formations at scale across a thousand-mile front, and even hundreds of miles behind it, is unprecedented in military history, and its full transformative impact is only just beginning to be understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

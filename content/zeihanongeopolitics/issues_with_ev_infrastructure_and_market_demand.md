Major auto manufacturers are currently scaling back their plans for electric vehicle (EV) production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Both Ford and GM have canceled plans to build new facilities for battery and EV assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Tesla has indicated a significant drawdown in its global production capacity and is considering suspending or canceling plans for a Gigafactory in Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Fundamental Challenges Facing EVs

Several issues contribute to these setbacks, indicating that EVs may not be a viable solution for the [[environmental_impact_of_electric_vehicles | green transition]] given current conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

### Environmental Impact and Manufacturing Concerns
From an [[environmental_impact_of_electric_vehicles | environmental point of view]], most EVs are at best questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Manufacturing Energy Mix**: The fabrication of EVs involves exotic materials and energy-intensive processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Much of this work is done in China, often using soft coal or lignite, leading to an order of magnitude more carbon generated during production compared to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Recharging Energy Mix**: Claims of EVs being "slam dunk successes" environmentally often assume manufacturing with a clean energy mix and recharging with 100% green energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. In the United States, this ideal scenario does not occur anywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Even in California, the "cleanest" state, 50% of energy still comes from fossil fuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Carbon Break-Even**: EVs typically do not break even on carbon emissions within a year; for most, it approaches 10 years or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### Material Requirements
EVs require significantly more [[material_requirements_for_ev_manufacturing | materials]] like copper, molybdenum, [[lithium_processing_and_supply_chain_requirements | lithium]], and graphite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Supply Shortages**: There are insufficient amounts of these materials on the planet to convert the world's vehicle fleets to EVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Production Scaling Challenges**: Humanity has never doubled the production of any industrial material within a 10-year period, and EVs would require 10 times as much nickel and other resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Achieving such a conversion would likely take decades, possibly a century or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

### [[cost_and_economic_factors_in_the_ev_market | Cost and Affordability]]
The [[cost_and_economic_factors_in_the_ev_market | cost]] of EVs remains a significant barrier for many consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Price Disparity**: An equivalent EV can cost $10,000 to $70,000 more than its internal combustion engine counterpart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This makes EVs unaffordable for the majority of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Infrastructure Limitations
The existing electrical infrastructure is insufficient to support a widespread EV adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Charging Stations**: There are not enough charging stations to alleviate "range anxiety," which is a real concern for EV users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Electricity Generation and Throughput**: To support a nationwide EV program, the United States would need to increase its electricity generation and throughput by approximately half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Since the 1960s, the U.S. has only increased electricity generation by more than 3% in one year (following COVID-19, without new infrastructure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Equipment and Buildout**: This expansion would require a buildout similar to the country's initial electrification in the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. It would also demand about 20 times more equipment, such as transformers and cables, than has been produced in the last 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Even if facilities to build this equipment started today, they would not be ready at scale for four years, and the subsequent buildout would take another decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## Declining Market Demand

Despite the technical and logistical hurdles, the most immediate issue is declining sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Consumer Aversion**: People are losing interest in EVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. They are perceived as less reliable, lacking sufficient range, and consumers are generally nervous about the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Depreciation of Technology**: As new EV models are introduced, older models quickly depreciate, and consumers are reluctant to pay high prices for rapidly outdated technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Unsold Inventory**: EVs are accumulating on dealership lots, unlike ICE vehicles whose lots are often empty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **Profitability Issues**: To move inventory, massive discounts are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. These discounts have rendered the entire EV industry unprofitable, even with subsidies from the Inflation Reduction Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

Only 1% of the American vehicle fleet has been converted to EVs, and this adoption may be nearing its peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. The argument is that limited capital, resources, [[material_requirements_for_ev_manufacturing | material inputs]], and labor should be focused on [[future_prospects_for_battery_technology_and_material_science_research | green transition]] technologies that are more viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

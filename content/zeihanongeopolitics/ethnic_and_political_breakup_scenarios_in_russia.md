Peter Zeihan anticipates a Russian collapse within his lifetime, though not in the immediate future (this year, next year, or this decade) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This expectation is based on the country's [[demographic_issues_in_russia | horrid demographics]] and the ongoing war in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Forecasting a Russian Collapse

A [[potential_scenarios_for_putins_removal_or_assassination | political break in Russia]] is necessary for a collapse, specifically the failure of the Putin regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Since Vladimir Putin has largely removed anyone capable of replacing him, a leadership struggle and likely civil conflict could lead to a national collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This scenario is not considered imminent unless there's a massive military defeat in Ukraine in the near term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

The post-Russian space will be shaped by the country's [[demographic_challenges_facing_russia | demographic collapse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Consequences of Collapse

When a country or empire collapses, certain elements may persist in new forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Military Technology Dispersal
Russia has historically been a significant military power, especially during the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. However, the Ukraine war has revealed Russia's woeful lack in producing its own advanced military technology at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. For instance, they can only make one advanced tank at a time, and only a dozen advanced jets in the last 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The capacity for this technology to transfer to other powers is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:01:59">[0:01:59]</a>. China lacks the sophistication to copy advanced Russian tech, and countries with the necessary skills (e.g., Poland, Ukraine, Czech Republic, Hungary) prefer Western technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Russia's industrial plants are inefficient and understaffed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Furthermore, Russia is burning through its existing material in the Ukraine war, meaning there won't be a large stock of modern war material available for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Skilled Labor Exodus
Even after a million men fled the country at the start of the war and 300,000 to 800,000 men have been lost since, there are still Russians with technical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Following the Soviet collapse, about 10 million Russians with advanced degrees left the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. A similar exodus is expected, but less dramatic, as Russia's technical educational system collapsed before the Soviet Union and was never rebuilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Only a low single-digit million number of people with relevant skills could theoretically leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

### Intelligence Services and Crime
In the early 1990s, former Russian, Central European, and South African intelligence agents often turned to crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This phenomenon will likely recur, but the pool of personnel is smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Modern Russian security personnel are more akin to "thugs of Syria" than FBI technocrats, lacking signals intelligence skills or global connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Putin's system, based on loyalty rather than meritocracy, produces less marketable skills for those who might go into business for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### [[russias_geographic_and_demographic_exposure | Russia's Geographic and Demographic Exposure]]
Russia is arguably the most resource-rich country in human history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. However, huge swathes of its territory are empty, more so than during Soviet times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Post-Soviet collapse, people have moved from the countryside to secondary cities, and then from secondary cities to Moscow and St. Petersburg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. This has resulted in only about 5% of the country having a reasonable population density, with Moscow and St. Petersburg being larger than ever while other areas shrink into obscurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

#### Agricultural Impact
Removing the structures supporting civilization will likely cause large parts of current Russian agricultural areas to stop producing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Russian farms are largely divided into 80% inefficient, input-intensive Soviet-style operations and 20% "Enterprise Farms" using Western equipment and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. While the Enterprise Farms are far more productive and generate more income, they are dependent on international supply chains and are not typically located near the country's borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. If Russia breaks down, these farms will cease functioning or revert to old methods, leading to a significant drop in food production capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. This may lead to distribution issues, a historical Russian problem, potentially constraining the ability to maintain even a smaller population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

#### Mineral Output Decline
Russia's mineral output will face dire straits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Most valuable minerals like nickel, palladium, and platinum are in remote, harsh Arctic regions (e.g., Kola Peninsula, Norilsk) or Eastern Siberia (gold), while oil is in the permafrost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The infrastructure required for extraction and maintenance is complex and often needs Western technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Russia's collapsed educational system means only a few dozen Russian nationals trained abroad are currently maintaining this infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

Any play for Russian production would require a [[role_of_foreign_powers_in_russia_after_a_collapse | foreign power]] to provide capital, technology, and security, essentially running a "neo-colonial" operation in extreme environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. If infrastructure depends on links back to Russian proper, the remaining Russian government would retain influence, making such operations unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Only resources on the extremities, like Sakhalin Island or select areas in East Siberia, might remain functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Extracting resources from places like Eastern Siberia would require building supply chains through air-supplied areas, which is highly challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

### [[ethnic_tensions_within_the_russian_federation | Ethnic Tensions and Breakup]]
Official Russian statistics, which may overestimate cohesion, claim 20% of the population is non-ethnic Russian, with Turkic minorities being the largest group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. These minorities are concentrated in Western Siberia (Germans, Ukrainians), and the South (Tatars, Bashkirs, Chechens, Ingush) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

If the Russian system breaks, many of these groups will likely seek independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. The groups to watch are those near borders with foreign sponsors or on key infrastructure/transport corridors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

#### Key Ethnic Groups to Watch
*   **Tatars and Bashkirs**: Located northwest of Kazakhstan, they control infrastructure connecting Russia and Siberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Their breakaway would sever Siberia from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. They also possess significant energy reserves and technical knowledge for production, making them technically capable of self-governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. Unlike other regions, their technical populace largely remained after the Soviet collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.
*   **Caucasus Groups**: Groups like the Chechens are close to external borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Turkey, which was active in sponsoring the Chechen wars, would likely be interested in expanding its influence into the Caucasus, as many minorities there are Turkic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. If Russian republics on the north side of the Caucasus Mountains become independent, it would break Russia's control over the Caucasus and negatively impact Ukraine due to shared population bands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Finno-Ugric Minorities**: In the extreme Northwest, a number of Finno-Ugric minorities reside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. Finland, historically attacked by Russia (USSR) and having lost territory (housing a quarter of its population) after World War II, has become an aggressive ally of the United States since joining the Western Alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Scandinavia, including Sweden, has a robust and current military tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. A Russian state collapse is expected to lead to a new iteration of Scandinavian "Vikings" moving into the Russian space, in many cases to reclaim lost land, and potentially for broader influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. The historical links between Vikings and the founding of Kiev and Moscow, and Sweden's decisive conflict in Ukraine during its empire's fall, suggest that the Ukraine war has profoundly impacted Stockholm and Helsinki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

The United States is considering significant changes to its foreign policy in the Middle East, potentially impacting its long-standing relationship with [[Impact of Israel and South Koreas involvement | Israel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. A key indicator of this potential shift is the Biden Administration's public commitment to building a floating dock to facilitate humanitarian aid into Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

## Humanitarian Crisis in Gaza

Gaza is described as an open-air prison camp, completely dependent on aid as it grows no food itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. Following the October [[Israel and Hamas conflict overview | Hamas attacks on Israel]], which resulted in approximately 1,600 deaths, the [[Israels defense and political response | Israeli counter effort]] to eliminate Hamas has devastated Gaza, destroying an estimated two-thirds of its housing stock and much of its infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.

An upcoming assault on the southern part of the strip, targeting the remnants of Hamas, is expected to further worsen the humanitarian situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. Approximately 35,000 Gazans have already died, representing over 1% of the pre-war civilian population, and a Rafa attack could double this casualty count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. This makes it the highest-casualty conflict in recent years outside of Sub-Saharan Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. Due to the conflict, [[Political dynamics in Israel | Israel]] has largely blockaded entrances to Gaza, making aid delivery extremely challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

## The Floating Dock Initiative

The proposed floating dock aims to provide at least 2 million meals a day, meeting roughly one-third of the territory's food demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. However, this initiative faces significant obstacles:
*   **Logistics:** Delivering aid on this scale requires a logistics team using small boats and, crucially, "boots on the ground" in Gaza to establish a truck distribution system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.
*   **Military Presence:** The UN cannot operate in Gaza in war, meaning only the U.S. military could manage this operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. This would result in a larger U.S. military presence in and around Gaza than in the rest of the Middle East combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.
*   **Security Risks:** Hamas remains active, and attacks on U.S. forces are anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

## US-Israel Disagreement and Strained Relations

President Biden has a first-name relationship with most Middle Eastern leaders, a dynamic developed during his time as Vice President when he handled regional diplomacy for the Obama administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. Despite this, Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu have a difficult relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. Netanyahu is described as an effective political leader who has hardened his stance during the conflict, prioritizing Israeli national interests, particularly the destruction of Hamas for [[Israels defense and political response | Israeli security]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

The U.S. is attempting to find a "third way" to allow Palestinians to live, but this approach does not align with [[Political dynamics in Israel | Israeli national security]] interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. There is broad [[Political dynamics in Israel | Israeli support]] for the military operation in Gaza across the political spectrum, regardless of civilian casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. The U.S. government is aware of Israel's opposition to a significant U.S. military presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

## Potential Shift in US Foreign Policy

The U.S. decision to proceed with the dock suggests it may be preparing to "breach" the U.S.-Israeli relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. This could lead to a broader U.S. pullout from the entire Middle East, extending the Biden Administration's trend of slimming down U.S. involvement in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>.

Such a disengagement would have significant consequences for current regional alliances:
*   **Existing Alliances:** [[Impact of Israel and South Koreas involvement | Israel]] has successfully built diplomatic relationships with Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, and the UAE, and is close to normalizing relations with [[saudiisrael_normalization_negotiations | Saudi Arabia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. A U.S. withdrawal from [[Impact of Israel and South Koreas involvement | Israel]] would leave these countries to fend for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.
*   **New Partnerships:** If the U.S. seeks to maintain influence post-[[Impact of Israel and South Koreas involvement | Israel]] and [[Israels potential alliances with Turkey and Saudi Arabia | Saudi American position]], the only viable partner is [[Israels potential alliances with Turkey and Saudi Arabia | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. Despite the current Turkish government's dislike for Israelis, [[Israels potential alliances with Turkey and Saudi Arabia | Turkey]] possesses the most powerful military in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>. Renewed diplomatic connections at the assistant defense secretary level have been observed between the Biden and ErdoÄŸan administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>.

This potential shift represents a "game-changing" approach for the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. It could involve reducing relations with [[Impact of Israel and South Koreas involvement | Israel]], [[saudiisrael_normalization_negotiations | Saudi Arabia]], and the UAE, while fostering ties with a more democratic, strategically viable, and capable country like [[Israels potential alliances with Turkey and Saudi Arabia | Turkey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>.

The extent of the Biden Administration's commitment to this plan will become clearer once the floating dock is operational or if a significant shift in American relations with [[Israels potential alliances with Turkey and Saudi Arabia | Turkey]] is observed, likely within the next two to three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

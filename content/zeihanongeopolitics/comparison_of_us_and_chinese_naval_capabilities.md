There is a common perception, sometimes described as paranoid or defeatist, that China possesses more ships than the United States. Depending on how ships are counted, China has between 370 and 620 vessels, while the United States has between 250 and 300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. However, a deeper look at the range and capabilities of their respective weapon systems reveals a different picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Chinese Naval Power

Most Chinese vessels are relatively small, often just a couple of thousand tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. These are types of ships the United States typically avoids fielding due to their vulnerability and limited range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Only about 10% of China's ships can travel more than 1,000 miles, and very few have a strike capability exceeding a couple of thousand miles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

China has also expanded its intermediate-range missile capabilities, with some systems having a range of 500 km to 5,000 km <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. While China utilizes ballistic missiles designed to target US naval assets, a key problem with this strategy is the need for "active eyes" on the missile's flight path, as it cannot adjust on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Chinese reliance on satellite reconnaissance for targeting is hampered by their lack of a sophisticated satellite warfare system comparable to that of the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. A 2008 incident where China destroyed one of its own satellites, creating a debris field, was swiftly followed by the US quietly taking out half a dozen of its old satellites using various weapon programs, demonstrating US superiority in this domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

In terms of artificial intelligence (AI), China's focus is predominantly on social monitoring to maintain population control, which restricts the development of AI that could enable independent decision-making, like advanced AI for weapon systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

## US Naval Power

In contrast, America's supercarriers are fully Blue Water capable, and their aircraft can strike targets at considerable distances, especially with standoff missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

By the end of 2024, the United States will be deploying two new types of weapon systems in the Pacific, significantly enhancing its [[naval_power_in_the_pacific_ocean | naval power in the Pacific Ocean]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>:

### Land-Based Intermediate-Range Missiles

The first new system is a land-based intermediate-range missile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This type of missile was previously illegal in the United States due to the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, signed during the late Cold War. This treaty barred land-based missiles with a range between 500 km and 5,500 km <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The treaty's demise in 2019 occurred because Russia began ignoring it and deploying its own systems, and China, never a signatory, implemented these weapons en masse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

The development of these new US systems has been remarkably swift, with implementation expected by 2024, just five years after the treaty's abrogation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. While the Pentagon is tight-lipped about their exact range, deployment will initially focus on US territories such as Midway and Guam, with potential deployment in Darwin, Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. These missiles will allow the US to launch cruise missiles with thousands of kilometers of range, capable of intersecting any Chinese shipping route or naval patrol, primarily for land attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### Maritime-Targeting Tomahawk Cruise Missiles

The second new system is a version of the Tomahawk cruise missile specifically designed to target maritime vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The Tomahawk, first debuted in the 1991 Gulf War, is a smart weapon capable of following GPS maps to hit targets over a thousand miles away with a half-ton warhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. While previous versions struggled with targeting moving ships, the new variant will leverage satellite GPS information for targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

This enhanced capability likely incorporates advancements in AI, an area where the US has a more well-rounded approach compared to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. By the end of 2024, the world's quietest and longest-range US submarines will carry these Tomahawks, enabling them to target naval vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. In a conflict, deploying just a few American missile submarines could effectively cripple China's ability to project naval power beyond its coastal waters by targeting their limited long-range ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

## Political Context of Development

The relatively slow development of these systems, despite Russia and China's increasingly aggressive stances, has a political dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

*   **Clinton Administration (1990s)**: In the post-Cold War era, with efforts to foster international friendship, developing weapons specifically targeting potential allies was not a priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **W. Bush Administration (early 2000s)**: Although US-Russia and US-China relations began to sour, the administration was preoccupied with conflicts in the Islamic world, especially Afghanistan. Russia was a more reliable partner for logistics in Afghanistan than Pakistan, leading to these developments being back-burnered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   **Obama Administration (2009-2017)**: Despite Russia invading neighboring countries and China engaging in widespread intellectual property theft and hacking, President Obama's perceived disinterest in direct engagement and his unofficial view of the US military as an "enemy" meant little progress for eight years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   **Trump Administration (2017-2021)**: Updates to strategic doctrine and new weapon systems do not align with a governance style reliant on tweets, resulting in strategic incompetence during a period when Russia and China were expanding their influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

It was not until the Biden Administration that firm decision-making on the development and employment of these systems occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. President Biden, having been involved in politics since the 1980s, recalled the context of the INF Treaty and the dawn of the Tomahawk missile, providing the necessary historical perspective for political decisions to order these developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. This has led to more robust and forward-looking security decision-making than seen since the George H.W. Bush administration in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. This shift suggests that China and Russia, who might have relied on perceived American political incompetence, will now face a more assertive US military posture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

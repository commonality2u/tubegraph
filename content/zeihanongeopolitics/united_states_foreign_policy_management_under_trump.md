Former President Donald Trump's approach to foreign policy is characterized by statements and threats that often do not materialize into concrete policy, partly due to his cabinet appointments and personnel management style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Many of his appointees are described as functionally incompetent in their areas, which reduces the likelihood of policies making it into reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Characteristics of Trump's Foreign Policy Management

Trump's cabinet selection process is noted for prioritizing individuals who stroke his ego and make him look good publicly, leading to frequent turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. During his first term, he went through more cabinet-level secretaries than the previous three American presidents combined, limiting the time for meaningful policy discussion, formation, and implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. His personnel management is considered among the worst in modern memory, comparable to Barack Obama's style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

Trump's foreign policy approach often treats individual issues in isolation, failing to account for their interconnectedness within the broader global system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Despite a period where globalization is ending and regionalization decisions are crucial, there has been a perceived lack of leadership to guide or implement these discussions into policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

## Specific Example: The European Energy Proposal

One notable proposal from Trump suggested that European nations should purchase American oil and gas to address their trade deficit with the U.S. and solidify the alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

### Europe's Energy Consumption
Europe, broadly defined to include the Balkans, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the European Union, consumes approximately 13 million barrels of crude oil per day (including refined products) and about 45 billion cubic feet of natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This volume represents roughly 50% to 60% of what the United States consumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. While Europe has a larger population than the U.S., its economy is smaller and less energy-intensive, partly due to ongoing de-industrialization linked to energy, worker, and finance shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### Feasibility of U.S. Supply
From a purely quantitative perspective, the United States could potentially fuel Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. U.S. oil production could expand by two to four million barrels per day within the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. For natural gas, significant liquified natural gas (LNG) export capacity would need to be built, potentially doubling or almost tripling current levels, which is feasible with projects already in the pipeline over the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:02:02]</a>.

### Challenges and Strategic Implications
Despite the numerical feasibility, the proposal faces several challenges:
*   **Diversion of Existing Exports** Sending all U.S. energy exports to Europe would mean diverting them from current destinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Impact on Current Allies** The top destination for U.S. energy exports is Mexico, where roughly half of the electricity is generated by American natural gas, and over a million barrels per day of crude and refined products are sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Japan is the second-largest destination and a tighter ally than many European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Trade Deficit Misconception** Shifting existing sales from one place to another does not inherently address a trade deficit; it merely creates a different set of numbers problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Strategic Considerations for a De-Globalizing World
The true issue is strategic alignment in a world where globalization is ending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. The U.S. must make choices about which allies to prioritize and encourage to continue existing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Europe could be considered a strategic block that keeps Russia contained and offers influence in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Merging North America and Europe into an "American-dominated system that includes the entire cultural West" could form a powerful faction in a de-globalizing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

However, pouring all energy resources into Europe would mean not having them available for other advanced countries like Korea and Japan, or rapidly growing regions like Southeast Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Europe faces a demographic challenge, with regions like Germany's industrial base potentially collapsing within a decade due to a lack of workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Alternatively, supporting countries like Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, Indonesia, or Malaysia might offer a greater "bang for the buck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. As the Eurozone faces problems, the U.S. may choose to work with individual European countries like France, the UK, or Spain, which appear more viable strategically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

While the specific proposal for Europe to buy American energy in isolation is limited, it initiates a necessary conversation about [[shifts_in_us_foreign_policy_and_its_implications | potential shifts in U.S. foreign policy]] and strategic alliances in a changing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

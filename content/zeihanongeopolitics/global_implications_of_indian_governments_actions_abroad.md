Recent accusations against the Indian government regarding an assassination plot on Canadian soil highlight a significant shift in [[Indias international relations and foreign policy | India's foreign policy]] and its global implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## The Alleged Assassination Plot

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly accused the Indian government of assassinating a Sikh immigrant on Canadian soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The individual, a Canadian citizen who had renounced his Indian citizenship, was targeted due to his support for a separatist group in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Although the separatist issue is largely resolved in India's favor, the individual continued to speak about it while abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Intelligence Confirmation

Intelligence reports suggest the accusation is likely true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The intelligence originated from the United States, which possesses superior intelligence capabilities in Canada compared to the Canadian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This information was further verified by the British government, which has better information-gathering capabilities in India than Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. All five members of the "Five Eyes" intelligence alliance—Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States—quietly affirmed Canada's position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Implications of India's Actions

### New Capacity for India

This incident marks a significant development, as the Indian government has not previously been observed assassinating individuals outside its borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This represents a fundamentally new capability for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

While state-sponsored assassinations are becoming more common among various nations (e.g., [[strategic_and_diplomatic_implications_for_russia | Russia]] and the United States) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, India's entry into this practice is notable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. With the Indian diaspora being arguably the largest globally, any attempt by the Indian government to use extraterritorial and extra-legal means to control it will be met with strong disapproval and could escalate if a target of greater governmental significance is affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Impact on Canada-India Relations

Canada is a major destination for Indian students and hosts India's fastest-growing ethnic group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This incident is likely to increase agitation within Canada rather than suppress discussion of these topics, particularly given Canada's free press and open information environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This publicity is also likely to extend to India itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### Impact on Western Relations with India

The Five Eyes' confirmation of Canada's statement raises questions about the future of relations between democratic nations like the US, UK, and Australia with India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

The US and Australia are part of the Quad grouping with India, a security dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. The UK also maintains ongoing economic and other relations with Commonwealth nations, including India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. The involvement of a major power like India in "unsavory" actions that contradict democratic norms will inevitably impact these relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### [[great_power_politics_involving_india_and_western_relations | Great Power Politics]] and Alliances

Despite the concerns, the issue for the US and Australia remains predominantly China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. In [[great_power_politics_involving_india_and_western_relations | great power politics]], standard diplomatic niceties often yield to hard security concerns when a significant threat is identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</sup>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This often means partnering with countries or personalities that would normally be undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

Historically, the US has allied with figures like Stalin against Hitler, and Mao against Stalin, demonstrating a willingness to overlook ideological differences for strategic objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Therefore, partnering with a "mostly democratic, a little bit unsavory" India to counter China, seen as the world's most totalitarian government, is considered an easy decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This approach implies that the relationships are alliances against a specific threat rather than deep friendships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

### [[Indias international relations and foreign policy | India's Strategic Autonomy]]

India faces decisions regarding its relationship with Western nations as actions against China intensify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Regardless of its alignment, India is expected to prioritize its own interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Historically, India maintained a non-aligned stance during the Cold War, often unofficially siding with the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. The current situation reflects a continuation of this strategic autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

Ultimately, the decision on its foreign policy lies with New Delhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Despite the controversy, as many countries align against China, India is projected to fare well globally, regardless of its relationship with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

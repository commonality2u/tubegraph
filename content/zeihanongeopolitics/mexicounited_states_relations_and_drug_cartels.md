The relationship between Mexico and the United States, particularly concerning drug cartels, presents significant challenges for American strategic leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

## Impact of Drug Cartels in Mexico
The "love of cocaine" in the United States has contributed to the destruction of the rule of law in large parts of Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. This, combined with what is described as the "general incompetence of the AMLO administration," has left Mexico in a "much worse position" regarding public safety, public health, and infrastructure compared to five years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.

## US Military Intervention Considerations
Despite the issues, a direct military solution imposed by the United States on the [[cartel_violence_and_structure_in_mexico | cartel situation]] is deemed impractical and "batshit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. Mexico is a vast country, and the [[cartel_violence_and_structure_in_mexico | cartel situation]] is considered far more complex than anything the U.S. encountered in Afghanistan or Pakistan during the War on Terror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

### Conditions for Military Involvement
Any potential military involvement would need to be "hand in glove with the Mexican Administration," similar to past cooperation with Colombia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. However, under the current administration in Mexico City, such a collaboration is "not even under a hair of consideration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.

### Risks of Unilateral Action
Should the U.S. attempt to impose a military solution without the active participation of Mexico:
*   The [[the_importance_of_nafta_and_usmexico_trade_relations | trade relationship]] between the two countries would be severely damaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.
*   This disruption could lead to an economic depression in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.
*   The Mexico-U.S. relationship is described as the "single most important economic, human migration, and Manufacturing and energy relationship in human history," meaning its breakdown would have severe consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.

China's economic model has historically relied on mobilizing its large workforce to produce and export processed, low-end manufactured goods to the global market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. This process involved importing raw materials, adding value, and then sending the finished products back out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. However, this model is no longer viable due to several significant challenges.

## Challenges to China's Export-Oriented Economy

The country is facing an [[Chinas economic decline and consumer spending|economic catastrophe]] largely due to a degrading trade situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

### Loss of Labor Advantage
The consistently decreasing birth rate means China no longer possesses a labor advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. Labor costs in Mexico, for instance, are now less than half of those in China, and Mexican labor is considered more than twice as qualified on average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

### Supply Chain and Shipping Vulnerabilities
China's economy is entirely dependent on the freedom of the seas to import raw materials and export its products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Potential problems with international shipping, possibly arising from events like the Ukraine war, pose a significant threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. This highlights [[Dependence of Chinas economy on international trade | China's dependence on international trade]] and [[Chinas import dependency on energy and materials | its import dependency on energy and materials]].

### Global Protectionism
The global landscape, especially the United States, has become sharply protectionist against China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.
*   Under the Biden Administration, tariffs on Chinese goods, including electric vehicles and Green Tech, have massively ramped up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
*   Further restrictions on Chinese exports are expected, with threats of tariffs as high as 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

### Declining Domestic Consumption
With a significant lack of people under the age of 40 in China, there is not much consumption left within the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. This exacerbates the economic challenges posed by declining exports.

## Interconnected Economic Problems

These issues are compounded by internal economic problems:

*   **Real Estate Bubble**: Approximately 70% of private savings in China are invested in residential real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. This market is collapsing, with official prices already dropping by about one-sixth in the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Estimates suggest most real estate may be worth only 10 cents on the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Bankrupt Local Governments**: Local governments, whose functions include providing essential services, are effectively bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. Their debt is estimated at about 90% of China's GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. They can no longer generate income by borrowing from state banks or selling land, as the demographic situation makes their population claims harder to falsify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
*   **Pyramid Scheme**: The real estate market was built as a pyramid scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. With a lack of young people providing seed capital, many recently started condos will never be finished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. Home sales in China have reportedly dropped by 70-80% over the last 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   **Apartments as Currency**: Bankrupt development companies are attempting to pay outstanding debts with finished or partially finished apartments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. Local governments have begun accepting these apartments as a form of secondary currency to pay off their own debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

This combination of factors suggests a [[Chinas potential collapse and its impact on global industry | collapse of the Chinese economy]] in the coming months and years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. The government's suppression of economic data makes it difficult to ascertain the full extent of the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.

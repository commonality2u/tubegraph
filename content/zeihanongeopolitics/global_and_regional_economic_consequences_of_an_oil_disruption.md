A severe oil crash due to conflict in the Middle East, previously considered unlikely, has become a significant concern due to recent changes in circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This scenario involves a conflict, dubbed "the next Gulf War," between Iran and Saudi Arabia, driven by desperation over energy exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Historically, the idea of Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz was discounted because Iran's own crude exports depend on it, making it an act of last resort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Potential Trigger: Israeli Retaliation

The current concern stems from Israel's stated intent to retaliate against Iran after a recent missile attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Israel has specifically shortlisted Iran's oil sector as a potential target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

A very obvious target is Kharg Island, which is the only meaningful export point for Iranian crude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The island is connected to the mainland via subsea infrastructure and hosts all of Iran's offshore loading platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Israeli capabilities, demonstrated by their ability to neutralize Iranian air defenses around nuclear programs in Isfahan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, suggest they could devastate Iran's entire oil export capacity with a few sorties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Iranian Retaliation and Broader Conflict

In a scenario where Israel devastates Iran's oil export capacity, Iran, feeling it has little to lose, would likely try to take out Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

The scenario outlined in a previous book involves:
*   **Military Invasion** An Iranian military invasion crossing into Iraq and Kuwait, heading south towards oil fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The southern half of Iraq, being Shia-populated, has a pro-Iranian slant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Missile Attacks** Iran possesses enough missiles to target oil export and processing facilities on the western side of the Persian Gulf, notably in Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Most of Saudi Arabia's crude comes from the Ghawar region, hard against the coast, and its loading platforms are on the Gulf Coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## Projected Oil Supply Impact

A conflict affecting Iran alone would mean a reduction of approximately 1 million barrels per day (bpd), which is manageable given Iran's long-standing sanctions and mismanagement of its system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. However, if major Gulf States, particularly Saudi Arabia, are brought into the conflict, the disruption could quickly escalate from 1 million bpd to 10 million bpd or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

Considering other countries in the potential conflict zone, such as Iraq, the UAE, and Kuwait, the total potential oil supply reduction could reach 20 million bpd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## [[impact_of_conflict_on_global_oil_prices | Global Oil Prices]] and Economic Consequences

Such a massive disruption would cause [[impact_of_conflict_on_global_oil_prices | oil prices]] to shoot above $300 per barrel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The current single [[impact_of_conflict_on_global_oil_prices | global oil price]] system would shatter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### United States
The U.S. presidency has the authority to summarily end all American crude oil exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Given the populism of current and aspiring presidents, an export ban would likely be implemented if [[impact_of_conflict_on_global_oil_prices | oil prices]] surge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This would create a super-saturated market within the United States due to the Shale Revolution's output, while denying the rest of the world several million barrels per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

*   **Domestic Market** This would lead to a functional ceiling of $60-$70 per barrel in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. The U.S. would "skate right on" while the rest of the world experiences a [[global_economic_restructuring_and_its_impacts | global depression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **California Exception** California would be in a different situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. It lacks pipelines connecting it to major U.S. oil fields (Ohio, North Dakota, Texas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a> and has not benefited from the Shale Revolution due to local regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. California imports most of its crude from the Persian Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. This could lead to $10 per gallon gasoline on the West Coast, creating a significant economic schism even within the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

### [[potential_consequences_for_chinas_economy_due_to_oil_supply_disruptions | China]]
[[potential_consequences_for_chinas_economy_due_to_oil_supply_disruptions | China]] would suffer the most by far, as it is the largest consumer of crude from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, and Iran. All of these sources would be jeopardized or eliminated in a conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### Saudi Arabia and UAE
Not all Persian Gulf producers would suffer equally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Both Saudi Arabia and the UAE have built bypass pipelines that avoid the Strait of Hormuz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. These pipelines could still export roughly 5 million bpd, possibly up to 6.5 million bpd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. If Saudi Arabia's exports are cut by half but [[impact_of_conflict_on_global_oil_prices | oil prices]] triple, it could be in a net financially superior position, assuming it avoids being conquered by Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## Probability

The likelihood of this scenario unfolding within the next few months is assessed to be between 1 in 4 and 1 in 3, depending on Israel's actions and Iran's reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Given the potential depth of this disruption, it is a significant concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

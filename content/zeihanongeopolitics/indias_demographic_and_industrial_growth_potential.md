India is identified as the "default winner" among the original BRIC countries, possessing significant long-term potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:19">[05:00:19]</a>.

## Demographic Transition
Similar to [[Brazil]], India has experienced a demographic shift and is now undergoing aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:08">[05:05:08]</a>. India's industrialization did not significantly begin until after 1990, largely due to its previous pro-Soviet stance, which led to a reluctance to participate in US-led globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:12">[05:10:12]</a>. Although India is aging quickly, this is not projected to become a major demographic challenge until at least 2070 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:20">[05:18:20]</a>.

## Industrial Development
Unlike [[Brazil]], India has never experienced a significant manufacturing surge, which means there is no pre-existing industrial base for other nations, like [[Chinas Demographic and Economic Challenges | China]], to exploit or "cannibalize" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:29">[05:27:29]</a>.

In a post-[[Chinas Demographic and Economic Challenges | China]] global environment, India will need to establish its own industrial infrastructure, representing a substantial growth opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:37">[05:37:37]</a>. This industrial development will be more complex compared to that in the United States, as the U.S. benefits from trade partnerships and specialized supply chains with countries like Mexico, Canada, Japan, Colombia, Korea, and Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:49">[05:48:49]</a>.

## Challenges and Advantages
India faces unique [[Challenges and Advantages Facing India | challenges]] due to its geopolitical environment; it is stated that every country bordering India has a hostile relationship with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:13">[06:14:13]</a>. This necessitates that India build its industrial and infrastructure systems independently, making the process more expensive and self-reliant than in countries with external partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:23">[06:21:23]</a>.

Despite these hurdles, this self-reliance means India's development will be an "Indian story," driven by its own motivations, timeline, and methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:37">[06:39:37]</a>. While this path may be prolonged, potentially less polished, and more challenging, it will result in India achieving global significance, even if it is not extensively involved in global supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:47">[06:47:47]</a>. This approach is deemed suitable in a de-globalizing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.

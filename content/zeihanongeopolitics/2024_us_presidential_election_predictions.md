The upcoming [[presidential_debate_analysis | presidential election]] is predicted to be a rematch of the previous one, featuring Joe Biden against [[potential_issues_with_donald_trumps_influence_in_future_elections | Donald Trump]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:06">[05:06:06]</a>. The ultimate victor is anticipated to be Joe Biden, primarily due to the voting patterns of independent voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:40">[09:40:40]</a>.

## Republican Nomination

The path to the Republican nomination for [[potential_issues_with_donald_trumps_influence_in_future_elections | Donald Trump]] is considered "hardwired in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:54">[02:23:54]</a>.
*   **Cult-like Following**: [[potential_issues_with_donald_trumps_influence_in_future_elections | Donald Trump]] commands a cult following similar to Bernie Sanders, with one-quarter to one-third of self-identified Republicans supporting him regardless of his actions or statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>.
*   **Delegate System**: The Republican Party's delegate system often operates on a "winner-take-all" mentality in most races, meaning the candidate with just one more vote than the second-place contender secures all delegates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:02">[01:34:02]</a>.
*   **Outsider Appeal**: This system allowed [[potential_issues_with_donald_trumps_influence_in_future_elections | Donald Trump]] to win the nomination previously, despite not being a traditional American conservative or Republican, by mobilizing a populist base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:49">[01:47:49]</a>.
*   **Split Vote**: With at least three other candidates already declared, the vote among other Republican contenders is sufficiently split, ensuring [[potential_issues_with_donald_trumps_influence_in_future_elections | Donald Trump]] will secure the nomination, even if someone like Florida Governor DeSantis enters the race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:54">[02:07:54]</a>.

## Democratic Nomination

The Democratic Party's nomination process differs from the Republicans.
*   **Delegate Distribution**: Democrats distribute delegates more proportionally, lacking the "winner-take-all" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:49">[02:31:49]</a>.
*   **Superdelegates**: A significant number of "superdelegates" (party institution representatives, primarily centrists) play a crucial role, especially at the convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:59">[02:44:59]</a>. These superdelegates intervened in the last presidential cycle to prevent Bernie Sanders from securing the nomination, ensuring Joe Biden's path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:41">[02:59:41]</a>.
*   **Party Strategy**: Centrists and center-left Democrats have decided they will not allow a repeat of the scenario where Bernie Sanders might gain momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:46">[03:32:46]</a>. They will act quickly to prevent him from getting the nomination if he runs again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:46">[03:37:46]</a>.
*   **Lack of Fresh Blood**: The Democratic Party has struggled in the last 25 years to introduce new candidates due to charismatic, politically, and economically powerful figures (like Biden, Pelosi, Schumer) who dominate the scene, creating a shallow bench <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:35">[03:47:35]</a>. This environment makes it hard for competitive primary candidates to emerge, leading to "freaks" like Bernie Sanders coming from the outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:20">[04:24:20]</a>.
*   **Biden's Path**: Given the centrists' determination to control the nomination, Joe Biden is considered a shoe-in for the Democratic nomination, barring a "complete meltdown" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:07">[04:39:07]</a>.

## General Election Factors

Several factors commonly discussed regarding elections are deemed less impactful in this predicted rematch:

*   **Age Issue**: Both Biden and [[potential_issues_with_donald_trumps_influence_in_future_elections | Donald Trump]] are old; if Biden wins, he'd be the oldest president ever, but if Trump wins, he'd also be the oldest president ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:03">[05:18:03]</a>. Therefore, age is not a significant differentiating factor for voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:10">[05:35:10]</a>. This ties into the broader topic of [[impact_of_age_and_vice_presidency_in_us_elections | Impact of Age and Vice Presidency in US Elections]].
*   **Vice Presidency**: Replacing Kamala Harris as Vice President would not change anyone's mind, as voters do not typically vote for the Vice President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:58">[05:47:58]</a>. This also relates to [[impact_of_age_and_vice_presidency_in_us_elections | Impact of Age and Vice Presidency in US Elections]].

## The Role of Independent Voters

The outcome of the election is largely dependent on the truly independent 10% of the American electorate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:02">[06:48:02]</a>.
*   **Voter Breakdown**:
    *   20-25% are hardcore Republicans or Democrats who will vote for their party's candidate regardless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>.
    *   Another 20% on each side identify as independent but consistently vote for either Republican or Democrat in 85% of races <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:07">[06:27:07]</a>.
    *   Only 10% are truly independent, characterized by being wishy-washy, judgmental, and prone to buyer's remorse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:02">[06:48:02]</a>.
*   **Midterm Behavior**: The 2022 midterms showed a deviation from normal patterns, where the party in power typically loses due to independent voters' buyer's remorse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:23">[07:00:23]</a>. In 2022, despite independents polling as disliking Joe Biden, particularly on economic issues, they decisively sided with Democrats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:04">[07:33:04]</a>. This points to the [[impact_of_donald_trump_on_midterm_electio ns | Impact of Donald Trump on midterm elections]].
*   **Preservation of Democracy**: The reason for this shift was the independent voters' perception that if the Republican Party under [[potential_issues_with_donald_trumps_influence_in_future_elections | Donald Trump]] alters the electoral system as they intend, swing voters and independent voters would become irrelevant and powerless in American democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:48">[08:10:48]</a>.
*   **Trump's Influence**: [[potential_issues_with_donald_trumps_influence_in_future_elections | Donald Trump]]'s emphasis on personal loyalty has led to "crap candidates" who are easy to vote against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:01">[09:06:01]</a>.
*   **Prediction**: Since independents, who usually don't even show up for midterms, voted against their own economic interests to oppose what [[potential_issues_with_donald_trumps_influence_in_future_elections | Donald Trump]] represents, they are expected to turn out in the general election and vote against him again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:21">[09:22:21]</a>. Therefore, Biden is predicted to win round two, as long as he does not die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:08">[09:43:08]</a>.

## Implications for Foreign Policy

A potential Biden victory raises the possibility of the first extended period of agreement in US foreign policy across administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:15">[10:04:15]</a>.
*   **Past Administrations**:
    *   Obama's administration had little foreign policy for seven of his eight years due to a lack of conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.
    *   [[potential_issues_with_donald_trumps_influence_in_future_elections | Donald Trump]] would tweet bold statements but lacked the ability to implement them due to an unwillingness to engage with government, bureaucracy, or Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:55">[10:21:55]</a>.
*   **Biden's Approach**: Joe Biden shares [[potential_issues_with_donald_trumps_influence_in_future_elections | Trump]]'s populist and nationalist approach to foreign economic policymaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:04">[10:47:04]</a>. However, unlike Obama, Biden believes in the power of government and can sit through meetings, allowing him to systematically convert [[potential_issues_with_donald_trumps_influence_in_future_elections | Donald Trump]]'s tweets into embedded foreign economic policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:23">[11:01:23]</a>. This suggests a notable [[comparison_of_trump_and_bidens_foreign_policies | comparison of Trump and Bidens Foreign Policies]].
*   **Contradictory Outcomes**: Biden supporters might be angry that he takes cues from [[potential_issues_with_donald_trumps_influence_in_future_elections | Trump]], while [[potential_issues_with_donald_trumps_influence_in_future_elections | Trump]] supporters might be angry that Biden receives credit for [[potential_issues_with_donald_trumps_influence_in_future_elections | Trump]]'s economic decisions and policy statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:35">[11:27:35]</a>.

The BRICS summit in South Africa, initially viewed as unlikely to yield significant results, aimed to discuss potential plans and consider new members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. Despite predictions of a "stupid Summit that's going to amount to nothing," it was considered worth discussing for insights into the international system's architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>.

## The Nature of BRICS

The BRICS grouping was never an organization founded by its members; rather, it originated from a finance individual's idea to invest capital from Baby Boomers into large bond markets in Brazil, Russia, India, and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. South Africa was later included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Historically, there has been no meaningful deal-making within BRICS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. While a Development Bank was formed, over 90% of its capital originates from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

Members like Brazil and South Africa primarily trade with China, but not significantly with other BRICS nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. India, which dislikes China, is a special case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

### Discussions on [[challenges_of_establishing_alternative_global_currencies | Global Currency]]

Despite occasional discussions about forming a [[challenges_of_establishing_alternative_global_currencies | global currency]] or an alternative to challenge the [[global_dominance_of_the_us_dollar | dollar]], these talks typically fall apart when details are considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. India, China, South Africa, and the BRICS-owned bank have explicitly stated they are not interested in a [[challenges_of_establishing_alternative_global_currencies | global currency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Only Russia, advocating for the ruble, and Brazil, with its "La Dee Da" foreign policy on economic issues, have shown interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

## BRICS Expansion and its Implications

The BRICS summit decided to expand, admitting six new members: Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt, Ethiopia, and Argentina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. This expansion suggests BRICS has no immediate plans for "anything useful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.

### Oil Production and the [[global_dominance_of_the_us_dollar | Dollar]]

Some argue that with the addition of Persian Gulf countries and Egypt, BRICS now accounts for 50-60% of global oil production, signaling the potential "downfall of the [[global_dominance_of_the_us_dollar | dollar]]" and the "end of the petrodollar" system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.

However, this is largely dismissed as "absolute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. While Saudi Arabia sells some oil in Yuan and Russia uses Yuan or Rupees to bypass sanctions, these are isolated instances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

The primary motivation for Saudi Arabia and the UAE to consider non-US dollar transactions is their search for security guarantees, fearing a US withdrawal from the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>. Their adherence to the [[global_dominance_of_the_us_dollar | dollar]] in the past was a bilateral relationship based on US security protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>. They are looking for alternatives because the US may no longer be interested in that role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. Current trilateral negotiations between the US, Saudis, and Israelis further underscore Saudi Arabia's security concerns, not a desire to abandon the [[global_dominance_of_the_us_dollar | dollar]] for financial reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>. China lacks the capacity to provide the necessary security deployment that the Saudis would accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>, especially given their primary foe, Iran, is now also a BRICS member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>.

### Internal Conflicts and New Members' Motivations

The inclusion of Iran, alongside Saudi Arabia and the UAE, was a necessity to allow expansion, but it guarantees diametrically opposed positions on significant issues within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. Consequently, BRICS cannot have a meaningful energy policy due to the opposing interests of Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.

The other new members bring limited value:
*   **Ethiopia:** One of the ten poorest countries, landlocked, and not part of China's One Belt One Road initiative because there's no investment case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. Added for "African flair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.
*   **Argentina:** Not poor, but has an "entitlement complex," hoping to receive Chinese money without repayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. Their motive is anti-debt repayment, not anti-[[global_dominance_of_the_us_dollar | US dollar]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>.
*   **Egypt:** Essentially a US satellite state, receiving US payments to maintain peace with Israel and Jordan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>. Its inclusion is seen as a "Trojan horse" potentially driven by India's lingering affinity for the non-aligned movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>.

### Historical Parallels and Future Prospects

The current BRICS expansion mirrors the Non-Aligned Movement during the Cold War, which sought a "new international economic order" to restructure Western trade practices to benefit former colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. This effort, which eventually led to preferential trade access for Africa, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) former colonies with European markets, never achieved its full desired restructuring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

The current BRICS group is even less likely to succeed because the interests of its members are far more diverse than those in the early post-colonial era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. Expanding membership is one of the most effective ways to ensure BRICS achieves nothing, as current members already disagree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

Generally, organizational expansion either leads to dominance by an overwhelmingly powerful member (like the US in NATO) or paralysis due to differing viewpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>. BRICS falls into the latter category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>.

For BRICS to significantly impact [[future_prospects_for_global_economic_systems | global economic systems]] and [[future_prospects_for_global_economic_systems | international currency]], either China would have to subsidize all members (unlikely, as it broke the Soviet Union's bank in the 1970s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>, or it would need to rapidly expand into a new Non-Aligned Movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>. However, China's and Russia's clear alignment goals and nationalistic, domineering objectives make it unlikely for middle and lesser powers to follow their lead and become "pawns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the BRICS summit and its expansion are seen as primarily rhetorical vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>, with Chinese President Xi Jinping even skipping some opening ceremonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>.

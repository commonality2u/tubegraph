The Ukrainian forces have successfully concluded the Kherson offensive, recapturing the city from Russian control. They are currently sweeping the area for remaining soldiers and inventorying captured equipment, which appears substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Context of Russian Withdrawal from Kherson

The Russian withdrawal from Kherson was primarily due to their inability to supply troops west of the Dnipro River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Since the Kerch Bridge went offline two months prior, all Russian supplies had to be transported by truck instead of rail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This truck-based supply method is approximately 1/1500th as efficient in a war zone compared to rail, making it unsustainable for the Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

The logistical problems experienced in Kherson are now applicable to the entire Southern front and the Crimean Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. It is suggested that a "smart play" for the Russians would be a wide-ranging, full retreat from all territory west of Mariupol and Kerch, including Zaporizhzhia Province, Kherson Province, and Crimea, to avoid a "catastrophic defeat" in the coming months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Logistical Denial and Partisan Attacks

Ukrainian [[ukrainian_military_strategy_and_offensive_preparations | military strategy]] focuses on logistical denial, which can collapse the Russian position even without a direct ground thrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

### Key Supply Interdictions

*   **Dnipro River Bridges:** The two bridges over the Dnipro River near Kherson and Nova Kakhovka are disabled, requiring months for proper repairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Kerch Strait Bridge:** This bridge is the sole rail connection between mainland Russia and the Southern front, including Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. A light rail line to the north has been interdicted by Ukrainians for months and is not used by Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Sea of Azov Route:** Truck traffic now goes around the Sea of Azov, a trip that is two to three times longer, 100 times more expensive in fuel, and transports significantly less cargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Crimean Entrances:** There are only three ways into Crimea: the Kerch Strait Bridge and two land connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
    *   One land connection on the eastern side has a bridge, which is expected to be targeted by Ukrainians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
    *   The western land connection is a narrow, five-mile-wide isthmus, now well within range of Ukrainian mid-range missiles following the fall of Kherson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Sevastopol Port:** Sevastopol is the only good port in Crimea, but it is effectively a "dead port" due to Ukrainian maritime drone and long-range missile attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Partisan Operations

The Russians have lost over two-thirds of their tactical military truck support fleet, often to Javelin missile attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. To compensate, they are using civilian vehicles like city buses and "Scooby-Doo vans" to transport troops, gear, and fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. These civilian vehicles are vulnerable even to small arms fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

A partisan campaign has been active in Mariupol since the second month of the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This area is now the primary supply line for Russian forces in Crimea and the Southern front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Russian reliance on vulnerable civilian vehicles through this area of strong partisan resistance makes them highly susceptible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### Impending Famine in Crimea

Crimea, with a population of about 3 million, cannot sustain a large-scale military operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. It has no oil or refineries, and sea shipments are interdicted by Ukrainian drones and missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. The Crimean Canal, which provides 80% of Crimea's food-producing water, sources from a sluice gate in Kherson Province near Nova Kakhovka, now under Ukrainian control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. This means the canal will likely not be turned on again in the spring, leading to a sprawling famine that could destroy any functional Russian military position in the peninsula or Southern front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

## Anticipated Ground Thrust

Despite the effectiveness of logistical denial, a ground thrust is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

*   **Launch Point:** The [[ukrainian_counteroffensive plans | Ukrainian ground assault]] will not launch from Kherson proper, as bridges are out and it would present the same logistical and defensive challenges the Russians faced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Instead, the assault will likely launch from Dnipro (Nepro), a city further upriver, which has multiple bridges across the confluence of the Dnipro and Samara Rivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Advantages of Dnipro:** This allows Ukrainian forces to deploy on multiple axes, at various points, and at different times without bottlenecking or being shelled by Russian forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Target Areas:** From Dnipro, Ukrainian forces can proceed south and attack anywhere within the box where Russian trucks are currently transporting supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
    *   **Melitopol:** Is a probable target due to its isolated position at the end of a "spike" from the Sea of Azov, making it easy to attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
    *   **Mariupol:** Is a "perfectly viable target" due to its symbolic importance after its prolonged resistance and its current role as the primary logistical supply point for many Russian trucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

> "wherever they punch South the point is they've got options now and they can go wherever the Tactical disposition of forces makes sense and everything to the west of that point is completely cut off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>

## Conclusion

The current situation presents Russia with a stark choice: either engage in a humiliating withdrawal from the Southern front and Crimea or face one of the most humiliating military defeats in their history by attempting to hold ground without adequate supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

Despite these significant challenges for Russia in the South, the war is not over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. The Russian occupation of Donetsk and Luhansk provinces does not suffer from the same logistical problems as they can be supplied directly from the Russian mainland by rail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Ukraine will have to remove them through traditional means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. This means the current phase marks "the beginning of the end of what is the easy part of the war for the Ukrainians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

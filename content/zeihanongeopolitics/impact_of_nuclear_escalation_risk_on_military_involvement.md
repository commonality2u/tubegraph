The [[strategic_nuclear_policy_discussions_involving_the_united_states | United States]] has adjusted its military strategy, particularly in light of the [[impact_of_the_russia_ukraine_conflict_on_naval_strategy | Ukraine war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. A significant factor influencing this approach is the potential for nuclear escalation.

## U.S. Approach to the Ukraine Conflict
Due to the "huge" [[russian_nuclear_threat_and_western_response | risk of a nuclear escalation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, the nature of the conflict in Ukraine prevents direct U.S. military involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Instead, the U.S. is "supplying the ukrainians to fight the war for us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

The military assets transferred to Ukraine primarily consist of equipment decommissioned in the 1990s and 2000s, dating back to the 1970s and 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The United States does not consider this equipment part of its current force balance sheet, viewing it as material "that we had to dispose of" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Consequently, the U.S. Army's primary equipment remains available for other operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The only major exception is some ammunition, but artillery shell production has increased fivefold since the war began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

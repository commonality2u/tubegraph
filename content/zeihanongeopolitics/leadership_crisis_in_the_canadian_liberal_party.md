The Canadian Liberal Party, currently in power, faces a significant leadership crisis that threatens the stability of its government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This situation stems from a long-standing leadership problem within the party, which has lacked intelligent and decisive figures capable of crafting policy for the past 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Background of Liberal Leadership

After a decade out of power in the 2000s under Stephen Harper's Conservative government, the Liberal leadership acknowledged their lack of charisma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Their solution was to appoint an "empty suit" with a "pretty face and great hair" as a figurehead, while a competent cabinet handled the actual governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This individual was Justin Trudeau, a "borderline failed kindergarten teacher" who benefited from his father, Pierre Trudeau's, legacy as a former prime minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Justin Trudeau is described as, at best, an "airhead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## [[Role and influence of Chrystia Freeland in Canadian government | Chrystia Freeland]]'s Influence and Departure

The true operational power in the Canadian government has been attributed to [[Role and influence of Chrystia Freeland in Canadian government | Chrystia Freeland]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. A former journalist, Freeland was on the Putin government's list long before it became common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. She went on to serve as Foreign Minister, Finance Minister, and Deputy Prime Minister of a G7 country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Freeland is considered one of the smartest people globally and arguably the most intelligent in Canada and its government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

She has been instrumental in redefining Canada's international standing in the modern era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Her appointment as Foreign Minister coincided with Donald Trump's first day in office, drastically changing the rulebook for Canada-U.S. relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. In a more nationalistic world, Canada's status for the U.S. elevated from country number 35 to number three due to its significant trading partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Any Canadian successes in macroeconomic policy, foreign affairs, and particularly U.S. relations, are largely credited to Freeland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

Recently, [[Role and influence of Chrystia Freeland in Canadian government | Chrystia Freeland]] had a disagreement with Justin Trudeau and resigned from the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. The immediate cause was the threat of tariffs from Donald Trump, with Trudeau reportedly wanting to spend money to offset the impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Freeland, understanding the unsustainability of this approach, wanted a better solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. When Trudeau wouldn't concede, she resigned as Finance Minister and declined a different job offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Her departure means the "brains behind the face" are now out of government, likely signaling the end of the Trudeau government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## [[Impact of internal politics on Canadas government stability | Canadian Political Instability]]

Canadian national politics are generally less stable than those in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

> [!info] Confederation Structure
> Canada operates as a confederation, where individual provinces often hold more power than the national government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This results in diverse economic and sometimes foreign policies across its 10 provinces, leading to a more fractured political system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

The electoral system in Canada encourages smaller and regional parties, unlike the two-party system often seen elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. This includes Fringe parties like the NDP and nationalistic regional parties such as the Bloc Québécois (which has advocated for secession) or the Wild Rose party in Alberta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This kaleidoscope of groups in Parliament makes forming and maintaining a government challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

The NDP, which was part of the recent governing coalition, left earlier this year but has not yet voted against the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. With the ruling Liberals now split between Justin Trudeau (the face) and [[Role and influence of Chrystia Freeland in Canadian government | Chrystia Freeland]] (the brains), the ball is in Freeland's court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. She has enough parliamentary support to oust the government with a simple vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. She also has the capacity to take over the Liberal Party leadership, potentially ending the 25-year period without an intelligent person at the helm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Whether she could win a new election is uncertain, as the current Conservative leader is relatively untested nationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## Dominant Political Issues

The most significant political issue in Canada today is a bipartisan concern: [[Canadas immigration strategy and demographics | immigration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Around 25 years ago, Canada faced an aging population problem, leading the Harper government to gradually open immigration doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. The Trudeau government continued this policy, recognizing that without significant immigration of people under 30, the country would face demographic collapse akin to China or Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

This [[Canadas immigration strategy and demographics | immigration strategy]] has been partially successful, alleviating labor shortages and bolstering the younger population, potentially buying Canada 20 to 40 years before a policy change is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. However, it has also created new [[challenges_posed_by_canadas_immigration_policies | problems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

> [!warning] [[Housing market and social tension in Canada | Immigration and Economic Strain]]
> Increasing the population by 10-15% in 15 years leads to a proportional increase in housing demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Immigrants, often arriving with some capital and skills due to the immigration system, can afford to buy houses, which drives up living prices for everyone, creating an inflation problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. This partial solution has generated an inflation problem, which is the dominant economic issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

The Trudeau government has attempted to address this by reducing immigration, for example, by scaling back university sponsorships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. However, this is expected to lead to labor shortages and further inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, highlighting the lack of easy solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. While relations with the United States are critical (the U.S. accounts for 80% of Canada's total trade) and potential tariffs are a significant threat, the issue of immigration and labor force challenges currently takes precedence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

From an international perspective, these are considered "great problems" because Canada, under the last two governments, has successfully "bought time" to grapple with these second-order effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. The main question remains who can offer convincing solutions to the electorate—be it [[Role and influence of Chrystia Freeland in Canadian government | Chrystia Freeland]], a conservative challenger, or someone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

Until approximately 2012, the [[United States foreign policy management under Trump | United States]] operated under a bipartisan consensus concerning foreign and strategic policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This consensus was founded on the belief that the Soviet Union was a threat and global communism was not a beneficial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. To ensure its security and economic well-being, the US aimed to build a worldwide alliance network and promote a globalized, free-trade environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This strategy incentivized most countries to participate in American security agreements for mutual benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This approach led to the formation of alliances like NATO, and partnerships with Japan, Korea, and Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. It also contributed to the economic growth of the non-aligned world, even if they weren't directly aligned with the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Erosion of the Consensus

The bipartisan consensus began to erode around 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This decline is attributed to several factors:
*   **Obama Administration** Eight years of "visceral disinterest in governing" during the Barack Obama administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Populist Presidencies** The subsequent presidencies of Donald Trump and Joe Biden, both described as highly economically populist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Republican Party Shifts** Over a 16-year period, the bipartisan consensus gradually disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The Republican Party, which historically authored many significant policies, has undergone a [[political_realignment_in_the_united_states | political realignment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. National Security conservatives and business conservatives are no longer central to the party's structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Furthermore, some factions within the Republican Party now find themselves "strangely aligned" on certain issues with nations like Russia, [[Impact of US policy shift on China | China]], Iran, and North Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

This period signifies a significant [[shifts_in_us_foreign_policy_and_its_implications | shift in US foreign policy]] and strategic policy, indicating that it is no longer a fixed entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Current State of US Foreign Policy

The [[United States foreign policy management under Trump | United States]] is currently in a state of international and internal political flux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Many traditional national security and economic principles are unlikely to persist because the political party institutions that created them are themselves unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The leadership of both the Democratic and Republican parties is steering their respective institutions into a non-functional period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. It is anticipated that these institutions will eventually reform, allowing for meaningful discussions on foreign policy again, but this is likely several years away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Challenges for Future Leadership

The lack of institutional loyalty and policy experience among potential presidential candidates makes it difficult to predict future policy priorities or reactions to hypothetical scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Foreign policy is largely a presidential prerogative, with Congress having limited influence in its formative stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Without a clear track record from future leaders, there is no reliable indicator of their foreign policy direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

## Policies Expected to Endure

The only policies likely to remain consistent are those where the president has ceded authority to Congress, locking them in via an Act of Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Overturning such policies would require another Act of Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. This list is short, primarily related to trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### NAFTA 2.0 (USMCA)
The most significant policy expected to endure is the renegotiated NAFTA, often referred to as NAFTA 2.0 or the USMCA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The renegotiation under [[United States foreign policy management under Trump | Donald Trump]] was considered a brilliant move, timely and with the right partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Mexico has become the primary trade partner of the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Mexico is seen as central to the US's future economic prospects, especially outside of a potentially dangerous and unequal relationship with [[Impact of US policy shift on China | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. The fact that the isolationist right wing of the US completed these negotiations makes it more likely to stick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Regardless of the next president, NAFTA 2.0 is expected to remain stable, as potential successors are unlikely to have the political authority or interest to overturn it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. This trade agreement is considered the single most important foreign policy priority for the United States in preparation for future global challenges, including [[Impact of global geopolitical issues on US foreign policy focus | Chinese belligerence and decline]], the [[Impact of global geopolitical issues on US foreign policy focus | Ukraine war's escalation]], Russian demographic issues, and the fracturing of the European Alliance due to depopulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

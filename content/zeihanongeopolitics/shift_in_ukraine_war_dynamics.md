The last 36 hours have seen the most significant shift in the balance of power in the Ukraine war of at least the last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This change primarily concerns the ability to use Western-provided weapons on Russian territory, specifically targeting logistical hubs supporting [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Russian military]] operations.

## Backstory: Kharkov and Belgorod

The conflict has centered around two key cities: Belgorod on the Russian side of the border, a large logistical hub and population center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, and Kharkov on the Ukrainian side, which is the second or third most populous city in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

Early in the war, forces originating from Belgorod launched a massive assault on Kharkov, nearly capturing the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Through clever maneuvering and a couple of [[ukrainian_counteroffensive in the war | counteroffensives]] about a year into the war, the Ukrainians were able to push the Russians back to the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

More recently, the Russians have made another attempt on Kharkov, using large numbers of technically outdated T-62 tanks to try and overwhelm Ukrainian defenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Despite the Russians facing horrific casualty ratios, sometimes between 5 and 6 to 1 against the Ukrainians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, they possess enough personnel to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

Throughout the war, [[US military strategy in the Ukraine war | Western nations]] have supplied Ukraine with weapons, but with the condition that these weapons could not be used on the Russian side of the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This restriction allowed Russia to launch continuous artillery and missile attacks from Belgorod targeting Kharkov City, including civilian infrastructure like the power grid and logistical hubs, causing significant hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Ukraine has been advocating for these restrictions to be lifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## The Pivotal Change

In the last 48 hours, these restrictions have been lifted, at least for the Kharkov axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. As a result, within 24 to 36 hours, Ukrainians began targeting military significant sites in the Belgorod area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Targets include artillery positions, air defense sites, ammo dumps, fuel depots, and rail yards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Immediate Tactical Implications

With the [[russian_strategies and developments in the Ukraine war | Russian logistical hub]] in Belgorod now being targeted and obliterated, the forces assaulting Kharkov will likely face severe supply issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This situation is expected to lead to a significant [[ukrainian_counteroffensive in the war | Ukrainian counteroffensive]] in the coming days to weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The goal is to liquidate this Russian group, turning them into fatalities by cutting off their ability to receive reinforcements, equipment, ammo, and fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, forcing them to retreat to the Russian border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Broader Strategic Considerations

Neutralizing Belgorod is crucial for Ukraine's long-term security as an independent state, given its historical role as a primary [[russian_strategies and developments in the Ukraine war | Russian military]] node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. While the current attacks may not be enough to fully neutralize it, it represents the best Ukraine can do without a ground invasion across the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

However, Belgorod is not the only logistical hub. Rostov-on-Don serves a similar role for the southern and southeastern fronts of Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. A key difference is that Rostov-on-Don is much further from the front line than Belgorod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, particularly the provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk, where Russia gained territory a decade ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. It is currently unclear if the Western weapons provided possess sufficient numbers and range to meaningfully target Rostov-on-Don <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. If Rostov could be removed from the equation, the Crimean Peninsula would almost instantly fall back to Ukrainian control, as it is the primary source of support, ammo, equipment, and fuel for Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## Western Policy Evolution

The initial hesitation from Western nations to allow their weapons to be used on Russian soil stemmed from concerns about Russian retaliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. However, the nature of Russian threats has changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Recent threats have primarily come from Dmitry Medvedev, described as Russia's equivalent of Tucker Carlson â€“ a mouthpiece used to test outlandish statements before more serious figures might utter them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

The fact that Medvedev has been the primary threatener led Western capitals to conclude that Russia was not serious about its retaliation threats given the current state of the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. With this "seal broken," it is expected that Western nations will further liberalize restrictions on Ukraine's use of Western military equipment to target [[russian_strategies and developments in the Ukraine war | Russian military]] assets whenever and wherever they are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. This is predicted to happen certainly before the end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, by which time some Western troops, notably French, are also expected to be operating within Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. This reflects a growing realization in Europe that for the war to conclude without European territorial concessions, it must be taken more seriously in terms of finance, equipment, policy, and deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

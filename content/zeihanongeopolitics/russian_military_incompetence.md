Predictions about the number of Russian soldiers deployed on the battlefield by June were impacted by issues stemming from [[russian_security_services_and_intelligence_failures | Russian security services and intelligence failures]] and widespread incompetence within the military leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. The best available information suggests that President Putin has been misled about the true state of his military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

## Incompetent Leadership and Corruption

Putin's inner circle is largely composed of sycophants, with only a few competent individuals, none of whom are in charge of the defense industry or military plans in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

### Sergey Shoigu
Sergey Shoigu, the current Defense Minister, is considered arguably the most incompetent person in the Russian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. He is responsible for the overall battle plan and the defense industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. It is believed that Shoigu has personally stolen one-third of the Russian defense budget allocated for equipment manufacturing over several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. An additional one-third of that remaining budget was reportedly stolen by his subordinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. This widespread corruption is a significant factor in the lack of sufficient equipment for the Russian military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

### Dmitry Prigozhin and the Wagner Group
Dmitry Prigozhin, who leads the [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Wagner Group]], is another defense official whose military incompetence rivals that of Shoigu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. Prigozhin was a caterer before building up the Wagner Group, a parallel military organization that operates as mercenaries globally and commits war crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Despite leading the military operation in Bakhmut, he lacks any experience in managing, leading, or participating in military operations himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

## [[russian_military_strategy_and_casualties | Military Strategy and Casualties]]

The incompetent leadership has led to severe [[russian_military_strategy_and_casualties | Russian Military Strategy and Casualties]]. For six months, Russian forces, including the Wagner Group, have relentlessly attacked Bakhmut, resulting in significant losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. Conservatively, at least 20,000 Russians have died and 100,000 have been injured in this single, not strategically significant, battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. These staggering losses in Bakhmut have severely impacted any [[russian_military_challenges_and_recruitment_issues | conscription or mobilization programs]] the Russian government has instituted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

### Manpower Shortfalls
The overall Russian military losses since the start of the operation are estimated at a minimum of 100,000 to 200,000 dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. In addition to the 100,000 injured in Bakhmut, another 100,000 have likely been injured elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

*   **Initial Invasion (February 2022):** Approximately 100,000 to 140,000 men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
*   **Partial Mobilization:** An additional 300,000 men were confirmed mobilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.
*   **Total Casualties (dead + injured):** Around 300,000 (100k injured throughout, 100k injured in Bakhmut, 100k+ dead) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

These casualty figures effectively negate the entire previous mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. While a second partial mobilization of perhaps 200,000 to 250,000 men may be ongoing, it means Russia's forces are not significantly larger than when they started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

### Quality of Recruits
The new recruits are significantly less skilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. Many have primarily been involved in building anti-tank fortifications, indicating a lack of combat experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. The quality of these fortifications is also questionable given the rapid mobilization of untrained personnel for such tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

This overall picture suggests that Ukrainian forces are likely to have a significant advantage in upcoming operations, despite the inherent uncertainties of war and the ongoing deception within the Russian government regarding the conflict's status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

Saudi Arabia and Israel have been engaged in extensive negotiations regarding a normalization program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Currently, most Arab countries do not recognize Israel as an independent state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Background

Some progress on this diplomatic front was made during the Trump Administration, with Morocco and the United Arab Emirates establishing ties with Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The current focus is on whether the Biden Administration can facilitate a similar agreement with Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This represents a significant potential shift in [[israels_potential_alliances_with_turkey_and_saudi_arabia | Israel's potential alliances with Turkey and Saudi Arabia]] and broader [[potential_alliances_and_partnerships_in_the_middle_east | potential alliances and partnerships in the Middle East]].

## Internal Saudi Debate

A central point of contention in these negotiations, particularly for the Saudis, revolves around the Palestinian issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. There is a generational debate within Saudi Arabia itself regarding whether to abandon support for the Palestinians and normalize relations with Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

*   The older generation, including the ailing King, reportedly wishes to continue backing the Palestinians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   In contrast, the younger generation, led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, appears to be less concerned with the Palestinian issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

The outcome of this internal power struggle in Riyadh will have substantial implications for the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Implications

A change in Saudi Arabia's political stance on regional affairs, backed by its significant influence as the world's largest oil producer and exporter, alongside its financial and military power, could rapidly lead to new developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. The direction of [[ussaudi_arabia_relations_and_future_outlook | US-Saudi Arabia relations and future outlook]] will be closely watched.

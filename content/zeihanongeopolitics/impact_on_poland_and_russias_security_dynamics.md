The permanent military deployment of approximately 5,000 German troops to Lithuania, as part of NATO commitments, marks a significant shift in European security dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This deployment is not a UN mission or a rotating program, but a permanent presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. For the past 75 years since World War II, the world has ensured Germany does not have a deployment-capable military, largely by embedding it within the NATO system and relying on the United States to underwrite German physical security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Germany has historically been a security consumer, with its borders broadly indefensible and surrounded by countries that, while allies now, have not always been so historically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The US has forcibly rewritten European security rules, keeping Europe united and at peace, predicated on Germany's agreement to avoid opinions on security matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

This agreement now appears to be ending, as Germany is developing its own military capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. While 5,000 troops in Lithuania may seem small, it signifies Germany's rehabilitation as a more normal country with military tactics and strategies as part of its toolkit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This will lead to Germany forming opinions on security issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. In the short term, this development is seen as beneficial for the European Alliance due to shared concerns regarding [[strategic_and_diplomatic_implications_for_russia | Russia]] and [[impact_of_the_russia_ukraine_conflict_on_naval_strategy | Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. However, Germany developing military capabilities again raises historical concerns, reminiscent of past periods where German disarmament ended, leading to significant conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Impact on Poland

Poland is identified as a significant loser from this transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Poland is currently undergoing a massive rearmament program designed to prevent it from falling to Germany or [[strategic_and_diplomatic_implications_for_russia | Russia]] again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This program was partly based on the assumption that Germany would not have an active military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Now, Poland will need to pay more attention to its western border, even though the German deployment in Lithuania requires close cooperation with the Polish government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Regardless of political affiliation, Poles are likely to be nervous due to their nation's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Impact on Russia

[[strategic_and_diplomatic_implications_for_russia | Russia]] is considered an even bigger loser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Both the Soviet and post-Soviet [[strategic_and_diplomatic_implications_for_russia | Russian]] systems benefited from the United States being in charge of regional security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This meant [[strategic_and_diplomatic_implications_for_russia | Russia]] never had to worry about countries like Sweden, Finland, Germany, or France acting independently, as long as a working relationship with Washington was maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

However, the [[impact_of_the_russia_ukraine_conflict_on_naval_strategy | Ukraine]] war, while bringing the alliance closer, has forced regional powers to take security matters into their own hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. While NATO members generally agree on countering [[strategic_and_diplomatic_implications_for_russia | Russia]], they are taking independent actions that are not necessarily coordinated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Germany, as Europe's largest economy, developing military capabilities is described as [[strategic_and_diplomatic_implications_for_russia | Russia]]'s "worst nightmare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This is because Germany has historically been the country that has given [[strategic_and_diplomatic_implications_for_russia | Russia]] the biggest challenge in the modern era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

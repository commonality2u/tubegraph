Historically, the [[canadas_relationship_with_the_united_states | relationship between Canada and the United States]] was paramount for Canada, particularly before the end of the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. The United States has consistently been Canada's primary trading partner by a significant margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Canada's traditional approach involved offering support during international crises, then seeking trade concessions for specific Canadian products like Saskatchewan wheat or Ontario auto parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. These accumulated exemptions were eventually codified into [[the_importance_of_nafta_and_usmexico_trade_relations | NAFTA]] as a form of appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Impact of the Trump Administration

With the commencement of Donald Trump's first term, the established norms of the [[canadas_relationship_with_the_united_states | US-Canada relationship]] were disrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Canada, previously considered a lower priority by the U.S. (around country number 35, behind nations like Russia, China, Japan, and Germany), suddenly became a top-tier focus, often ranking as the first, second, or third largest trading partner depending on how statistics are calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Chrystia Freeland's Role in US-Canada Relations

Chrystia Freeland, who became Canada's foreign minister approximately eight years ago—the same week Trump began his presidency—was instrumental in navigating this new environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. She was forced to adapt policies on the fly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Her efforts are largely credited for Canada's successes in macroeconomic policy, foreign affairs, and particularly in managing [[canadas_relationship_with_the_united_states | relations with the United States]], irrespective of the American president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Recent Challenges

A disagreement recently arose between Freeland and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, specifically concerning how to respond to Donald Trump's threats of tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Trudeau reportedly suggested spending money to offset potential tariffs, a strategy Freeland deemed unsustainable given Canada's economic realities, leading to her resignation as Finance Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Current Importance

Despite the historical and significant economic ties, [[canadas_relationship_with_the_united_states | relations with the United States]] are currently considered secondary to Canada's pressing internal issues, such as immigration and labor force challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. The threat of a 25% tariff on Canadian goods by its primary trading partner, which accounts for 80% of Canada's total trade, would be devastating for many commodities and manufacturing sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. However, even this significant threat is not the dominant issue in Canada's current political discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

Recent developments in the [[Ukraine war and military innovation | Ukraine war and military innovation]] have highlighted new capabilities in Ukrainian military technology, particularly with the deployment of a new drone missile system. These innovations suggest a [[Strategic changes in Ukrainian military tactics | change in the tempo of the War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## The Lenisa Drone Missile
The Ukrainians have introduced a new weapon system, technically termed a "drone missile" and named "Lenisa," which is described as being "a little bit shy of a cruise missile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

Key characteristics of the Lenisa include:
*   **Range** While its range of no more than 300 miles is less than some of [[Ukraines longerrange drone capabilities | Ukraine's longer-range drone capabilities]] that have hit targets up to 1,000 miles from the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Speed and Interception** As a missile, it flies much faster than typical drones, making it significantly [[Ukrainian tactics against Russian air defense systems | harder to intercept]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Payload Capacity** The Lenisa can carry a much heavier payload, with warheads estimated to be two to five times larger than the 75-pound warheads of Ukraine's previous larger drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Deployment** Despite its recent debut, these drone missiles are being deployed in large numbers, with at least 100 reportedly used in an attack on Toit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Impact on Russian Logistics
These new capabilities directly impact [[Russian military strategies and advancements in Ukraine | Russian military strategies and advancements in Ukraine]] and logistics, particularly their reliance on rail transport.

### Targeting Ammunition Depots
In late September, Ukrainians successfully targeted and "blew up a handful of major arm Depot[s]" within Russian territory, some hundreds of miles from the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. One such explosion was of kiloton range, detected by seismic monitoring stations a thousand miles away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

Russian ammunition storage practices, which involve hand-moved boxes rather than forklifts or pallets, contribute to the highly explosive nature of these depots when struck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Vulnerability of Rail Transport
Russia's primary method for moving cargo over long distances is by rail, with 90% of goods, including military assets, transported this way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This reliance creates a significant vulnerability. In the Tihoretsk attack, a train unloading ammunition was reportedly hit, leading to the destruction of the entire depot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

This suggests that the Ukrainians may have found a way to track Russian rail movements in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. The capture of the rail depot at Sudzha in Kursk Province weeks prior may have allowed Ukraine to tap into or hack the Russian rail network, providing schedules and locations of locomotives and their cargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

### Potential Shift in Targeting Strategy
With improved intelligence on the rail system and the availability of faster, more lethal, and mass-produced missile drones, the [[Ukrainian military strategy and offensive preparations | Ukrainian military strategy and offensive preparations]] is likely to shift towards targeting [[Russian strategies and developments in the Ukraine war | Russian strategies and developments in the Ukraine war]] in power generation and distribution systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Since two-thirds of Russia's locomotives are electric, disrupting the electricity system would cripple the entire Russian transport network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Early stages of this strategy may have been observed with drone attacks on power centers in Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

These attacks are expected to increase within 150 miles of Ukraine's northern, northeastern, and eastern borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. The impact is already being felt, with Russian counter-offensives in places like Kherson petering out and assaults on targets like Barvinkove in eastern Ukraine halting, likely due to these supply disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. This presents a significant challenge to Russia's military approach, which relies heavily on overwhelming numbers of personnel and shells, a strategy unsustainable without a robust rail network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

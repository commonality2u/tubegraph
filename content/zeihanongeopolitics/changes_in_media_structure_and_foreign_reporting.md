The ability of a population to be well-informed relies on having multiple, credible sources of information where there is agreement on basic facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This ideal state no longer exists in the United States, leading to a population that is increasingly uninformed and susceptible to propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. These [[challenges_facing_credible_news_consumption | challenges facing credible news consumption]] are exacerbated by [[impact_of_technology_on_media_credibility | technological shifts]] within the media landscape.

## Historical Evolution of US Media and Foreign Reporting

The decline in fact-based reporting and the restructuring of media began in the 1980s:

*   **1980s - The Fax Machine** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>: Previously, newspapers and TV stations maintained numerous roving reporters and foreign bureaus, ensuring multiple layers of fact-checking through copy editors and editors stationed abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The fax machine reduced the need for such extensive overseas staffing, leading to the gradual disappearance of roles like copy editors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **1990s - Email and Attachments** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>: This technology further streamlined communication, allowing for additional cuts in staff numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **2000s - Disappearing Foreign Bureaus** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>: Most foreign bureaus were closed, replaced by a few roving reporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **The Rise of the Internet and Cost Cutting** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>: The internet's ascent led to even more cost-cutting, eliminating most roving reporters in favor of local stringers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. While this provided local insights, it came without the necessary fact-checking, leading to reporting often "blinded by whatever the proclivities of the people who were collecting the information was" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Present Day - Algorithms and "Fake News"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>: Today, algorithms write newspaper stories and scrape the web for information, and fact-checking has largely vanished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This environment makes it easy for charismatic politicians to dismiss news as "fake news" and for political movements to form around individuals rather than facts or institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## The "Information Desert"

The current "information desert" in the U.S. is not unique globally:

*   **Middle East** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>: Regions like the Middle East, characterized by single-party rule, often experience an "information vacuum" where the rumor mill becomes the primary news source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This made efforts to establish basic truths challenging, as rumors spread via email and Twitter were often accepted as fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Russia** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>: In Russia, the rumor mill is augmented by a state monopoly on information, resulting in widespread state-sponsored propaganda on radio and TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

In the United States, media operates as a business driven by viewership, prioritizing what people *want* to hear over what is true or necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This has transformed prominent channels like Fox and MSNBC into largely opinion-based programs with minimal news content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Newsmax, for example, is entirely opinion-driven and would be at home in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Social media platforms also vary in news quality:
*   Twitter has become "colorful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   The Nightly News, favored by those over 50, is now two-thirds drug commercials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   Facebook, a common news source for those 25-45, is considered among the worst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   TikTok, used by those under 25, is at least better than Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Recommended News Sources

For international news, considering the [[comparison_of_global_media_sources | current media landscape]]:
*   **Al Jazeera** is suggested as the most reliable international source overall, though biased regarding the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. They are noted for interviewing multiple people with multiple viewpoints, a practice once known as journalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **France 24** is considered a strong second, one of the few entities still maintaining global bureaus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   **BBC** has significantly declined over the past 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Canadian Broadcasting** is viewed as "bottom of the barrel," being 100% opinion and party line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Local News Sources Globally** can provide biased but unique viewpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

For news within the United States, three national entities are suggested:
*   **The Wall Street Journal** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>: Primarily financial news, but strong in its focused area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **Bloomberg** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>: While not as good as it once was, it covers a wide range of topics with even-handed coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Straight Arrow News** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>: A new project aiming to provide non-partisan views from contributors across the political spectrum on finance to international affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

Recent events, such as the Iranian seizure of the Advantage Suite oil tanker, highlight a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy regarding international energy markets and maritime security, which has profound implications for [[potential_collapse_of_chinese_economy_and_governance | China's economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## U.S. Disengagement from Maritime Security
The United States has increasingly reduced its commitment to the global maritime order that facilitates international trade and energy markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This marks a departure from the post-World War II policy, where the U.S. would protect resource and product flows for its allies, allowing them to focus on economic development rather than military needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This shift has been consistent across the Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The U.S. no longer relies heavily on Middle Eastern oil, having become self-sufficient in North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

Consequently, when Iran seized the Advantage Suite tanker, the U.S. Navy's response was limited to a press release, indicating a lack of direct intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The U.S. "just doesn't care anymore" about managing international energy markets or responding to tanker seizures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## China's Vulnerability to Disrupted Oil Supplies
This U.S. disengagement poses a critical problem for China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The fundamental assumption underlying the [[potential_collapse_of_chinese_economy_and_governance | Chinese economy]] and its strategic position has been that the U.S. would uphold civilian freedom of the seas, regardless of China's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. However, the U.S. now has "no interest in that anymore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Economic and Geopolitical Consequences
Should a significant [[global_and_regional_economic_consequences_of_an_oil_disruption | interruption to international energy flows]] occur, the U.S. would likely "close its borders to energy trade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. In contrast, China is situated "at the very end of a very long supply line that they have no hope of protecting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

The consequences for China could include:
*   **De-industrialization** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>
*   The **end of [[potential_collapse_of_chinese_economy_and_governance | China's unified nation state]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>

This vulnerability to energy supply disruptions is considered one of "many reasons" why China's current trajectory may not be sustainable through the current decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

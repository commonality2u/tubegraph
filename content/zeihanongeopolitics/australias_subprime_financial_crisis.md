Australia faces a significant, homegrown financial challenge rooted in a subprime lending problem that has been left unaddressed for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49">[03:49]</a>.

## Nature of the Problem
Unlike the United States, which compelled banks and homeowners to absorb some losses during its subprime crisis to qualify for federal restitution funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58">[03:58]</a>, Australia responded by guaranteeing everyone's loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10">[04:10]</a>. This approach allowed the problem to deepen and fester for the past 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15">[04:15]</a>.

## Comparison to US Subprime Crisis
Conservatively, Australia's subprime problem is now estimated to be at least five times worse in relative terms than what the United States experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19">[04:19]</a>. If this situation were to crack, it could result in a crisis at least five times more severe than the US subprime crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38">[04:38]</a>.

## Potential Triggers and Impact
A sharp deglobalization shock or "de-Chinic" event could be sufficient to trigger a financial crisis in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31">[04:31]</a>. When combined with other economic challenges Australia faces, such as the adjustment from its [[Australias economic relationship with China | deep economic ties with China]] and the lack of [[Australias raw commodities industry and value addition | value-added processing in its raw materials industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45">[04:45]</a>, the country is likely to face a depression rather than merely a recession, potentially lasting half a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50">[04:50]</a>.

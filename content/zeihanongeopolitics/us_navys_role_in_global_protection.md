The United States has historically played a critical role in patrolling the global oceans, a system that is expected to change significantly in the near future, impacting the global economic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Historical Context and Establishment of Global Trade
Following World War II, the United States faced the challenge of containing the Soviets in Europe, which had been largely devastated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. To incentivize nations to align with the US and position themselves between American forces and the Soviets, the US offered a significant inducement: global trade and globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

This led to the [[historical_context_of_us_maritime_security_policy | US sending its Navy]] to patrol the global oceans, ensuring that any country could trade with another at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Furthermore, the American market, which was the only major market to survive the war intact, was opened to global exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. At this time, the US consumer market was approximately as large as the rest of the world combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

This arrangement created the foundation for the current global economic system, with a global GDP of roughly $90 to $100 trillion, a quarter to a third of which is based on international exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This system would not have been possible without the US patrolling the oceans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### US Naval Dominance
Even after three decades of other nations building up their navies, the [[naval_power_in_the_pacific_ocean | US Navy]] remains at least seven times more powerful than all other navies on the planet combined, especially when excluding close allies like the British and Japanese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

The United States did not establish this system for its own direct benefit, having a continental economic system with significant integration only with Mexico and Canada starting in 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The primary beneficiaries of this global trade setup have been Germany and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## [[shift_in_us_global_strategic_role | Shifting US Policy]] and Global Implications
For over a decade, the US has been incrementally moving away from maintaining this global system, leading to shifts in foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. The US is becoming less likely to protect assets such as oil tankers or shipments originating from Russian territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. As allies face demographic challenges, both the economic and security cases for globalization are weakening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Case Study: The Persian Gulf
The Persian Gulf is a crucial region for maritime shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. While the US primarily sources its energy from the Western Hemisphere, crude oil from the Persian Gulf has historically supplied the US alliance network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. More recently, especially since the [[impact_of_the_russia_ukraine_conflict_on_naval_strategy | Russia-Ukraine conflict]], much of this crude oil has been directed to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This shift has further weakened the strategic rationale for the US to maintain open sea lanes globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

As a result, the US Navy has notably done nothing in response to Iran confiscating or hijacking several oil tankers in recent months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. While the US is now deploying Marine Expeditionary Units (MEUs) to the region, an MEU, though significant with 2,000 Marines, has only about one-sixth the firepower of a Nimitz supercarrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. In the past, the US consistently maintained one or two supercarriers in the Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. The reduced US naval presence in the Persian Gulf signifies a departure from previous norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### Potential Future Disruptions from Russia
A likely scenario for system disruption involves Russia, which is conducting increasingly violent operations in Ukraine, including targeting the agricultural system to cause famine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. They are also using confiscated grain for shipments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. It is anticipated that the US may implicitly or explicitly remove protection for [[challenges_to_russian_global_maritime_operations | Russian maritime shipments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

Once an incident occurs involving these ships (e.g., piracy or state seizure), global insurance rates will dramatically change, as it will become evident that the US Navy is no longer providing global security for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### Impact on Global Supply Chains
This shift could lead to significant [[challenges_in_global_maritime_shipping | disruptions in global supply chains]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Many manufacturing processes, particularly for goods below the complexity of cell phones and computers, operate on margins of less than three percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. These processes often span numerous countries across the Asian rim and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Even a minor interruption in any of these low-margin steps can cause the entire product chain to collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

In the era of containerized shipping, where thousands of containers can carry hundreds of thousands of components for a single product, even small disruptions can break down the entire system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This could lead to the collapse of the entire economic model of East Asia in a single day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

For businesses with complex or "gangly" supply chains, it is advisable to make contingency plans, as there may not be sufficient time to build alternative systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

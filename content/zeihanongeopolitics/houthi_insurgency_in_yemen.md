Yemen has been experiencing an insurgency for an extended period, involving multiple factions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The primary groups include a relatively secular government, a Sunni militia unofficially linked with Al-Qaeda, and a Shiite group known as the Houthis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The Houthis are described as largely incompetent and struggling with cohesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Yemen's Economic and Geopolitical Context
Yemen possesses little of significant value to fight over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. While there is some natural gas, most businesses exited the sector about 15-20 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The country faces severe water table crashes, with most agricultural production dedicated to Qat, a mild narcotic, rather than food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The complex and tedious nature of the conflict often leads to its avoidance by external observers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Houthi Actions Against International Shipping
Since the onset of the [[Hamas attacks on Israel | Gaza War]], the Houthis have escalated their activities, launching missiles and drones at [[impact_of_yemen_conflict_on_international_shipping | international shipping]] in the Red Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Their strategic position on the eastern side of the Bab el-Mandeb strait, at the southwestern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, grants them the ability to reach vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Despite claiming to target vessels affiliated with Israel, their lack of identification capabilities means they often fire indiscriminately at any passing ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## [[Irans support for Houthi forces | Iranian Support and Regional Rivalry]]
The Houthis are incapable of manufacturing their own weapons, relying entirely on [[irans_support_for_houthi_forces | Iran]] for their arms supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. [[Irans support for Houthi forces | Iran]] actively backs the Houthis in this multi-sided conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. [[Iran Saudi Arabia rivalry | Iran]] leverages the Houthis to launch missiles and drones into Saudi Arabia, their primary regional rival, from across the Saudi border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

Saudi Arabia has generally avoided direct military confrontation, instead using the conflict in Yemen as target practice for their fighter pilots, anticipating a future potential conflict with Iran over Saudi oil fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. In 2022, the Saudis and Houthis agreed to a ceasefire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Since then, the Houthis, with [[irans_support_for_houthi_forces | Iranian support]], have been stockpiling weapons in preparation for future hostilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## [[US Air Assault on Houthi Targets | US Air Assault]]
On January 12th, the United States launched a moderate-sized [[us_air_assault_on_houthi_targets | air assault]] on Houthi targets in Yemen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. The strikes utilized Tomahawk missiles and fighter bombers, targeting Houthi command and control systems, radar, and, primarily, their ammo dumps and launch facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The Houthi-controlled territory is significant in size, making a full-scale invasion akin to the Iraq War not an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

These Houthi actions have disrupted approximately 12% of global trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The precipitating event for the US strikes was the launch of a ballistic anti-ship missile at a US Naval asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. The US response was a direct consequence of targeting its naval vessels, rather than solely concerns over commercial shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. The message conveyed to [[irans_support_for_houthi_forces | Iran]] is that further targeting of US assets will result in a significantly more involved response, extending beyond just the Houthis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

## Iranian Motivations and Outlook
[[irans_support_for_houthi_forces | Iran]] relies heavily on the Strait of Hormuz for its oil exports, which gives the US leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. A similar incident occurred in 2016 when the Houthis targeted an American naval asset, leading to significant Houthi losses and a cessation of such threats until recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

[[irans_support_for_houthi_forces | Iran]] maintains a stronger support relationship with the Houthis due to their shared Shia identity, unlike Hamas, which is Sunni <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. While Iran is content with the ongoing [[Hamas attacks on Israel | Israel-Hamas conflict]], it views Hamas as disposable and is unlikely to intervene significantly to protect it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. In contrast, [[iran_saudi_arabia_rivalry | needling Saudi Arabia]] through the Houthis is a more strategically important goal for Iran than agitating Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Iran's primary long-term strategic focus is on its rivalry with Saudi Arabia, making them eager to keep the Houthis engaged on that front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. It is suggested that [[geopolitical_tensions_in_the_middle_east | Iran]] does not want to bleed resources in a conflict with the US or Israel, preferring to reserve its assets for a potential future [[potential_gulf_war_involving_iran_and_saudi_arabia | confrontation with Saudi Arabia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. The speaker predicts a potential de-escalation of tensions in Yemen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

The "Five Eyes" is an intelligence-sharing alliance comprising five Anglo-Saxon countries: Canada, [[Australia's strategic alliance with the United States | Australia]], New Zealand, the [[security_concerns_of_the_united_kingdom | United Kingdom]], and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. These nations share intelligence on a wide range of subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

## The India-Canada Assassination Plot and Five Eyes Intelligence

The Five Eyes alliance played a crucial role in verifying accusations made by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau regarding an assassination plot on Canadian soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. Trudeau stated that the Indian government had assassinated a Sikh immigrant, who held Canadian citizenship, in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

### Intelligence Flow and Verification
The intelligence suggesting the Indian government's involvement did not originate from Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. Instead, it came from the United States, which possesses superior intelligence capabilities in Canada compared to the Canadian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. The intelligence was then verified by the [[security_concerns_of_the_united_kingdom | British]] government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. The [[possible_strategic_alliances_for_the_uk | UK]] has much better information-gathering capabilities in India than Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

Ultimately, all Five Eyes members quietly affirmed that Canada's accusation was accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. This incident marks a significant development, as the Indian government has not previously been observed assassinating individuals outside its immediate borders, indicating a new operational capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

### Implications for International Relations
The Five Eyes' confirmation of the Canadian statement raises questions about future relations between the [[security_concerns_of_the_united_kingdom | UK]], [[Australia's strategic alliance with the United States | Australia]], the United States, and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. Both the U.S. and [[Australia's strategic alliance with the United States | Australia]] are part of the Quad grouping with India, a platform for security discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. The [[possible_strategic_alliances_for_the_uk | UK]] also maintains ongoing economic and political relations with India through the Commonwealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

The act of a major power like India engaging in "unsavory" activities that violate democratic norms is expected to impact these relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. However, the U.S. and [[Australia's strategic alliance with the United States | Australia]] prioritize countering China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. In "great power politics," conventional diplomatic norms can be set aside in favor of urgent security concerns, leading to alliances with diverse partners against a common threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

This pragmatic approach means that while the relationship with India may evolve, the partnership to counter China is likely to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. India's future decisions regarding its alignment with Western nations will be critical as actions against China intensify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>.

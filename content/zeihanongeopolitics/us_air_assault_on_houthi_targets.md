Yemen has been embroiled in an [[houthi_insurgency_in_yemen | insurgency]] for decades, involving a relatively secular government, a Sunni militia unofficially linked with Al-Qaeda, and the Shiite Houthis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The region has little worth fighting over, with limited natural gas and agricultural production largely dedicated to Qat, a mild narcotic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.

## Houthi Aggression in the Red Sea

Since the [[hamas_attacks_on_israel | Gaza War]] began, the Houthis have escalated by launching missiles and drones at [[impact_of_yemen_conflict_on_international_shipping | international shipping]] in the Red Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. Their position on the eastern side of the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, at the southwestern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, allows them to reach this vital shipping lane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

The Houthis are incapable of manufacturing their own weapons; all armaments are supplied by [[irans_support_for_houthi_forces | Iran]], which specifically backs the Houthis in the multi-sided conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. [[irans_support_for_houthi_forces | Iran]] uses Houthi cover to launch missiles and drones into Saudi targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

In 2022, the Saudis and Houthis agreed to a ceasefire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Following this, the Houthis, with Iranian support, began stockpiling weapons in anticipation of future hostilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. In the aftermath of the October 7th assault on Israeli targets by [[hamas_attacks_on_israel | Hamas]], the Houthis claimed to be attacking shipping affiliated with Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. However, due to their inability to properly identify targets, they indiscriminately fire at anything passing by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. This aggression has disrupted 12% of global trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

## US Air Assault on January 12th

On January 12th, local time, in the middle of the night, the United States launched a moderate-sized air assault against Houthi targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. The strikes utilized Tomahawk missiles and fighter bombers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. Targeted sites included command and control systems, radar installations, and primarily ammunition dumps and processing facilities from which Houthi launches originate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

The immediate trigger for the US response was a ballistic anti-ship missile launched at a US Naval asset earlier on January 12th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. The US priority is not primarily commercial shipping, but rather a direct response to attacks on its naval vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. The message conveyed to the Iranians is that targeting US assets will result in a significantly more involved response, extending beyond just the Houthis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

## Iran's Strategic Priorities

[[irans_support_for_houthi_forces | Iran]] maintains a stronger support relationship with the Houthis than with [[hamas_attacks_on_israel | Hamas]], largely due to shared Shia identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. While Iran views [[hamas_attacks_on_israel | Hamas]] as disposable, the Houthis are seen as an asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>. Iran's primary regional foe is Saudi Arabia, and needling Saudi Arabia through Houthi proxies is a more [[strategic_vulnerabilities_and_targets_in_the_middle_east | strategically important]] objective than merely provoking Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.

Iran's long-term goal is to keep the Houthis focused on Saudi Arabia, as this is where Iran anticipates its future conflict will lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>. Iran desires the United States to remain out of this specific regional rivalry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>. While needling the US and Israel offers good public relations across the Middle East, Iran is likely not interested in "bleeding" for these secondary objectives, as its main fight requires all available assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>.

A similar situation occurred in 2016, when Houthis targeted an American naval asset, leading to their equipment being destroyed within days, with no subsequent threats against US naval assets until recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. This historical precedent suggests a potential for de-escalation, contingent on Iran's willingness to engage in dialogue with the Biden Administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. It is anticipated that the situation in Yemen will simmer down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.

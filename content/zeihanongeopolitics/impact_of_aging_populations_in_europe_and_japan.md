Many developed economies, particularly in Europe and Japan, are experiencing significant economic slowdowns, with some already in recession. This global trend, excluding North America, is largely attributed to [[demographic_shifts_and_economic_implications | demographic shifts]] and aging populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Current Economic Status

Several major economies in Europe and Japan are currently facing economic contractions:
*   The United Kingdom is in recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.
*   Japan is in recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   Germany is in recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   Other European nations like Israel, the Netherlands, most of Scandinavia, and Western Europe are experiencing slow economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   Italy hit this demographic stage earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   Germany is currently going through this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   South Korea is also approaching this trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   Spain is not in a good economic state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   The Netherlands' economic outlook does not appear positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Demographic Drivers of Economic Decline

The primary cause for the economic struggles in Europe and Japan is [[demographic_and_economic_challenges_in_europe | aging populations]], which are further along in this trend than other parts of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. On average, half of the world's Baby Boomer generation has already retired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Impact on Consumption
The [[impact_of_demographics_on_economic_future | impact of demographics on economic future]] is significant, particularly concerning consumption. As individuals age past their mid-40s, their consumption tends to decrease relative to their income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Upon retirement, this consumption dramatically plummets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. A large portion of the advanced world has now reached this point where a significant share of their population is reducing consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Limited Growth Avenues
For these economies, growth driven by consumption is no longer a viable possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Furthermore, their export-led growth to markets like China is becoming limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. If the American market also becomes less accessible, these economies are left with no significant drivers for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### A Period of Global Economic Stagnation?
It is possible that the world has already passed through its last major period of [[global_demographic_shifts_and_future_economic_implications | economic growth on a global basis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. If Europe, Northeast Asia, and China are all experiencing demographic-driven slowdowns, the only remaining region showing significant economic growth is North America, led by the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

> [00:02:49] "because if the Europeans are done and a lot of the Northeast Asians are done and the Chinese are done all that is left is North America where the United States is leading some record growth for a mix of reasons"

This bifurcated world sees North America becoming increasingly economically promising due to domestic growth, while other regions struggle with diminished consumption-led and export-led growth capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This situation is expected to persist until some economies might "fall off the map," potentially leading to industrial growth and consumption growth in one place, or depression and inflation simultaneously if supply chains break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

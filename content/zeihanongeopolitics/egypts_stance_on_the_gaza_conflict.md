Egypt is identified as the only country capable of significantly altering the trajectory of the [[israel_and_hamas_conflict_overview | Israel and Hamas conflict]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. However, its position is firmly against involvement or aid.

## Rejection of Refugee Relocation

The [[israels_defense_and_political_response | Israelis]] had hoped to convince the United States and United Nations that a solution to the conflict involved relocating all Gazans out of the Gaza Strip and into either existing camps or temporary camps in the Sinai region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This concept of moving Palestinians has been an ongoing effort by [[israels_defense_and_political_response | Israelis]] since at least 1973, or even 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

Egypt was the most "vociferous" in its objection to this proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Opposition to Aid and Entry

Beyond refusing refugee relocation, Egypt is broadly against sending aid into Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Historically, Egypt controlled Gaza between 1948 and 1973, a period described as difficult for all involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

Egypt's preferred scenario for Palestinians crossing into Egyptian territory is "in coffins or preferably... trucks full of bodies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Therefore, no assistance is expected from Egypt in the current conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This contributes to the observation that the conflict is primarily between [[hamas_attacks_on_israel | Hamas]] and [[israels_defense_and_political_response | Israel]], with limited regional intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

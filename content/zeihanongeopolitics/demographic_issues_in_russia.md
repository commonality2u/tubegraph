Russia faces significant [[Demographic challenges facing Russia | demographic challenges]] that are impacting its military capabilities and internal stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Decline of Russian Ethnicity
The [[russias_demographic_challenges | demographic decline]] among the Russian ethnicity is so substantial that within a few years, Russia may struggle to control its own populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. There is a possibility that Russia, meaning its population, could be "broken" within the next 10 or 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Manpower Strategy and Challenges
Historically, Russia's expansion involved conquering minorities, [[ethnic_tensions_within_the_russian_federation | Russifying]] them, and using them as "cannon fodder" for further conquests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. However, this strategy is now failing due to [[russias_demographic_challenges | demographic decline]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

In the ongoing conflict, the Russian strategy relies on mass artillery assaults followed by large numbers of barely trained conscripts to pin down Ukrainian defenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. While this slow, grinding process has been effective due to Russian manpower superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, their ability to maintain this is diminishing.

Over the last two and a half years, Russia has focused logistical efforts on building a pipeline of men and material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This involves forcibly drafting men from the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. To avoid a political crisis, they've prioritized drafting from [[ethnic_tensions_within_the_russian_federation | occupied minority populations]], viewing young men from these areas as "disposable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. However, this source is drying up, and the "cupboard is getting dry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

The pipeline of forces is running low not only in terms of overall manpower but also in leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. For instance, in the Kursk operation, a former bodyguard was assigned to command, indicating a lack of competent military leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Russia typically requires a 3:1 to 7:1 manpower superiority for attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, but they currently lack the forces needed for effective counter-offensives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

Russia has been unable to find the 30,000 to 70,000 troops required to retake Kursk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. In response to the Ukrainian incursion, Russia has mobilized nearly all remaining military forces, including denuding security personnel from Pacific, Baltic, and Arctic theaters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Even security forces from their Far East cosmodrome have been redeployed, often untrained for combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

The conclusion of the Kherson offensive in November 2022 highlighted critical [[consequences_for_russian_logistics_and_transport | Russian logistics and transport]] challenges, particularly concerning the Crimean peninsula and the Southern front of the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The inability to adequately supply troops west of the Dnipro River led to the Russian withdrawal from Kherson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This logistical vulnerability is now predicted to extend to the entire Southern front and Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Impact of Bridge Damage

The primary catalyst for these issues was the damage to the Kerch Bridge several months prior to the Kherson withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This bridge is the only direct rail connection between mainland Russia and the Southern front, including Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Without this vital rail link, Russia was forced to rely on truck transport, which is significantly less efficient in a war zone (approximately 1/500th as efficient) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

Similarly, the two bridges across the Dnipro River at Kherson and Nova Kakhovka have been disabled, requiring months for proper repairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. While Ukrainian forces could theoretically use pontoons, this would expose them to the same logistical problems the Russians faced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Vulnerable Supply Routes

With the fall of Kherson, all three primary ways into Crimea are now vulnerable to Ukrainian interdiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>:

1.  **Kerch Strait Bridge:** The only rail connection is damaged and was the initial source of major logistical issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
2.  **Land Isthmuses:**
    *   **Eastern Isthmus:** Features a bridge that Ukrainian forces are expected to target soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
    *   **Western Isthmus:** A narrow, approximately five-mile-wide strip of land, is now well within range of Ukrainian medium-range missiles due to their presence on the Dnipro River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
3.  **Sea Shipments:** The only viable port, Sevastopol, is effectively a "dead port" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Ukrainian maritime drones and long-range missiles have interdicted shipping lanes, causing both military and civilian vessels to cease operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Russia has also "basically evacuated completely from the Western half of the Black Sea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

Currently, much of the truck traffic that would have used rail is now forced to take a long, inefficient route around the Sea of Azov, doubling or tripling the distance and increasing fuel costs by a factor of 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Partisan Attacks and Trucking Vulnerability

Beyond direct logistical denial, [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | partisan attacks]] pose a significant threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Early in the war, Javelin missiles primarily targeted Russian trucks, destroying over two-thirds of their tactical military truck support fleet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This has forced the Russian military to use civilian vehicles like city buses and Scooby-Doo vans to transport troops, gear, and fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. These civilian vehicles are easily disabled by small arms fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

A partisan campaign has been active around Mariupol since the second month of the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. With Mariupol now serving as the primary supply line into Crimea and the Southern front, the most vulnerable Russian vehicles are traveling through an area with the war's largest partisan resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## Predicted Outcomes

These combined logistical challenges are expected to cause a collapse of the [[russian_defensive_positions_and_supply_challenges | Russian defensive positions and supply challenges]] even without a major ground thrust, as all food and supplies into the Southern front and Crimea would be cut off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### Strategic Withdrawal or Catastrophic Defeat

Russia faces a dilemma: either engage in a humiliating withdrawal from all territory west of Mariupol and Kerch, including the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson Provinces and Crimea, or suffer a catastrophic defeat in the coming months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### Famine in Crimea

The [[impact_on_russian_military_operations_in_crimea | impact on Russian military operations in Crimea]] extends beyond military supply to the civilian population. Crimea cannot sustain a large-scale military operation or its population of approximately 3 million without external support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

Key factors contributing to a potential famine:
*   **Lack of Resources:** Crimea has no oil or refineries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Cut-off Water Supply:** The Crimean Canal, which supplies water for 80% of Crimea's food production, sources its water from a sluice gate in Kherson Province near Nova Kakhovka, an area now controlled by the Ukrainian army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. The canal is unlikely to be reactivated, leading to a significant loss of local food production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **No External Supply:** With the Kerch Bridge offline and [[challenges_of_russian_naval_power | challenges to Russian global maritime operations]] severely limiting sea shipments, food cannot be brought in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

These combined factors point to a potential "sprawling 1980s style Ethiopia style famine" that would "utterly destroy any hope the Russians have of having any sort of functional military position anywhere in the peninsula or the southern front" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Remaining War Challenges

Despite these severe [[strategic_challenges_for_russian_military_withdrawal | strategic challenges for Russian military withdrawal]] from the Southern front, the war is not over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. The Russian occupation of Donetsk and Luhansk provinces does not suffer from these logistical problems, as they can be supplied directly from the Russian mainland by rail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Ukraine will have to remove these forces "the old-fashioned way," indicating the end of the "easy part of the war" for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

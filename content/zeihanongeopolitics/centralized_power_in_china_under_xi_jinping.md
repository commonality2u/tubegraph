Since [[impact_of_xi_jinpings_leadership_on_chinas_governance | Xi Jinping]] assumed leadership, there has been a significant drive towards centralizing power within [[chinas_political_structure_and_centralization | China's political structure]]. This effort extends across various sectors, including the military, aiming to consolidate all decision-making through Beijing and ultimately through [[impact_of_xi_jinpings_leadership_on_chinas_governance | Xi]] personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

## Military Command Structure

In the United States, the Defense Secretary formally commands forces and reports directly to the President as a cabinet member, with orders flowing from the President to the Secretary of Defense to the troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

China's military command structure operates differently:
*   The Defense Ministry does not have operational control over the military or policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.
*   Its role is largely that of a "glorified press secretary" handling military diplomacy and serving as an interface for foreign engagement, but they are not the decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
*   Real decision-making power resides with the Central Military Commission (CMC), which is chaired by [[impact_of_xi_jinpings_leadership_on_chinas_governance | Xi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.
*   A new Defense Minister, Dong Jun, an admiral, was recently appointed after the previous minister vanished for two months before being formally disposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. However, the Defense Minister position in China is not a powerful one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

## [[impact_of_xi_jinpings_leadership_on_chinas_governance | Xi Jinping's]] Purges and Centralization
[[military_purges_in_china | Purges]] have been a consistent feature of [[impact_of_xi_jinpings_leadership_on_chinas_governance | Xi's]] leadership, ongoing for approximately 14 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. These purges are aimed at [[xi_jinpings_influence_on_the_chinese_military | Xi]] tightening his grip on all aspects of governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

When [[impact_of_xi_jinpings_leadership_on_chinas_governance | Xi]] came to power, China was characterized by significant corruption and a degree of decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. The [[chinas_political_structure_and_centralization | Chinese Communist Party]] seeks to centralize all decision-making through Beijing and personally through [[impact_of_xi_jinpings_leadership_on_chinas_governance | Xi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. Given China's population of 1.3 billion, this requires extensive regional and local government involvement, where decisions were previously made independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

### Initial Purges
[[impact_of_xi_jinpings_leadership_on_chinas_governance | Xi]] established a series of purges to target both corruption and perceived political competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Over 12 years, this process systematically removed individuals who might oppose him, effectively "gutting the system" of anyone with ambition or competence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. This has impacted local government, state government, academia, business, and the federal bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

### [[military_purges_in_china | Military Purges]]
The military was initially excluded from these purges due to its powerful nature and the presence of armed personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. However, [[impact_of_xi_jinpings_leadership_on_chinas_governance | Xi]] has now begun to extend the purges to the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.
*   In recent months, [[impact_of_xi_jinpings_leadership_on_chinas_governance | Xi]] has fired 20 top-level individuals, including 12 in just the last two weeks, to impose his stamp on the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.
*   These [[military_purges_in_china | purges]] target political players or those guilty of corruption, even including a recently appointed defense minister chosen by [[impact_of_xi_jinpings_leadership_on_chinas_governance | Xi]] himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

### Impact on Bureaucracy and Military
The Central Military Commission (CMC), responsible for military planning, is now reportedly stacked with "incompetent yes-men" or individuals who avoid saying anything at all to avoid bothering [[impact_of_xi_jinpings_leadership_on_chinas_governance | Xi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. This represents [[xi_jinpings_influence_on_the_chinese_military | Xi]] imposing the same "structural gutting" on the military that has been seen elsewhere in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

As a result, China's bureaucracy has become dysfunctional, with individuals unwilling to transmit information due to uncertainty about [[impact_of_xi_jinpings_leadership_on_chinas_governance | Xi's]] response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. This paralysis is now observed in military activities as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.

## Consequences for Military Preparedness
Historically, China's military preparedness and capability were constrained by a lack of expertise and massive corruption, similar to Russian-style theft of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. If [[impact_of_xi_jinpings_leadership_on_chinas_governance | Xi]] fully implements his vision, a significant portion of the military's waking hours will be spent reading texts by [[impact_of_xi_jinpings_leadership_on_chinas_governance | Xi Jinping]] about himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. The ultimate impact of these changes on the military's effectiveness remains to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

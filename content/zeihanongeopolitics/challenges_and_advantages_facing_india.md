Many people question whether India will be the next [[comparison_of_india_and_china | China]], given its large population, current demographic advantages, and rapid growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. However, a resounding "no" is the answer, which Indians should be pleased with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The success of [[comparison_of_india_and_china | China]] was based on factors that India does not share and which are now proving problematic for [[comparison_of_india_and_china | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Comparison with China's Model

### Reliance on U.S. Strategic Largesse and Globalization
[[comparison_of_india_and_china | China]]'s success relied heavily on the strategic generosity of the United States, which created a [[challenges_facing_globalization | globalized system]] allowing for global import and export without military securing of territory or sea lanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This system, established after World War II and solidified when Nixon visited Mao to engineer the Soviet-Sino split, made [[comparison_of_india_and_china | China]] an ally of the U.S. during the Cold War, creating its manufacturing powerhouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

However, the U.S. now views [[comparison_of_india_and_china | China]] as a rival and is actively dismantling its role in the [[Chinese economic model | Chinese economic model]] through measures in agriculture, energy, and semiconductors, potentially crippling [[Challenges facing Chinas future | China's economic future]] by restricting exports, imports, and market access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

In contrast, India never fully joined this U.S.-led [[challenges_facing_globalization | internationalized system]], remaining pro-Soviet during the Cold War and retaining some pro-Russian tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. While this meant India missed out on the rapid growth [[comparison_of_india_and_china | China]] experienced from the 1980s to the 2010s, resulting in a much smaller [[Indias demographic and industrial growth potential | Indian economy]], it also means India is largely unaffected as the [[challenges_facing_globalization | globalized system]] retreats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Hyper-Financialization
[[comparison_of_india_and_china | China]]'s second factor for success was hyper-financialization, where the state confiscates public savings and floods projects with money, providing bottomless zero-percent loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. While this generates [[comparison_of_india_and_china | economic growth]], it is wildly inefficient and often non-productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. When this system collapses, as it inevitably will, it won't just be a [[Demographic and economic challenges facing China | financial and housing crisis]] but an "everything crisis," with agriculture being the most exposed sector, potentially leading to famine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

India does not face this problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. The [[Indias demographic and industrial growth potential | Indian system]] is capital-poor, with low capital availability per person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This forces Indians to treat capital as an economic good, as it should be, rather than a political good to be thrown at projects as in [[comparison_of_india_and_china | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. While this limits immediate growth, it ensures greater stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Demographics
[[Demographic and economic challenges facing China | China's demographic challenges]] include a significant "hollowing out" of its population structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. In contrast, this has not happened in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. While India is also industrializing and seeing demographic shifts towards a "chimney" shape (similar numbers of people across age groups), the process started much later and is proceeding slower than in [[comparison_of_india_and_china | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:04:06]</a>.

India is currently experiencing rapid aging, but from a very late start and at a relatively slow pace compared to its peers and especially to [[comparison_of_india_and_china | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This means India still has a large population under 40 for consumption and potential future births <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. In the next 10-40 years, India will have a significant number of people aged 40 to 65 who will be capital-rich and contribute high value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Even if only 10% of India's 1.5 billion people fall into this category, it represents a substantial demographic advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

Even in a worst-case scenario where birth rates continue to shrink and the [[Indias demographic and industrial growth potential | Indian population]] continues to age, India is projected to remain the world's largest population for at least another half-century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. India is not expected to face a European-style demographic crunch for at least 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Therefore, even with challenges, the [[Indias demographic and industrial growth potential | future of India]] appears promising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

## Geographic and Strategic Advantages

India possesses distinct geographic and strategic advantages that [[comparison_of_india_and_china | China]] lacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Australia is a much more friendly nation to India than to [[comparison_of_india_and_china | China]], ensuring access to additional food and mineral supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Furthermore, the Indian subcontinent is the first stop out of the Persian Gulf, making India one of the last countries expected to experience an [[Energy strategies in India | energy crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. In contrast, [[comparison_of_india_and_china | China]] is at the end of a very long and easily disrupted supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

## Survivable Challenges

While India faces traditional issues such as inefficiency, women's rights concerns and their impact on [[Indias demographic and industrial growth potential | economic growth]], the proximity of Pakistan, and corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:06:10]</a>, these problems are considered an order of magnitude less severe than those currently afflicting [[Demographic and economic challenges facing China | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. These challenges are survivable, and India can cope with them as it continues to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:25]</a>.

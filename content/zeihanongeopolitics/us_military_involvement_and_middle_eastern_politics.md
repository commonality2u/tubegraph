On February 5th, Iranian-backed militants in [[US involvement in the Middle East and challenges in global security|Syria]] attacked a [[US military power and economic influence|US]] base, marking the first significant attack since three American soldiers were killed the previous week [00:00:07]. This incident resulted in a drone hitting barracks, killing half a dozen Kurds that [[US military power and economic influence|US]] Special Forces were training [00:00:27]. This event highlights the complex and challenging [[US involvement in the Middle East and challenges in global security|US involvement in the Middle East]], a region that has historically been difficult to navigate and extricate from [00:00:43].

## Historical Context of the Middle East

For approximately a thousand years, from roughly 1000 AD to 1500 AD, the [[economic_and_military_relationships_in_the_middle_east|Middle East]] served as an intermediary region for trade between more technologically advanced societies in the West and East Asia [00:00:51]. Goods like spices, porcelain, and silks traveled via coastal vessels, camels, and caravans [00:01:16]. However, these routes involved numerous intermediaries, leading to massive markupsâ€”costs often increasing by a factor of a thousand [00:01:44].

### The Age of Exploration and the Middle East's Decline
The Spanish and Portuguese developed deep-water navigation technologies around 1500 AD, enabling them to bypass the [[economic_and_military_relationships_in_the_middle_east|Middle East]] entirely by sailing directly to the East [00:02:41]. Consequently, from roughly 1500 until 1900, the [[economic_and_military_relationships_in_the_middle_east|Middle East]] became a "complete Backwater" [00:03:17].

### Geographic Factors and Industrialization
The West, particularly Europe, benefited from consistent rainfall, allowing for diverse agriculture and fostering economic pursuits and political stability [00:03:49]. Winters also provided off-season opportunities for farmers, leading to an increase in the population's overall skill level [00:04:03]. In contrast, the [[economic_and_military_relationships_in_the_middle_east|Middle East]] has very few areas with rain, concentrating water resources along coasts or rivers [00:04:24]. This allowed political authorities to easily dominate populations, often reducing them to "slave status" and hindering technological advancement or societal investment in stability [00:04:30]. While centers of learning preserved Western knowledge during the Dark Ages, they did not apply or disseminate it within their own cultures [00:05:01].

By the time Western countries industrialized and developed technologies like gunpowder and cannons, the [[economic_and_military_relationships_in_the_middle_east|Middle East]] was left far behind [00:05:24]. Western powers like the British and French eventually divided the region into mandates and colonies [00:03:35].

## The Modern Era: Oil and Instability

The [[economic_and_military_relationships_in_the_middle_east|Middle East]] regained global significance after 1900, largely due to [[middle_east_geopolitics_and_oil_reliance|oil]] [00:05:39]. While North America is self-sufficient in [[middle_east_geopolitics_and_oil_reliance|oil]], European nations are heavily reliant on [[middle_east_geopolitics_and_oil_reliance|Middle Eastern]] [[middle_east_geopolitics_and_oil_reliance|oil]], especially since [[implications_of_russian_military_presence_in_the_middle_east|Russian]] crude is no longer part of their supply equation [00:06:09].

After 1950, the [[economic_and_military_relationships_in_the_middle_east|Middle East]] transformed due to the introduction of industrial technologies [00:06:19]. The region's governing systems, historically "Fortress political systems" like Damascus, Egypt, or Iran, became more vulnerable [00:07:00]. Industrialization brought roads and military hardware, creating brittle, top-down political systems that struggled to provide technological progress to their populations beyond [[middle_east_geopolitics_and_oil_reliance|oil]] wealth [00:07:33]. This environment, combined with weak societal structures, fosters the proliferation of militant groups [00:08:09].

> "You get this incredibly brittle top down concentrated political system that is absolutely incapable of providing the people with a level of technological progress that is possible elsewhere in the world because there's very little to work from aside from cash from [[middle_east_geopolitics_and_oil_reliance|oil]] and you apply that in a world where Society is weak uh well and the result you get lots and lots and lots and lots of militant groups..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>

## [[US involvement in the Middle East and challenges in global security|US Involvement Post-9/11]]

Following the 9/11 attacks, the [[political_influences_on_military_strategy|Bush Administration]] aimed to combat [[the_impact_of_us_disengagement_from_the_middle_east|Al-Qaeda]] by ensuring countries that harbored the group would pursue them [00:08:36]. After operations in [[US involvement in major conflicts|Afghanistan]], it was found that [[the_impact_of_us_disengagement_from_the_middle_east|Al-Qaeda]] recruits came from [[US involvement in the Middle East and challenges in global security|Syria]], Taliban troops fled through Iran, and elements within Saudi Arabia provided ideological and financial support [00:08:48].

Conquering all three nations was deemed too difficult [00:09:30]. The strategy chosen was to invade and occupy [[US involvement in major conflicts|Iraq]] with armored tank brigades [00:09:44]. The intent was to deter Iran, Damascus, and Riyadh by demonstrating that the [[US military power and economic influence|US]] could easily turn on them [00:09:57]. This strategy worked, leading these three countries to actively pursue [[the_impact_of_us_disengagement_from_the_mole_east|Al-Qaeda]], effectively ending the group's significant threat [00:10:29]. However, the [[US military power and economic influence|US]] then attempted to transform [[US involvement in major conflicts|Iraq]] into a Western-style democracy, which failed due to a lack of societal foundation, leading to chaos [00:10:41].

### The "Forever Wars" Dilemma
Subsequent [[US policy shift in the Middle East|US]] administrations, including Obama's and [[US policy shift in the Middle East|Trump]]'s, continued to maintain a military presence, particularly in places like [[US involvement in the Middle East and challenges in global security|Syria]] to fight [[the_impact_of_us_disengagement_from_the_middle_east|Isis]] [00:11:10]. The core issue is that countries in the region lack the foundational elements to form a stable nation-state as understood by Westerners [00:11:30]. If the goal is to prevent the resurgence of specific types of militancy, the [[US military power and economic influence|US]] would have to remain indefinitely, leading to what have been called "forever wars" [00:11:42].

> "If your goal is to prevent the creation or the operation or the Resurgence of a specific type of militancy you will be there forever and that's one of the reasons why we called them the forever Wars because we found ourselves going to war with a military tactic as opposed to any specific group..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>

## Options for [[US Military Power and Economic Influence|US Policy]]

The [[US military power and economic influence|US]] faces a difficult choice in the [[economic_and_military_relationships_in_the_middle_east|Middle East]]:

### Option A: Stick it out forever
This involves hunkering down in bases, watching for groups like [[the_impact_of_us_disengagement_from_the_middle_east|Isis]] to "bubble up," striking them, and then returning to bases [00:12:39]. This strategy means remaining in the region indefinitely, exposed to militant groups, such as the Iranian-backed instigators seen recently [00:12:55]. This is described as the "new normal" or even the "old normal" for the region [00:13:09].

### Option B: Leave
From a casualty perspective, leaving is easy [00:13:16]. However, the danger is that more militant groups could emerge, not just attacking locals but also [[US military power and economic influence|US]] interests [00:13:48]. This theory, however, assumes that the [[US military power and economic influence|US]] presence actively improves the situation [00:13:56].

Ironically, the remaining [[US military power and economic influence|US]] forces in the region have become the primary reason the government in Damascus still exists [00:14:56]. Without the [[US military power and economic influence|US]], regional powers like [[implications_of_russian_military_presence_in_the_middle_east|Turkey]], [[US involvement in the Middle East and challenges in global security|Syria]], and Israel would become more aggressively involved in dealing with militant groups [00:14:39]. This could lead to the end of the [[US involvement in the Middle East and challenges in global security|Syrian]] government within five years, although it would be "bloody and horrible" [00:15:31].

### The Looming Threat
The [[economic_and_military_relationships_in_the_middle_east|Middle East]] struggles to grow its own food and relies on [[middle_east_geopolitics_and_oil_reliance|oil]] exports to import necessities [00:15:42]. This makes the capacity for an "outright civilizational collapse" very real [00:15:51]. The presence of [[US military power and economic influence|US]] forces is one of the few elements "holding the Darkness at Bay" [00:15:58]. The question remains whether this role aligns with American national interests [00:16:02].

The American Southwest faces a significant [[water_scarcity_in_the_american_southwest | water problem]], rooted in its arid terrain and reliance on fickle orographic precipitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Historically, the region has experienced [[historical_context_of_southwest_droughts | mega droughts]] leading to [[historical_context_of_southwest_droughts | civilizational breakdown events]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, and the region is currently in [[historical_context_of_southwest_droughts | one of those periods]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Origins and Flaws of the Compact

Recognizing the limited [[water]] supply, the states of the American Southwest established the Colorado River Compact in 1922 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. However, a major flaw was that the year chosen to assess water availability for sharing was one of the wettest on record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This means the water volumes stipulated in the treaty were never consistently available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Senior Water Rights

The Compact's legal framework includes "senior water rights," which prioritize urban centers that existed at the time of the 1922 treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Any infrastructure built to tap into the water network since then holds a lower priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

California, particularly Los Angeles, which had a large population in 1922, holds senior water rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. In contrast, Arizona, which completed its Central Arizona Project in the late 1960s and 70s, is at the very bottom of the junior water rights stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. A Supreme Court ruling affirmed California's senior water rights, allowing Arizona's water demand to potentially go to zero before California has to cut at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

### California's Refusal to Negotiate

With the Supreme Court ruling in its favor, California has refused to negotiate with other states in the Colorado River Basin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Despite an offer from other states to significantly cut their demand if California made a moderate reduction, California refused, stating that other states should "go to zero and die" while it maintains its current water usage, including for golf courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Potential Compact Breakdown

The upstream states are now debating whether to walk away from the Compact entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. While this would likely lead to California suing them in a court case they would probably lose, the litigation would take years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. In the interim, Southern California, which receives about a third of its water from the Colorado River, would go completely dry, leading to massive [[economic_and_industrial_implications_of_water_shortages | economic dislocation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Broader Implications of the Water Crisis

The ongoing [[water_scarcity_in_the_american_southwest | Water Crisis]] has significant implications for the United States:

*   **Industrial Reshoring:** As the world [[economic_and_industrial_implications_of_water_shortages | deglobalizes]], the U.S. aims to rebuild its domestic [[economic_and_industrial_implications_of_water_shortages | industrial plant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The Southwest, despite its water issues, is ideal for high-value industries like [[economic_and_industrial_implications_of_water_shortages | semiconductor fabrication facilities]] in Phoenix and restoring the [[economic_and_industrial_implications_of_water_shortages | electronic supply chain system]] due to its varied workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. However, these require significant water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. The U.S.-Mexico border region, similar to East Asia's diverse labor markets, is uniquely suited for [[economic_and_industrial_implications_of_water_shortages | manufacturing of electronics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, but this depends on water availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **[[economic_and_industrial_implications_of_water_shortages | Agriculture]] and Food Security:** The Southwest grows a significant amount of food in the desert, which is now part of the national [[economic_and_industrial_implications_of_water_shortages | food security system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Places like Yuma, Arizona, rely entirely on these water courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. A breakdown of the Compact could lead to losing 25% to 33% of the nation's fresh vegetables in winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. California's Central Valley also faces its own, unrelated, ecological and agricultural crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Demographic Shifts:** The American Southwest has been the fastest-growing part of the country for roughly 50 years due to in-migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Baby Boomers seek warmer climates, and Millennials desire more affordable elbow room, larger yards, and less reliance on mass transit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This growth is unlikely to change unless a persistent [[water_scarcity_in_the_american_southwest | Water Crisis]] occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

## Necessary Solutions

To manage the [[water]] situation, several actions can be taken:
*   Remove water-intensive agriculture from the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   Eliminate non-essential water uses, such as golf courses and fountains in cities like Phoenix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   Implement modern water resource management technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

Above all, the Colorado Compact must be renegotiated to reflect a more realistic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Since California is unwilling to do so voluntarily, it will need to be forced, either through a crisis triggered by upstream states or by Congress abrogating the Compact and imposing a new replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. This will be an unavoidable and contentious political issue in the coming years, but it is critical for the Southwest to benefit from ongoing demographic and geopolitical shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

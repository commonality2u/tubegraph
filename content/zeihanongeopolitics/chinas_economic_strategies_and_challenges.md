The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently issued its least optimistic economic forecast in 50 years, predicting a global growth rate of 2.8% for the next year and 3% for the next five years, a projection that may still be overly optimistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Within this global context, China faces significant economic hurdles.

## Historical Economic Performance

For much of the last 40 years, China has maintained growth rates above 8%, significantly higher than the typical 2% for the rich world and 4-7% for the developing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Even accounting for potentially unreliable data, China's growth has historically been on the high end among poorer nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. However, current projections suggest a growth rate of around 4% may be the best achievable now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Current Economic Challenges

China is grappling with a combination of difficulties seen in both developed and developing economies, leading to what is described as "the worst of all worlds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### [[Chinas demographic challenges | Demographic Challenges]]

Like developed nations, China is facing a "demographic bomb," experiencing a much steeper decline in birth rates than any other country globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This means China is likely to "get old before it gets rich" and achieves first-world living standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. As a result, the consumption-led growth typically seen in developed economies cannot be sustained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Furthermore, the export-led growth that relied on selling products to the rest of the world is also hampered by lower global growth elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

### Infrastructure Investment and Debt

China has historically followed a developing-world strategy, investing heavily in infrastructure projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. However, China already possesses extensive infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. As Japan discovered in the 1990s and 2000s, building more infrastructure when existing infrastructure is already good does not generate significant additional economic growth beyond the initial construction phase, as there is no further need for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This long-standing strategy has led China to amass a massive debt load, estimated to be around 300-350% of its GDP, a "world record" that is unsustainable in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

### Loss of American Sponsorship

A critical factor behind China's economic success over recent decades has been "de facto American sponsorship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. This sponsorship provided China with risk-free, secure, and inexpensive access to global energy, commodities, and consumer markets without requiring significant effort on their part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. This arrangement is "clearly not in the cards anymore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, removing a key pillar of China's past growth.

## Outlook

With economic growth rates projected to be lower globally for the foreseeable future, China's situation is particularly challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. The world is experiencing an "unwinding of the globalized world" from both geographic and [[Chinas demographic challenges | demographic]] perspectives, which naturally leads to lower growth rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. While some countries like Vietnam, Mexico, and the United States may see growth due to trends like nearshoring and reshoring of manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, this implies that economies like China, Korea, and Germany will face significant downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

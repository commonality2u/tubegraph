Finland has a long history of military preparedness, shaped by its proximity to Russia and a strategic focus on defense. Until recently, Finland maintained official neutrality, primarily due to a historical fear of facing the Soviet Union and, later, Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This stance was not born from a perception of weakness, but from the understanding that Finland would be significantly outnumbered in a direct conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## The Winter War (1939-1940)
A pivotal moment in Finland's military history is the Winter War, a chapter of World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. During this conflict, Finnish forces inflicted heavy casualties on Stalin's troops, achieving casualty ratios of 20-to-1 or even 41-to-1 throughout the winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This success was partly attributed to the Finnish military's ability to ski through Russian forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. However, once the snow melted and this advantage was lost, Finland was compelled to sue for peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. The subsequent peace deal required Finland to cede territory where approximately a quarter of its pre-war population resided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

This loss left a lasting impact, with Finns never forgetting the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Consequently, the Finnish military has since prepared almost exclusively for a single scenario: a potential conflict with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

## Modern Military Capabilities
Finland is recognized as a creative country that consistently punches above its weight in military affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. It arguably possesses the most effective military on a per capita basis within [[natos_task_force_in_the_baltic_and_its_implications | NATO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

Since joining [[natos_task_force_in_the_baltic_and_its_implications | NATO]], Finland has begun training with other member states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Their inherent skills were recently demonstrated by winning the biathlon competition last winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. These natural aptitudes as sharpshooters and skiers contributed significantly to the high casualty ratios observed during the Winter War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## Alliances and Regional Cooperation
Finland does not stand alone. It has close military relationships with its "little brothers"â€”[[estonias_cyber_defense_strategies | Estonia]], Latvia, and Lithuania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. More significantly, Finland maintains excellent relations with its [[finlands_alliances_with_scandinavian_countries | Scandinavian]] cousins: Denmark, Sweden, and Norway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Beyond the Nordic region, Finland also has strong ties with the United Kingdom and, more recently, the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

The recent actions by [[russia_and_chinas_actions_against_finland | Russia and China against Finland]], which involved funneling illegal migrants and damaging subsea infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, indicate a breakdown in Russian diplomatic and security decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Russia seemingly targeted Finland, believing it to be isolated, forgetting that even Stalin was somewhat intimidated by the Finns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

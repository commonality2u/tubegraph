Reports in late June indicated that the [[ukrainian_counteroffensive_in_the_war | Ukrainian counteroffensive]] was not progressing particularly well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. As of the third week of June, Ukraine had not achieved any significant breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Early Challenges and Russian Defenses
The Russian forces established two main lines of defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>:
1.  **Minefields** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>
2.  **Strategic Defensive Emplacements** - including "dragon's teeth" and trenches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>

Ukrainian forces initially struggled to bypass these minefields to reach the main defenses, resulting in attritional fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Given Russia's larger industrial capacity, reserves, and population (a factor of three times more), attrition battles are disadvantageous for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. A battle where Ukraine only kills three times as many Russians as their own losses is still considered a loss for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Unlike the rapid breakthroughs seen in Kherson and Kharkiv, this phase was characterized as a "slugfest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

Despite the initial slow progress, the offensive was still in its early stages, with Ukrainian forces probing for weaknesses and targeting Russian command and control systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Strategic Shifts and Supply Line Disruption
A significant shift in [[ukrainian_military_strategy and offensive preparations | Ukrainian strategy]] occurred in the 96 hours leading up to June 23rd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Targeting Ammunition Dumps
Ukraine shifted from primarily targeting command and control systems with missiles to striking ammunition dumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This indicates moving to a new operational phase, aiming to not just disrupt Russian forces but to cut off their meaningful supplies after perceiving Russian reaction capabilities as broken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### Critical Bridge Strikes
On June 22nd, Ukraine targeted critical supply bridges for Russian forces, notably the Chonhar Crossing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

#### The Kerch Bridge
The Kerch Bridge, attacked previously (unclaimed) by either the US or Ukraine, serves as a vital link to Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. It consists of two two-lane road connections and one rail connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. An attack in the summer of 2022 disabled one road connection and warped the rail bridge, making it unusable for cargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. This forced Russia to reroute supplies to land connections into Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Months after the attack, the rail connection has still not been rebuilt, highlighting Russia's struggle with technical expertise due to decades of educational and demographic crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

#### The Chonhar Crossing
The Chonhar Crossing, located to the east, includes both rail and road connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Ukrainian forces used a special warhead to create large holes through the concrete and rebar, rendering the bridge unusable for trucks and rail traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Repairs are expected to take weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

The strategic goal of these attacks is to isolate Russian troops west of Mariupol, who primarily received supplies from Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. With the Chonhar Bridge offline, supplies must be rerouted further west, significantly increasing the travel distance and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. This creates a window of vulnerability where Russian troops will lack reinforcements, fuel, and ammunition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### Geographic Objectives
The primary objective of the [[potential_ukrainian_counteroffensive | Ukrainian counteroffensive]] is to reach the Sea of Azov, anywhere between Mariupol and Melitopol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Achieving this would:
*   Isolate the entire southwestern front and Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   Cut the land bridge between Russia proper and Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   Enable Ukraine to directly target the Kerch Strait Bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

These actions create conditions favorable for a significant [[ukrainian_counteroffensive plans | Ukrainian counteroffensive]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

## The Nuclear Question and International Borders
The [[potential_ukrainian_ground_assault_strategies | Ukrainian counteroffensive]] also raises critical political and strategic questions, particularly concerning Russia's potential use of nuclear weapons if its perceived sovereign territory is threatened.

### US Senate Resolution
On June 22nd, Senators Blumenthal (Democrat, Connecticut) and Graham (Republican, South Carolina) introduced a joint resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. This resolution states that any Russian or Belarusian use of:
*   A strategic or tactical nuclear weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>
*   Actions causing a meltdown at a nuclear power plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>
would be considered an act of war under Article 5 of NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

While this resolution is merely a statement of intent and lacks legal weight (Article 5 interpretation is an executive privilege and an allied decision), it aims to warn Russia's leadership and military that such actions would initiate direct military conflict with the United States and its allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

### Crimea and Russian Perception
Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and considers it an integral part of its territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. This creates a "gray zone" where Russia might consider a push towards Crimea to be a "real war" warranting the use of defensive nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. While no country, including China, recognizes Russia's annexation of Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>, Russia's internal perception matters in terms of potential escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

### [[ukrainian_offensive_into_russia | Ukrainian Offensive into Russia]]
Ultimately, for Ukraine to win the war, it may need to cross the internationally recognized border into Russia proper to target logistical hubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. This action would clearly trigger the question of Russia's use of "defensive nuclear weapons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

The Senators' resolution is seen as a crucial step in initiating a necessary conversation about [[us_military_strategy_in_the_ukraine_war | strategic nuclear policy]] concerning Russia, a discussion largely absent since the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. President Biden's long experience with nuclear policy is noted as a unique advantage for navigating this complex issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

In late June, the conflict appeared to be on the verge of entering a new stage, requiring deeper strategic considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

China is reportedly stockpiling various essential resources like food, fuel, and materials, with the aim of enduring a [[potential_conflicts_with_russia_and_china | protracted conflict with the United States]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. However, experts suggest this strategy is unlikely to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## China's Economic and Material Vulnerabilities

China is inherently vulnerable due to its reliance on external resources and markets:
*   **Import Dependency** China is the world's largest importer of energy, foodstuffs, materials needed for food production, and nearly every mineral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Very little raw material is produced within China itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Its economy relies on importing raw goods, processing them into value-added manufactured goods, and then exporting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This makes China susceptible to disruptions at all stages of its production chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Storage Limitations**
    *   **Fuel Storage** While China aims for 120 days of import cover for oil, it lacks the natural salt domes available in the United States for secure, underground storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Much of China's fuel storage must be above ground, making it vulnerable to missile strikes and potentially destroyed within the first days of a "hot war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. These [[potential_consequences_for_chinas_economy_due_to_oil_supply_disruptions | oil supply disruptions]] could severely cripple its economy.
    *   **Food Storage** Similar issues plague food storage. Past attempts, such as a massive corn storage facility, resulted in large piles of corn rotting by the roadside within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Strategic Naval Vulnerability

China's reliance on imports makes it highly vulnerable to U.S. sea power, not only near its coast but globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The Strait of Malacca is a particularly sensitive choke point, as approximately 80% of China's oil imports transit through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Export Dependency

Despite any stockpiling efforts, China still needs to export goods to pay for its imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The United States is China's primary customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, highlighting the criticality of [[chinas_trade_relationship_with_the_united_states | China's trade relationship with the United States]].

## Flaws in China's Conflict Strategy

China's perceived military strategy during a conflict with the U.S. appears to be based on several unrealistic assumptions:
*   The U.S. Navy would operate primarily within range of Chinese air forces near the shore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   The U.S. would continue to patrol global oceans, ensuring China's continued access to food and energy imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   The U.S. market would remain open for Chinese exports, allowing China to finance its imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

This plan has been characterized as "stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, suggesting that if a genuine conflict were to occur between the two nations, China would face severe, unsustainable challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

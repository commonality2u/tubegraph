The ongoing conflict has severely impacted the Russian military's resources, leading to significant equipment and manpower shortages. This has forced Russia to activate deep reserves and rely on older equipment, affecting its operational capabilities and long-term sustainability.

## Equipment Shortages: The Case of the T-55 Tanks

At the end of March, Ukrainian forces "massacred" a group of Russian forces, specifically elements of the 76th Guards Air Assault Group, in Zarit Province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The 76th Guards are considered some of Russia's better troops, having been part of the pre-war military formations with generally superior equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

However, in this recent engagement, these elite forces were reportedly fighting with T-55 tanks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The T-55 tanks, built in the 1950s at the beginning of the Cold War, are considered outdated by Russian standards by over half a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

Key disadvantages of the T-55 include:
*   Slower movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>
*   Shorter shooting range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>
*   Thinner armor compared to modern tanks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>
*   Requires four personnel to operate, instead of three for modern tanks, making them more manpower-intensive for less effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>

The deployment of T-55s by elite units signals a significant issue for the Russian military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Depletion of Active and Reserve Tank Fleets
At the start of the war, Russia possessed approximately 12,000 tanks, with about 2,000 in active service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The presence of T-55s among elite groups indicates that the original 2,000 active tanks are now "incapacitated or more likely just flat out destroyed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

While Russia has a large reserve of an additional 10,000 tanks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, their refurbishment process is complex:
*   **T-55s (older models):** These tanks predate modern optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. They can be quickly refurbished by adding "cheap Optics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **T-72s and newer tanks:** These models originally had optics, but after 30 years in storage, their seals and wiring have deteriorated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Replacing these components requires more advanced equipment, which Russia increasingly lacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

Consequently, Russia is prioritizing the refurbishment of older tanks like the T-55 due to the relative ease of updating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The "entire pre-war tank reserve" is now gone, meaning all newly deployed tanks require refurbishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Manpower Shortages and Recruitment Challenges

The situation with personnel mirrors that of equipment. Estimates suggest that between 550,000 and 750,000 Russians have been killed or incapacitated by the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. This figure represents "the entire pre-war Army" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

Russia is now forced to deploy recently drafted individuals with minimal training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. While Russia maintains a "silent draft" of 15,000 to 45,000 people unofficially drafted every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, this source is not inexhaustible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

Demographic impact:
*   At the start of the war, Russia had approximately 8 million men in their 20s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   With roughly 600,000 killed or incapacitated and another million having fled, this pool is now down to about 6.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

Based on current rates of attrition for tanks and men, Russia could potentially sustain the war at its current pace for another 5 to 8 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Beyond this period, they would face severe shortages of both equipment and personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This suggests Russia is entering the "Twilight of the Russian system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Strategic Implications

The depletion of pre-war reserves means Russia can no longer shuffle resources from other parts of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. The military is now entirely dependent on continuous "throughput" for refurbishment, training, and equipment, including supplies from other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

This dependency means that [[collapse_of_russian_technical_expertise_and_economic_implications | economic and political factors]] both within Russia and internationally now "massively affect the pipeline" that sustains the Russian military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Russia currently lacks any strategic depth; as soon as resources or personnel become available, they are immediately deployed to the front to prevent it from emptying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

While Russia may have experienced some recent momentum, they have been unable to capitalize on breakthroughs, such as the Avdiivka front, which has become static again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Attacks, such as those involving the 76th Guards, are attempts to find weak points, but these troops are being "cut up" and the pace is unsustainable indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Despite these challenges, Russia could potentially maintain this level of conflict for another 5 to 8 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

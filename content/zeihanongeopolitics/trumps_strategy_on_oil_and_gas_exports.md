From: [[zeihanongeopolitics]] <br/> 

Former President Donald Trump proposed that European nations should acquire American oil and gas to address their trade deficit with the United States and to solidify the alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. While the speaker normally refrains from commenting on Trump's statements due to their frequent lack of follow-through and his tendency to appoint "functional incompetence" to his cabinet, this specific idea presents an interesting hypothetical for a world undergoing significant reshaping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## European Energy Consumption

Europe, defined broadly to include the Balkans, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and all of the European Union, consumes approximately 13 million barrels of crude oil per day (including refined products) and about 45 billion cubic feet of natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This consumption represents roughly 50% to 60% of what the [[shifts_in_us_energy_independence_and_its_global_implications | United States]] uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Despite having a larger population than the [[shifts_in_us_energy_independence_and_its_global_implications | United States]], Europe's economy is smaller and less energy-intensive due to a lower emphasis on manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Much of Europe is currently de-industrializing due to shortages in energy, workers, and finance, a trend linked to demographic factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## US Capacity and Export Implications

For the [[shifts_in_us_energy_independence_and_its_global_implications | United States]] to fuel Europe, it would need to increase its oil production by 2-4 million barrels per day, a level projected to occur within the next five years regardless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. For natural gas, significant liquefied natural gas (LNG) export capacity would be required, potentially doubling or tripling current levels, with enough projects in the pipeline for this to materialize over the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

However, dedicating all US energy exports to Europe would necessitate redirecting supply from current major destinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Mexico is currently the top destination for US energy exports; without these, roughly half of Mexico's electricity generation would cease, and its manufacturing system, reliant on American natural gas and over a million barrels per day of crude and refined products, would be disrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Japan is the second-largest destination and is considered a tighter ally than many European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Shifting existing sales to a new market would merely create a different numbers problem, highlighting a common flaw in Trump's thinking where he assumes individual issues are isolated rather than interconnected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Strategic Alliance in a De-globalizing World

The core issue behind such a proposal is not a trade deficit, but rather a strategic block in a world where globalization is ending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. The [[shifts_in_us_energy_independence_and_its_global_implications | United States]] will likely have no difficulty finding buyers for its commodity exports, but the challenge lies in which nations can afford or securely access these materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. A strategic decision to support Europe with energy could be made based on strengthening alliances and encouraging the continued existence of key partners in a de-globalizing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

Providing all US energy exports to Europe could create a viable "cultural West" bloc that includes North America and Europe, considered potentially the most powerful option in a world fragmenting into factions and regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Such an alliance could contain Russia, offer influence in the Middle East without direct involvement, and leverage shared cultural history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This would allow for potential fusion in agriculture, manufacturing, and military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

However, dedicating all energy resources to Europe would mean foregoing similar support for other advanced countries like Korea and Japan, or rapidly growing regions like Southeast Asia (Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, Indonesia, Malaysia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. The [[shifts_in_us_energy_independence_and_its_global_implications | United States]] will need to make difficult choices about its alliances in a de-globalizing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Focusing on Europe, a region facing a "demographic bomb," might not be the most impactful investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. For example, Germany's industrial base is projected to collapse within a decade due to energy and workforce issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. As the Euro Zone faces challenges, the [[shifts_in_us_energy_independence_and_its_global_implications | United States]] may opt to work with individual European countries like France, the UK, Spain, or Central European nations, or even Italy due to its favorable geography for power projection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

## Challenges in Policy Implementation Under Trump

The speaker notes that policies suggested by Donald Trump often do not come to fruition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Statements, often made on social media, typically do not progress beyond the initial announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This is exacerbated by his tendency to appoint cabinet members who are "functionally not competent" in their roles, particularly in domestic policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The primary purpose of serving in Trump's cabinet is often to affirm his ego, leading to high turnover; in his first term, he had more cabinet secretaries than the previous three American presidents combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This high turnover prevents meaningful policy discussion, formation, and implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

Trump is criticized as a "horrible personnel manager," a trait shared with former President Barack Obama, whose micromanagement and aversion to interaction led to minimal legislative and foreign policy outcomes during his eight years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. This indicates that for the past 16 years, under [[comparison_of_trump_and_bidens_foreign_policies | Trump Biden Obama]], despite a world falling apart and globalization ending, there has been a lack of leadership to guide crucial regionalization decisions into policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

While the specific idea of Europe purchasing American energy may not be a complete solution, it is praised for initiating a necessary conversation about potential strategic alliances and global realignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

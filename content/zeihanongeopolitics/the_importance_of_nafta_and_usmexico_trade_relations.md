Historically, American foreign and strategic policy operated under a "bipartisan consensus" that sought to build a global alliance network and pursue free trade to secure national security and economic well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This consensus involved major alliances like NATO and those with Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, and encouraged a globalized world where countries benefited from participating in American security agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. However, this bipartisan consensus has "withered away" since 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, leading the United States into a period of international flux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Unpredictability in US Foreign Policy

Most US foreign policy is a presidential prerogative, with Congress having limited say in its formative stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Given the limited experience and track record of potential future presidents (Kamala Harris and JD Vance), their priorities and reactions to hypothetical scenarios are unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

The only foreign policies likely to persist are those where the president has ceded authority to Congress, locking them in with an act of Congress that limits presidential maneuverability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. This is a very short list, predominantly related to trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## The Significance of NAFTA

The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) stands out as the most important policy in this category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The renegotiation of NAFTA (often referred to as NAFTA 2) under Donald Trump is described as "brilliant" because it was "the right thing at the right time with the right partner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

[[MexicoUnited States relations and drug cartels | Mexico]] has become the United States' number one trade partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. If the United States seeks an economic future outside of a "dangerous and unequal relationship with [[Chinas trade relationship with the United States | China]]", [[MexicoUnited States relations and drug cartels | Mexico]] will be at its core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. The fact that the renegotiation was completed by the isolationist right of the United States is seen as beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

Regardless of who becomes the next president, NAFTA is expected to remain stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. This is considered the single most important [[future_of_global_trade_and_regionalization_trends | foreign policy]] priority for the United States, especially as [[Chinas trade relationship with the United States | China]] becomes more belligerent and faces internal issues, and as European alliances fracture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. The work done on NAFTA is a crucial piece for the future of the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

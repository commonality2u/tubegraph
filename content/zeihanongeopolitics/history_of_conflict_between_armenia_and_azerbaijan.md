Armenia and Azerbaijan, two of the fifteen post-Soviet republics, have been embroiled in conflict since before the dissolution of the Soviet Union [00:00:08]. This long-standing animosity stems from their integrated geographic systems and historical shifts in population, leading to robust irredentist claims on each other's territories [00:00:31]. Access points to and from their core population centers intermingle, making security difficult for one if the other is not secure [00:00:47].

## The 1990s War

The conflict in the 1990s saw the Armenians, with backing and security guarantees from the Russians, launch a series of assaults on Azerbaijani positions [00:00:57]. Armenian forces often outmaneuvered the Azerbaijanis due to better-trained troops and higher morale, while Azerbaijani troops were considered largely incompetent [00:01:07]. As a result, Azerbaijan lost control of over a fifth of its territory, much of which remains occupied by Armenians today [00:01:16].

## Recent Developments and the Rise of Drone Warfare

A significant shift in the conflict occurred approximately two years ago when Azerbaijan acquired Turkish combat drones [00:01:29]. This led to a lightning conflict, lasting under a month, in which Azerbaijani forces decisively destroyed Armenian forces [00:01:34]. This conflict was notable as the first time drones were seen as a regular part of military policy, serving as the mainstay of the Azerbaijani effort, rather than merely for reconnaissance or assassinations [00:01:45]. Although Azerbaijani troops may have better equipment and training now compared to the 1990s, they are still considered broadly incompetent, limiting their ability to follow up on drone assaults [00:02:07].

## Current Geopolitical Shifts

Two major changes have influenced the current situation [00:02:21]:

### Azerbaijan's Military Preparedness
Azerbaijan has spent the last year training its regular forces, making them less "awful" than they used to be [00:02:22]. This improved capability suggests that if the war of two years ago were to repeat, Azerbaijan would be able to advance further and seize more territory [000:02:33].

### Weakening of Russia's Role as Armenia's Guarantor
Armenia's security guarantor, Russia, is heavily engaged in [[impact_of_russian_involvement_in_ukraine_on_armenia | Ukraine]] [00:02:44]. Russia has been steadily pulling troops from other operations globally, including Africa, NATO borders, and the Caucuses [00:02:54]. Concerns exist regarding whether Russian forces in Armenia can or will fight, if their equipment is still present, and if Russia has the capacity to engage in a second military conflict [00:03:10]. Furthermore, Russian forces lack a direct land connection to Armenia, needing to pass through Georgia or Azerbaijan, countries that might now be able to resist Russian transit [00:03:30].

## Armenia's Search for New Alliances

Given Russia's preoccupation, Armenia is seeking an alternative security guarantor, but options are limited [00:03:41].

*   **United States**: An alliance with the U.S. would likely require Armenia to return to the pre-1990s war status quo, meaning giving up all conquered land [00:03:51]. Azerbaijan already maintains good relations with the U.S. [00:03:54].
*   **Turkey**: Turkey is a close ally of Azerbaijan, making it an impractical choice for Armenia [00:04:07].
*   **Iran**: Despite Armenia being Christian and Iran being Muslim, the two have been de facto allies for most of the post-Soviet period [00:04:15]. Both Iran and Russia broadly view Turkey and the United States as problems [00:04:29]. Iran also has a significant [[ethnic_tensions_within_the_russian_federation | Azeri]] ethnic minority within its borders, leading to concerns about an independent Azerbaijan [00:04:34].

## [[influence_of_armenian_lobbying_in_us_politics | Armenian Lobby]] in US Politics

The [[influence_of_armenian_lobbying_in_us_politics | Armenian lobby]] in the United States is very powerful, deeply integrated into the U.S. State Department and Hollywood [00:04:54]. This influence has historically resulted in Armenia receiving substantial portions of the USAID budget, even when Armenians were the aggressors in the 1990s wars [000:05:09]. As Armenia seeks new alternatives, the powerful [[influence_of_armenian_lobbying_in_us_politics | Armenian lobby]] is poised to clash with the entrenched anti-Iranian lobby in the U.S. Congress, as their objectives on this topic are diametrically opposed [00:05:32].

## Strategic Corridors and Future Conflict Potential

In mountainous territories, control over access points is crucial for supplies, troops, transport, and economics [00:05:51]. Several corridors are disputed between Armenia and Azerbaijan [00:06:02]. If Azerbaijan succeeds in its objectives, it could cut the only significant connection between Armenia and Iran [00:06:09]. This action would likely trigger a response from Tehran, leading to complex and "delightfully lively" U.S. foreign and domestic political dynamics [00:06:17]. While a general assault by Azerbaijan is not anticipated, cutting a single corridor and stationing troops there to elicit responses from Turkey and the U.S. is considered a probable strategy [00:06:33].

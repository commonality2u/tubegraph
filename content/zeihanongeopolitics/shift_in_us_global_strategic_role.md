The global order is undergoing significant changes, impacting the United States' strategic relationships that defined the post-Cold War era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The US is reevaluating its global position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:55">[02:10:55]</a>, seeking to become a "free agent" again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. This [[shifts_in_us_foreign_policy_and_its_implications | shift in US foreign policy]] is not driven by a master plan, but rather a desire for disengagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

## Impact on Smaller Nations

Countries like New Zealand are affected by this [[shifts_in_us_foreign_policy_and_its_implications | changing global order]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Japan is highlighted as the only country that has successfully navigated this [[shifts_in_us_foreign_policy_and_its_implications | shift in US foreign policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. A few governments ago, Japan realized the Americans were losing interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Given its dependence on international trade for economic health, especially energy imports, Japan understood the need to enter the American inner circle by offering something the US wanted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This led to Japan seeking a deal with the United States on America's terms, involving trade concessions and a security partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

In contrast to the Cold War era, where the US provided economic and strategic concessions to build alliances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, a more disassociated America requires countries to offer incentives to maintain engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. For smaller, less capable countries than Japan, this challenge is even more pronounced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. These nations must be more aggressive and generous to keep the US interested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. New Zealand, being geographically isolated, faces fewer security concerns, and its primary interest will be economic, given its significant agricultural exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. However, for most other countries, securing US engagement is a much taller order, as the US is interested in very few things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Emerging Regional Powers in Europe

With the [[influence_of_global_dynamics_on_us_policy_priorities | US reevaluating its global position]] and the ongoing Ukraine-Russia War, the largest land conflict in Europe since World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>, regional powers in Europe are shifting their behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. France, Sweden, and Turkey are identified as the three countries that will matter for the remainder of this century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. These nations possess healthy demographies and a geography that allows them freedom to act beyond Europe's confines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>, unlike Spain, Germany, Italy, and eventually Poland, which will face demographic decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

The coordination or friction between these three powers will determine the future of NATO, the EU, and a post-unified Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.
*   **France and Sweden:** The French government is increasingly aligning its talking points with Sweden, which has historically focused on energy security and manufacturing self-sufficiency in opposition to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. With Sweden no longer neutral, the potential for a robust partnership exists, provided ego does not interfere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. Their coordination in Ukraine will set a pattern for their bilateral relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.
*   **Turkey:** Turkey originates from a distinct culture and has a unique, healthy economic structure, with a presence in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. There's been increased cooperation that did not exist decades ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. However, Turkey is a significant power in its neighborhood. If Russia loses the Ukraine war, Turkey has the opportunity for a massive geopolitical expansion, which could make other powers uneasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

This emerging dynamic could lead to a Swedish-German-French axis, with Germany as a junior and fading partner, while Turkey seeks to maximize its influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

## US Role in Global Shipping and the Middle East

The US has maintained global shipping and the [[post_american_strategic_order_and_nigeria | global order]] for nearly a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. Recent US Navy actions against the Houthis in the Red Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a> raise questions about whether the US is being pulled back into a role it is trying to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. This involvement is seen as a "placeholder" and a testing ground for American missile interdiction capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. It's proving difficult to prevent a hostile group from launching numerous weapon systems over a wide area, stretching US Naval capacities to their breaking point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>. US Naval commanders recognize that if a "real country" were to act on a broader scale, the US could do little to stop it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. The belief that the US can still patrol the global oceans is being challenged by modern technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.

Regarding the [[us_policy_shift_in_the_middle_east | US policy shift in the Middle East]], the US is unlikely to be drawn back into the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>. The Gaza conflict has underscored how little the US wants to be involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>. The US has been publicly stating its desire to withdraw from the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. The current discussions on arms transfers are forcing Israel to realize it is not a "golden child" or special exception that will keep the US involved in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>. This is prompting soul-searching within Israel, similar to how a Russian invasion changed minds in Europe about their defense posture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. There is a dawning realization globally that the United States is no longer the same power it was two decades ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>.

[[demographics_and_capital_availability | Capital availability]] significantly influences economic models and the development of the tech sector, particularly in regions like California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Determinants of Capital Availability
The availability of capital is primarily determined by the number of mature workers within a population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Younger demographics, typically those in their 20s and 30s, tend to borrow significantly for consumption, including college, raising children, and home purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The capital for these borrowings comes from individuals in their late 40s to early 60s, who are at the peak of their earning potential with reduced expenses, as their children have often left home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Historical Impact on Tech Development
Since approximately 1990, the Baby Boomer generation has served as this source of mature workers, fostering an environment of abundant capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This environment has been highly beneficial for economic development across various regions, states, and countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

In California, the confluence of this readily available capital and a large influx of Millennials seeking urban coastal experiences led to the emergence of the tech sector, specifically Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Technology, which involves imagining and creating things that don't yet exist, requires two critical components for its realization:
1.  **A large workforce of young individuals** in their 20s and 30s to conceptualize, design, prototype, and operationalize new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
2.  **Abundant and cheap capital** to fund these individuals and the developmental work, as the process from idea to operationalization typically generates no immediate income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

This combination of factors characterized California's economic landscape for the past 25 years, directly enabling the growth of Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. The ideas generated in Silicon Valley also facilitated the American de-industrialization process by designing new manufacturing processes applicable to East Asian economies like Japan, Korea, China, and Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Current Shifts and Future Implications
The capital situation has undergone a dramatic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The Baby Boomers are predominantly retired and no longer function as mature workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. As a result, capital costs have significantly increased, rising by a factor of five in the last 16 months, with further increases anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This escalation in capital costs has severely impacted the traditional model of Silicon Valley, which relied heavily on readily available and inexpensive capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

The evolving economic landscape suggests that regions previously thriving on cheap capital and ample labor, like California's tech sector, will need to innovate new economic models to adapt to these changing conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

On Canadian soil, the Indian government has been accused of assassinating a Sikh immigrant who had Canadian citizenship and had renounced his Indian citizenship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The individual was known to support a separatist group in India, an issue largely resolved in India's favor, but he continued to discuss it while abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This incident has significant ramifications, particularly for the Indian diaspora.

## Canada as a Hub for Indians

Canada is a prominent destination for Indian students and hosts the fastest-growing Indian ethnic group within its borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The Indian diaspora is considered arguably the largest on the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Expected Agitation and Publicity

The assassination is unlikely to quell discussions surrounding these topics; instead, it is expected to generate more agitation within Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. As a free country with a largely free press, Canada provides an environment where individuals can openly express opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Due to freedom of information and global communication, this incident will likely garner significant publicity even within India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## Broader Implications for the Diaspora

If the Indian government begins to "patrol" its diaspora using "extra Territorial and extra legal means," it could lead to widespread international friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This represents a new capacity for the Indian government, as it has not previously been observed assassinating individuals outside the immediate vicinity of its borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This development has the potential to become a very significant issue in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

The incident is a key part of the larger [[india_and_canadas_diplomatic_tensions_over_assassination | India and Canada's diplomatic tensions over assassination]] and has broader [[global_implications_of_indian_governments_actions_abroad | global implications of Indian government's actions abroad]].

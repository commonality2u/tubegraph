During the [[PostCold War global economic system | Cold War]], the United States maintained a military policy designed to be capable of fighting "two and a half wars" simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This policy envisioned the capability to engage in two major conflicts, primarily against the Soviets, while still reserving enough resources, or "dry powder," to manage a smaller "brush fire" conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Post-Cold War Shift
In the [[PostCold War global economic system | post-Cold War era]], this strategy was scaled down to focus on being able to fight one major conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This reduction reflected a shift where United States military assets became more concentrated and focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Current US Military Capabilities
Despite the historical shift, concerns regarding the [[US military strategy and current status | US military strategy and current status]] to handle simultaneous conflicts with Russia and China have been addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The current assessment suggests that the U.S. remains capable of managing such a scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### The Ukraine War Context
The [[US military strategy in the Ukraine war | US military strategy in the Ukraine war]] involves indirect support to Ukraine, largely due to the high risk of nuclear escalation if the U.S. were to become directly involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This strategy includes supplying the Ukrainians with military assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Much of the equipment transferred consists of older models from the 1970s and 1980s that were decommissioned in the 1990s and 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. These assets are not considered part of the United States' active military balance sheet and were largely material the U.S. had intended to dispose of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. In a peculiar sense, Ukraine's use of these assets saves the U.S. money on disposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

This approach means that the main U.S. Army's equipment remains available for other uses, with minimal impact on its operational readiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. While some ammunition has been supplied, the U.S. has increased its artillery shell production fivefold since before the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Potential Conflict with China
A potential conflict with China is anticipated to be primarily a naval engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Simultaneous Conflict Capability
The United States is considered capable of managing a land-based conflict in Western Eurasia (like supporting Ukraine) simultaneously with a naval conflict in the Eastern end (like against China) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This capability stems from the differing types of military supplies and assets required for each theater, which the U.S. can provide concurrently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. These operations involve radically different command structures and military assets that do not necessarily need to be in the same location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Current Assessment
> The United States is capable of conducting both a land war on the western end of Eurasia and a naval war on the eastern end simultaneously, utilizing distinct military assets and command structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

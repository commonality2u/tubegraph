The current state of Russian military operations and data suggests a significant problem with misinformation at the highest levels of the Russian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. It is believed that President Putin has been misled about the true status of the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Putin's Inner Circle and Sycophancy
Putin has surrounded himself with sycophants for some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. He reportedly communicates with only about six people, and only three of them are considered competent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The three less competent individuals are unfortunately in charge of the defense industry and military plans in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Key Figures and Their Influence

### Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu
Sergey Shoigu, the Defense Minister, is regarded as one of the most incompetent people in the Russian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. He oversees the broader battle plan and the entire defense industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

Investigations suggest that Shoigu has personally embezzled one-third of the Russian defense budget allocated for equipment manufacturing over recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. An additional one-third of that remaining budget was reportedly stolen by his subordinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This corruption is believed to be the primary reason for the Russian military's lack of sufficient equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>. Shoigu was also responsible for providing false assurances about the availability of weapons shipments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Dimitri Progason (Wagner Group Leader)
Another defense official, Dimitri Progason, who leads the Wagner group, rivals Shoigu in [[russian_military_incompetence | military incompetence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Progason's background is primarily as a caterer before he received government funding to establish Wagner as a mercenary group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Despite leading military operations, particularly in Bakhmut, he lacks direct experience in managing, leading, or participating in military operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

The sustained assault on Bakhmut has resulted in significant Russian casualties, with a conservative estimate of 20,000 deaths and 100,000 injuries, potentially much higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This single battle, which is not strategically significant, has severely depleted Russian forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Impact on Troop Numbers and Readiness
The best estimates suggest Russia has suffered at least 100,000 to 200,000 deaths since the operation began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Additionally, there are estimated to be at least 100,000 injured in Bakhmut alone, plus another 100,000 elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

Initial Russian forces in February 2022 numbered approximately 100,000 to 140,000 men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. A confirmed partial mobilization added another 300,000 troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. However, the total number of dead and injured potentially accounts for the entire mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. While a second partial mobilization of 200,000 to 250,000 troops is likely, these new recruits are less skilled and have primarily been used for tasks like building anti-tank fortifications rather than combat training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

The widespread lying to the Russian government about the true status of the war contributes to the "fog of war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

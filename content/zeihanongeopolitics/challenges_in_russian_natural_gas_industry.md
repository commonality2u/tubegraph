Gazprom, Russia's state natural gas monopoly, has reported its lowest full-year output levels since 1978 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This significant decline is primarily due to [[european_sanctions_on_russian_natural_gas | European efforts to cut their dependence on Russian natural gas to zero]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The sanctions related to natural gas have been particularly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Nature of Natural Gas Transportation

Natural gas requires a specialized system for production, transport, and export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Any disruption in this system, whether due to issues with insurance, pipes, pumps, or legalities, can halt the entire operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Crucially, natural gas cannot be easily redirected once infrastructure is in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Impact of Reduced European Demand

Most of Russia's natural gas historically supplied to Europe comes from the Urengoy area, a field that has been in production for half a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This gas travels thousands of miles through pipelines via Ukraine and Belarus into various European nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. When European countries stopped accepting deliveries, Russia was forced to gradually shut down operations in these fields because the gas could not be rerouted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

Russian natural gas exports to Europe have plummeted by 85% since the start of the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Only a small amount continues to flow to the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary, who currently lack immediate [[alternatives_to_russian_natural_gas_for_europe | alternatives to Russian natural gas supplies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. These three nations have also been the most resistant to broader sanctions regimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. However, Europe is actively building interconnections to further reduce its dependence on Russian natural gas for good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Challenges with Other Gas Facilities

While some Russian natural gas still flows from Eastern Siberia to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities like Sakhalin Island (supplying Japan) and Yamal Peninsula (previously shipping to Europe) are still operational, these are also expected to face challenges in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

The Yamal LNG, Sakhalin LNG, and the Kovykta field (near Lake Baikal) are all much more technically complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The initial development and construction of these facilities were primarily undertaken by foreign companies, with BP being a major player, and Japanese companies Mitsui and Mitsubishi, along with ExxonMobil, involved in Sakhalin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Most of these foreign companies have since withdrawn from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, leaving Russia without the necessary technical skills to maintain these complex projects [[longterm_prospects_of_russian_natural_gas_production | in the long term]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Long-Term Recovery Prospects

The prospect of Russia's natural gas industry recovering to previous levels is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Decline in Technical Expertise
Russia once excelled in ice and tundra production during the Soviet era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. However, the Soviet industrial educational system collapsed around 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, coinciding with a collapse in the [[demographic_challenges_facing_russia | Russian birth rate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This has resulted in significantly fewer people who can be trained in petroleum engineering and reservoir management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. The youngest individuals with comprehensive experience in these fields are now in their early 60s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. For the past two decades, much of the significant maintenance and recovery rate improvements in mature zones like Urengoy were performed by foreign companies, including BP, ExxonMobil, Germans, and the Dutch, all of whom are now gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Inapplicability of Modern Technologies
While Urengoy is a mature production zone that could theoretically benefit from mass application of Shale Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, these technologies are unsuitable for the region. Shale operations require significant labor and proximity to population centers, and they are not effective in areas that freeze solid due to the need for large amounts of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Urengoy is located far from major population centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, meaning it will likely never be brought back to significant production because Russia lacks the capabilities, and the appropriate technologies are geographically incompatible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Unprecedented Market Shift
The rapid withdrawal of Russia, once the world's largest producer and exporter of natural gas, from global markets in less than four years, is unprecedented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Despite this, the price shocks felt by Europeans have been relatively mild, largely due to their success in importing liquefied natural gas from other suppliers, particularly the Persian Gulf and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This has placed price pressure on other regions that previously relied on these suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. The European sanctions regime has been surprisingly effective in cutting Russian income without unduly disrupting their own systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

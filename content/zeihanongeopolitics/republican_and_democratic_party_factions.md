The United States electoral system, characterized by a "first-past-the-post single-member district system," encourages the formation of two dominant, "big tent" political parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This system, where voters choose one person representing a specific geographic area rather than a party, incentivizes parties to gain marginal votes to outnumber opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Consequently, third or fourth parties rarely last more than one or two political cycles before the system reverts to two main parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This structure significantly influences the [[us_electoral_system_and_its_effect_on_political_parties | US electoral system and its effect on political parties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Factional Dynamics within Parties

Within these "big tent" parties, numerous power centers and factions exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. These factions' political power fluctuates as technology, geopolitics, and social issues evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The last 30 years have seen significant changes, including hyper-globalization followed by de-globalization, the rise of the information economy and social media, and the mass retirement of Baby Boomers, all contributing to a period of [[political_volatility_and_realignment_in_the_united_states | political volatility and realignment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Understanding the relationships between these factions within their respective parties is crucial during such transitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Republican Party Coalition

Historically, the Republican Party has operated with a numerical disadvantage, possessing fewer voters and distinct factions compared to Democrats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Key factions include pro-lifers, military voters, law and order voters, and business voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

A strength of the Republican coalition has been that the issues typically do not clash among these factions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. For example, pro-lifers generally do not concern themselves with business regulation, and the business community does not typically focus on military policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This creates a smaller but very solid and reliable coalition, with consistent voter turnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Under normal circumstances, this cohesion provides Republicans with an advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Democratic Party Coalition

The Democratic Party typically casts a very wide net, forming a broad three-part coalition:
*   Minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>
*   Coastal, highly educated elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>
*   Organized labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>

The primary [[challenges_in_building_political_party_coalition_consensus | challenge in building political party coalition consensus]] for Democrats arises when discussing specific policies, as it is difficult to find issues that all three factions agree upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Examples of Internal Conflicts
*   **Social Issues:** Efforts by coastal educated elites to address racism, such as coining terms like "LatinX," can alienate minority groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. For instance, approximately 97% of Hispanics find "LatinX" either pointless or offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Environmental Policy:** The "Green Revolution" is strongly supported by coastal educated elites but often opposed by unions, as many green jobs are not unionized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

When Democratic candidates like Michael Dukakis or Hillary Clinton run on specific issues or make practical pledges, it can trigger internal conflicts, leading to segments of the Democratic electorate not showing up to vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. To win, Democrats often need a charismatic candidate who does not extensively discuss specific policies, a characteristic that contributed to Barack Obama's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## The [[impact_of_donald_trump_on_the_republican_coalition | Impact of Donald Trump]]

Donald Trump has significantly altered the political landscape by introducing a number of wedge issues not only across society but also within the Republican electorate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This has created internal divisions within the party.

### Examples of New Divisions
*   **Military and Abortion Policies:** Actions like Tommy Tuberville's months-long blocking of military promotions over abortion policy created conflict between military voters and abortion voters, two factions that previously had no major disagreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Alienation of the Business Community:** Donald Trump's preference for adoration and dislike of dissent has alienated the business community from the social conservative voters within the Republican coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

This environment forces Republicans to face a "democratic-style cohesion test," despite having fewer voters than Democrats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. If Donald Trump were the candidate, the Republican Party would likely not see its entire coalition turn out, making it numerically difficult for him to win the general election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, even before considering the [[role_of_independents_in_us_politics | role of independents in US politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

Recent events, particularly the destruction of Russian arm depots hundreds of miles from the border, suggest a significant [[shift_in_ukraine_war_dynamics | change in the tempo of the War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The three targeted locations include Kodor, Tow Rope, and Tick Hor Retes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. One explosion was so large, described as kiloton range, that it was detected by seismic monitoring stations a thousand miles away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Contributing Factors to New Ukrainian Tactics

Several factors contribute to these evolving [[Ukrainian military strategy and offensive preparations | Ukrainian military strategy and offensive preparations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>:

### New Weapon System: Lenisa Drone Missile

Ukraine has introduced a new weapon system called "Lenisa" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This "drone missile" is slightly less capable than a cruise missile, with a range of no more than 300 miles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. However, unlike traditional drones, it flies much faster, making it harder to intercept, and can carry a significantly heavier payloadâ€”two to five times larger than the 75-pound warheads of Ukraine's previous drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. These new missiles are being deployed in large numbers; for instance, at least 100 were reportedly used in the attack on Toit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Enhanced Intelligence on Russian Rail Movements

Russian cargo movement, especially for distances beyond the "final mile," predominantly relies on rail due to the low value of agricultural land preventing the development of extensive road networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This reliance makes the rail system a significant vulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

The attack on Tiaret (likely Tick Hor Retes) reportedly hit an ammunition train that was unloading at the time, resulting in the destruction of the entire depot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This incident suggests that Ukraine may have found a way to track Russian rail movements in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. The capture of the rail depot at Suda in the Kursk Province weeks prior could be providing Ukraine with the ability to tap into or hack the Russian rail network, giving them access to schedules and locations of locomotives and their cargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This intelligence provides a "target-rich environment" for [[ukrainian_military_strategy_and_territorial_gains | Ukrainian military strategy and territorial gains]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Shifting Target Priorities

With improved intelligence on the rail system and the availability of faster, more lethal, mass-produced missile drones, Ukraine's logical next target is the Russian power generation and distribution system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Approximately two-thirds of Russia's locomotives are electric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Disrupting the electricity system would cripple the entire Russian transport network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

Early signs of this shift may have been observed with limited drone attacks on power centers in Crimea, possibly as a test run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Greater activity is expected within 150 miles of the Ukrainian border to the north, northeast, and east, targeting Russian transport networks and ammunition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Impact on Russian Operations

These [[ukrainian_tactics_against_russian_air_defense_systems | Ukrainian tactics against Russian air defense systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a> are already impacting Russian operations. Russian counteroffensives in places like Kursk have reportedly petered out, and assaults on areas like the Donbas, specifically towards the Ukrainian rail network at Barov, have stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. If Russia had captured Barov, it would have hobbled Ukraine's ability to move forces along the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

The effectiveness of these attacks is detrimental to Russia in the short, medium, and long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Russia's military strategy relies on overwhelming numerical superiority in personnel and shells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. This approach is unsustainable without a robust rail network to supply the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Ukraine's ability to target the heart of this network marks a significant development in the [[Ukraine war and military innovation | Ukraine war and military innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

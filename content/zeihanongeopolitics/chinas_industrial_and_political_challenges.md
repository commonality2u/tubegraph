China faces significant industrial and political challenges, primarily stemming from its rapidly deteriorating demographics. New data from the UN, based on Chinese figures, indicates a severe and worsening demographic situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Industrial Challenges

### Demographic Impact on Workforce
China is experiencing the fastest aging workforce globally, and arguably in human history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The number of new workers entering the labor force is significantly smaller than those retiring, leading to a massive increase in labor costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Chinese labor costs have risen at the fastest pace of any country in any era, including during the Black Death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Since 2000, labor costs have increased by approximately a factor of 15, while the Chinese economy has only expanded by a factor of roughly 3.5 to 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

This makes China's current industrial power largely due to the "sunk cost of the industrial plant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Industries that have relocated from China often find shorter, simpler supply chains and fewer political complications elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Collapsing Birth Rates
Official data reveals a collapse in the number of children under age five, with roughly twice as many people aged 15 as there are under five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Before COVID-19, around 2017, China saw a sudden 40% collapse in the birth rate over five years among the ethnic Han population, and over 50% among many minority groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Anecdotal evidence suggests the birth rate dropped even further during COVID-19, which also likely increased the death rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Data Inaccuracy and Demographic Collapse
The Shanghai Academy of Sciences suggests China has overcounted its population under age 45 by over 100 million people due to the one-child policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This implies that China passed the point of demographic no return over 20 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. It is estimated that India surpassed China in population about a decade ago, and the average Chinese person became older than the average American around 2007 or 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This indicates China is in the "advanced stages of demographic collapse," not merely decay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

This [[demographic_and_economic_challenges_facing_china | demographic and economic challenges facing China]] implies that the current decade will be the last in which China can function as a modern industrialized nation-state, as it will simply lack the necessary population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Political Challenges

Companies operating in China are increasingly aware of the political system's complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Key political challenges include:

*   **Data Access Restrictions**: It is becoming illegal for foreigners to access data that is publicly available in most other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Operating Environment and Geopolitical Risk**: Beyond demographics and labor costs, businesses must contend with the operating environment, energy access issues, geopolitical risks, and regulatory risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

For businesses, the labor force will not recover, current labor costs are as low as they will ever be, and consumption is at its peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Considering these [[chinas_economic_strategies_and_challenges | economic challenges]], the "sunk cost of industrial plant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a> becomes less relevant with each passing year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is a major international lender that assists countries in economic difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. They are considered highly proficient in economic forecasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Their most recent forecast, released in early 2023, is noted as the least optimistic in 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Key Projections
The IMF projects global economic growth to be 2.8% for the next year and an average of 3% for the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This forecast is considered potentially "significantly over optimistic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, indicating a challenging outlook for [[future_prospects_for_global_economic_systems | global economic systems]].

## Factors Influencing the Forecast

The pessimistic outlook is attributed to several secular trends impacting different economic blocs:

### Developed World (Rich World)
Economic activity in the developed world is largely driven by private consumption, such as credit card spending, housing purchases, and raising families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. However, this region is facing significant demographic challenges:
*   **Declining Birth Rates** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>: Mass urbanization, beginning around 1940-1950, has led to persistently lower birth rates across the rich world, with no exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Most advanced countries dropped below the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman over 50 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Aging Workforce** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>: The rich world is now experiencing a shortage of working-aged adults, as the Baby Boomers, the last large generation, began entering retirement in the last calendar year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Shift in Consumption** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>: With fewer children, spending shifts from items like diapers to personal goods such as cars and condos, which has less "octane" for economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This means countries like those in Europe will not return to the consumption-led growth seen in the 1990s and 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Secularly lower growth rates are expected to be the norm for the rich world for at least the next 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This is a key aspect of [[global_demographic_shifts_and_future_economic_implications | global demographic shifts]] and their economic implications, particularly for [[european_demographic_trends_and_economic_impacts | European demographic trends]].

### Developing World
The developing world requires significant [[capital_and_economic_growth_in_developing_countries | capital and economic growth in developing countries]] to develop infrastructure and consumer markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   **Capital Shortage** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>: Historically, this capital came from the rich world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. However, this money is no longer available as the rich world needs it to fund pensions and healthcare for its growing retired population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Secular Stagnation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>: Without this crucial input, the developing world is expected to face secular stagnation until capital can be generated internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### China
Despite historically sustaining growth rates above global averages (often above 8% for 40 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, China's growth is projected to decline to around 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. China faces a unique combination of challenges:
*   **Demographic Decline** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>: China is experiencing a "demographic bomb," with a much steeper decline in its workforce than any other country. It is expected to "get old before it gets rich" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This hinders consumption-led growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure Saturation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>: Like Japan in the 1990s and 2000s, China has already developed extensive infrastructure. Building more does not yield significant additional economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Mounting Debt** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>: Decades of infrastructure spending have resulted in a national debt load of approximately 300-350% of GDP, which is unsustainable long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Loss of U.S. Sponsorship** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>: A key factor in China's past success was de facto American sponsorship, providing risk-free, secure, and cheap access to global energy, commodity, and consumer markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This is no longer available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## The Unwinding of Globalization
The overall forecast reflects the unwinding of the globalized world, influenced by both geographic and demographic factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This will lead to generally lower growth rates globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

> [!INFO] **Localized Growth Areas**
> While global growth will be low, some regions may see an uptick. Countries are engaging in "nearshoring," "reshoring," and "friendshoring" to bring manufacturing capacity for critical materials and technologies back home, reducing vulnerability to geopolitical risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This localized manufacturing, while not global, will create growth stories in specific places like Mexico, the United States, and Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Conversely, countries like China, Korea, and Germany may experience declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This illustrates a [[potential_global_economic_impact_and_the_future_of_international_currency | potential global economic impact]] of shifting supply chains.

The ongoing conflict in Ukraine is significantly shaping the second phase of the "Revolution in Military Affairs" (RMA), demonstrating the democratization of advanced military technologies [00:01:17].

## First Phase of RMA (1990s-2000s)

The initial phase of the Revolution in Military Affairs occurred in the 1990s and 2000s [00:00:20]. During this period, the United States integrated information technologies with its military capabilities [00:00:22]. This involved combining sensors and targeting information, whether delivered via the ordinance itself, satellite, or attached to the weapon [00:00:28]. Examples include Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) and Tomahawk cruise missiles [00:00:39].

This integration allowed for the delivery of explosive ordinance with a very high degree of accuracy [00:00:50]. Instead of widespread "carpet bombing" as seen in previous conflicts like Vietnam, one or two weapons could precisely hit a specific target [00:00:55]. While there was speculation that marrying precision weapons with hypersonics would eliminate all rules of warfare, this proved incorrect due to factors like jamming and the sheer scale of targets, as hypersonics were too expensive for mass application [00:01:07].

## Second Phase of RMA: Democratization of Technology

The current second phase of the RMA involves the "democratization of the application of these technologies" [00:01:38]. Rather than control being centralized at high command levels, individual soldiers are now gaining command of information and can make autonomous targeting decisions [00:01:48]. This phenomenon is most aggressively observed in Ukraine [00:01:55].

### Ukrainian Drone Strategies

[[ukrainian_drone_missile_innovations | Ukrainian drone missile innovations]] are following a four-part strategy that is expected to evolve [00:02:00].

1.  **Naval Warfare:**
    *   Ukraine is employing drone technologies attached to jet skis, loaded with hundreds of pounds of explosives, to target [[Russian military strategies and advancements in Ukraine | Russian naval vessels]] [00:02:08].
    *   This tactic has been so effective that the Western half of the Black Sea is now a "no-go" zone for the [[Russian military strategies and advancements in Ukraine | Russian Fleet]] [00:02:19].
    *   Larger [[Russian military strategies and advancements in Ukraine | Russian ships]] are often unable to shoot back because their deck-mounted weapons are designed to hit targets at or above the horizon and cannot angle down to engage small boats [00:02:31].

2.  **Anti-Personnel Drones:**
    *   Due to issues with conventional aid from the American Congress, Ukrainians have had to find ways to hold the line against the [[Russian military strategies and advancements in Ukraine | Russians]] when artillery shells are scarce [00:02:49].
    *   They have mass-produced very small drones with payloads of about one pound, similar to a small grenade [00:03:00].
    *   These drones are used in swarms against [[Russian military strategies and advancements in Ukraine | Russian human wave tactics]], effectively dropping grenades at range into massed infantry [00:03:08].
    *   In the Battle of Avdiivka, despite technically losing, Ukrainians regularly inflicted 8:1 to 10:1 casualty ratios on the [[Russian military strategies and advancements in Ukraine | Russians]] without significant artillery support [00:03:19].

3.  **Mid-Range Infrastructure Strikes:**
    *   Ukraine has developed the Sye and Beaver drones for mid-range infrastructure strikes [00:03:37].
    *   The Beaver is more technologically advanced with longer range and better avionics, while the Scythe is a more rudimentary "garage project" made partly of plywood, carrying a decent warhead but with less range [00:03:43].
    *   These drones target infrastructure within a few hundred kilometers of the front line, including refineries and fuel depots in [[Russian military strategies and advancements in Ukraine | Russian territory]] [00:03:59].

4.  **Deep Russian Interior Strikes (Phoenix Ghost):**
    *   The United States is involved with the Phoenix Ghost drone, which carries a small warhead (5 to 15 lbs) [00:04:16].
    *   Its modular design allows it to be assembled on the fly and is light enough for a single soldier to carry [00:04:27].
    *   Initially used against armored vehicles and supply trucks, Ukrainians quickly realized its potential for accurate, deep strikes [00:04:35].
    *   Phoenix Ghost drones provide a live visual feed to the controller, enabling precision targeting [00:04:46].
    *   [[ukrainian_drone_missile_innovations | Ukrainian Special Forces]] are likely using these American-made drones deep within the [[Russian military strategies and advancements in Ukraine | Russian interior]] to conduct refinery attacks [00:05:05].
    *   These attacks have taken offline a significant portion of [[Russian military strategies and advancements in Ukraine | Russian refining capacity]], ranging from half a million to a million barrels per day [00:05:22].
    *   The drones' accuracy allows operators to target sensitive refinery components, like distillation towers, leading to significant damage [00:05:29].
    *   Repairing this damage is difficult for [[Russian military strategies and advancements in Ukraine | Russia]] due to a lack of trained engineers [00:05:48].
    *   The disruption of refining capacity impacts a significant portion of [[Russian military strategies and advancements in Ukraine | Russian government revenues]] (around 8%) [00:05:57]. It also creates pressure on the crude oil pipeline system, potentially forcing production shut-ins that [[Russian military strategies and advancements in Ukraine | Russia]] may not have the engineers to restart [00:06:13].

### Implications

This new phase of warfare combines strategic, naval, infantry, and economic warfare in ways that seemed impossible just a few months prior [00:06:33]. Many of these advanced drones are 100% Ukrainian-made [00:06:44].

This situation evokes parallels to the American Civil War and the Crimean campaign of the 1850s, where early industrial warfare was observed [00:06:52]. Many countries are now sending observers to Ukraine, regardless of aid provided, because it represents a fundamentally new technological breakthrough in warfare [00:07:16]. The first phase of the RMA transformed the US Cold War defense industry into a force with extreme range and precision [00:07:32]. The current phase maintains that precision while marrying it to individual decision-making, deploying not hundreds but tens of thousands of decentralized weapon platforms [00:07:42]. The ability for individuals to target enemy formations at scale across a thousand-mile front and hundreds of miles behind it is unprecedented in history [00:08:02].

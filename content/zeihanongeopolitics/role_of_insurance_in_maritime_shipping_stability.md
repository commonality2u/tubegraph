The global maritime shipping system, despite numerous recent disruptions, has not yet experienced a "meaningful break" in its operational structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. A significant factor contributing to this stability is the existing insurance framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

## Traditional Insurance Structure

Every vessel operating globally is required to obtain insurance policies that cover both its hull and its cargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. Historically, American and European entities have been the primary providers of this insurance for most shipping vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

## Impact of Sanctions and the Dual System

Despite tightening sanctions against Russia due to the Ukraine war, the fundamental insurance system has not been entirely broken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. While traditional insurers have largely denied coverage to Russian shipping, Indian, Chinese, and Russian state companies have stepped in to offer policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

This has led to the development of a "dual system" in maritime shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>:
*   **Normal World:** Shipping insured primarily by American and European companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
*   **[[the_emergence_of_a_shadow_fleet_in_maritime_shipping | Ghost Fleet]]:** An [[the_emergence_of_a_shadow_fleet_in_maritime_shipping | alternative fleet]] composed mainly of older vessels that were near decommissioning, brought back into service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. These vessels, particularly liquid cargo haulers, operate with Chinese, Indian, or Russian insurance policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. This [[the_emergence_of_a_shadow_fleet_in_maritime_shipping | ghost fleet]] may account for as much as 10% of the global tanker fleet, with some bulkers and container ships also joining its ranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

## The [[the_emergence_of_a_shadow_fleet_in_maritime_shipping | Shadow Fleet]] as a Buffer

The existence of this [[the_emergence_of_a_shadow_fleet_in_maritime_shipping | shadow fleet]] has effectively deferred and absorbed risk within the global shipping system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. It acts as a buffer, allowing the system to continue functioning despite [[challenges_in_global_maritime_shipping | disruptions]] such as:
*   Ukrainian attacks on Russian energy facilities on the Baltic and Black Seas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.
*   A drought in Panama significantly reducing Panama Canal throughput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.
*   Houthi attacks in Yemen, impacting Red Sea shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.
*   Resurgence of piracy in Somalia, the Gulf of Guinea, and the Strait of Malacca <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
*   Increased Chinese assertive actions in their regional waters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.
*   Russia making a significant portion of the Black Sea a no-go zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

This [[the_emergence_of_a_shadow_fleet_in_maritime_shipping | ghost fleet]] is largely undocumented and operates "under the table" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

## Unstable Equilibrium and Future Outlook

This current state of stability, maintained by the [[the_emergence_of_a_shadow_fleet_in_maritime_shipping | ghost fleet]], is described as an "unstable sort of equilibrium" in early 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. The system's resilience relies on the fact that no major country has yet deliberately targeted another country's commercial shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. The [[us_navys_role_in_global_protection | U.S. Navy]] continues to patrol oceans where possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>, a system that largely benefits China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

However, the future is uncertain. If a [[the_emergence_of_a_shadow_fleet_in_maritime_shipping | ghost fleet]] ship encounters trouble, or if a major country begins targeting another's shipping, the buffer provided by this dual system will be lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. This could lead to a rapid breakdown of global shipping, much faster than it would otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

The two biggest beneficiaries of the current long-range shipping system, which traverse dangerous zones, are Russian sanctions-busting oil exports and Chinese merchandise exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. When the system cracks, these will be the first to be severely impacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. The potential disruption of global shipping, especially given that East Asia houses half of all manufacturing supply chain steps, necessitates a shift towards a more regional trade model in the not-too-distant future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.

China is the world's largest importer of various essential commodities, including energy, foodstuffs, and the materials required for food production, as well as nearly every mineral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Very few raw materials are produced domestically within China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Instead, raw materials are largely imported, processed, converted into value-added manufactured goods, and then exported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This model makes China highly vulnerable to disruptions at all stages of the production chain across every industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Stockpiling Efforts and Challenges

While China has been stockpiling various resources like foods, fuels, and materials, particularly in preparation for a potential protracted conflict with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, these efforts face significant limitations.

### Energy Storage
China aims to achieve 120 days of import cover for oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. However, unlike the United States, China lacks extensive salt domes for underground storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Consequently, much of its storage must be above ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, making these facilities vulnerable to missile attacks and potentially eradicating stockpiles within days during a hot conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

China's energy imports are also vulnerable to disruptions by United States sea power, not only near the Chinese coast but anywhere along global shipping lanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The Strait of Malacca is a particularly sensitive choke point, as approximately 80% of China's oil imports transit through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Food Storage
Similar challenges plague food stockpiling efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. China previously attempted to build a massive corn storage facility, which consisted merely of large piles of corn along the roadside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. These piles rotted within a year, rendering the effort useless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This highlights the practical difficulties in maintaining large-scale, long-term food reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## [[chinas_economic_dependency_on_exports | Dependence of China's Economy on Exports]] and Flawed Assumptions

Even if China were able to effectively store energy, food, and material inputs, its economy remains dependent on exports to pay for these essential imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The United States is China's primary customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

The Chinese military strategy, as perceived, rests on the flawed assumption that in a conflict, the United States Navy would operate close to the Chinese coast, allowing China's Air Force to target them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Simultaneously, it assumes the United States would continue to patrol global oceans to facilitate China's import of food and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a> and keep its market open for Chinese exports to enable payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This strategy is considered fundamentally flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

Recent events highlight a new phase of uncoordinated, yet deliberate, actions by Russia and China, prompting responses and observations from NATO countries. These incidents are described as "less than War scenarios" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Incidents Against Finland

Two significant events have occurred against Finland:
*   **Migrant Funneling** Russia began funneling illegal migrants from Central and South Asia into the Finnish border. This surge, from less than one person a day to almost a thousand, indicates it was intentional and premeditated, especially since it occurred in an area Russia considers a security zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   **Cable and Pipeline Damage** A Chinese container ship, the "New Polar Bear," dropped its anchor in the Gulf of Finland between Finland and Estonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The vessel then dragged the anchor for approximately 20 miles along the seabed, severing a telecommunications cable and damaging an electricity transmission cable and pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This incident is not considered accidental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, and the anchor has been found and matched to the vessel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Both Finland and Estonia are certain about what transpired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

In both cases, Russia and China adopted an attitude of "what are you going to do about it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Strategic Implications and Cooperation

These actions serve as a form of practice for [[cooperation_between_russia_and_china | Russia and China]], who have not previously engaged in functional cooperation or coordination of their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. By undertaking two distinct operations in different theaters against Finland—a country that recently displeased Russia by joining NATO—they are practicing for larger-scale coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This strategy aims to force the United States to divide its attention across two directions simultaneously, which is considered a strategic win for Russia and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## NATO's Immediate Response

[[potential_nato_implications_in_response_to_nuclear_threats | NATO countries]] have already begun adjusting their Naval Patrol patterns to monitor for such incidents, particularly in response to actions like the Chinese anchor dragging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Finland's Role in NATO

Finland, formerly a neutral country due to its apprehension of the Soviet Union and then Russia, has now joined NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Historically, Finland's military is recognized for its effectiveness, arguably possessing the most effective military per capita within NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Finnish forces are now training with NATO members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

Finland also maintains strong alliances within the region:
*   Its "little brothers": Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>
*   Other Scandinavian nations: Denmark, Sweden, and Norway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>
*   Strong relations with the United Kingdom and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>

Russia's decision to target Finland, believing it to be isolated, reflects a breakdown in [[strategic_and_diplomatic_implications_for_russia | Russian decision-making]] at the diplomatic and security levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Even Stalin had some apprehension regarding the Finns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

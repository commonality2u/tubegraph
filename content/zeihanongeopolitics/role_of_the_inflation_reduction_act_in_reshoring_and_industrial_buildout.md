The United States is currently undergoing its greatest [[reindustrialization_process_in_the_united_states | re-industrialization process]] in history, building out industrial infrastructure, factories, refineries, pipelines, and roads faster than during World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. A key factor driving this recent surge in industrial construction spending is the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

## Context Leading to the IRA
Prior to the IRA, significant industrial buildout was already underway due to several factors:
*   **Highly Skilled Labor Force** The United States possesses the world's most highly skilled labor force by a significant margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.
*   **Shale Revolution** The [[impact_of_the_shale_revolution_on_us_industry | Shale Revolution]] glutted the U.S. with natural gas, making it a net independent energy producer and encouraging significant investment in chemicals and petrochemicals, which are precursor materials for most other manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
*   **COVID-19 Pandemic** During [[effects_of_covid_on_us_supply_chains_and_manufacturing | COVID-19]], it was discovered that international supply chains were not as reliable as previously thought, especially due to China's centrality in manufacturing and its COVID-19 lockdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. This prompted an immediate need for the U.S. to build domestically, leading to a doubling of total industrial construction spending above the 50-year average during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

## The Inflation Reduction Act's Contribution
Passed by the Biden Administration, the Inflation Reduction Act's primary impact is not on inflation, but rather on industrial buildout and [[deglobalization_and_its_impact_on_american_industry | reshoring]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.
*   **Investment in System Transformation** The IRA allocates roughly a trillion dollars into the system to build out the necessary infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. This includes transforming the power system and reshoring the production of everything within that power system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.
*   **Doubling Construction Spending** The IRA's incentives have caused construction spending to double again, building upon the already record levels seen three years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

## Long-Term Outlook
While this massive industrial expansion may lead to some short to midterm inflation, the long-term benefits are substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. The buildout aims to create a supply chain system that is:
*   Local <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>
*   Employs local labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>
*   Serves local customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>
*   Uses less energy and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>
*   Has fewer steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>
*   Largely immune to international shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>

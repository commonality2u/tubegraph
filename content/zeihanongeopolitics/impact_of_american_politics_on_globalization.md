Peter Zeihan explains why he believes [[deglobalization_and_its_impact_on_american_industry | deglobalization]] has passed the point of no return, even though the United States has benefited from globalization for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This conviction stems from three primary factors: the original security-driven motivation for globalization, the current [[influence_of_global_dynamics_on_us_policy_priorities | shifting global dynamics]], and significant changes in American domestic politics and demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Historical Context: Globalization as a Security Strategy

For the United States, globalization was primarily a security strategy, not an economic one in the traditional sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The U.S. economy was already the world's largest before World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Following the war, with potential rivals, allies, and enemies combined having an economy roughly the same size as the U.S., economic growth and security were challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Competition over resources, land, and security historically led to conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

Facing the Soviet Union in Europe, the U.S. recognized it could not economically or politically sustain a distant conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The solution was to "bribe everybody" by using the U.S. Navy to patrol global oceans, allowing allies universal access to materials and, crucially, to the American market—the only major market to survive the war intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. In return, these nations had to allow the U.S. to dictate their security policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This strategy successfully ended the Cold War, as the Soviet system could not compete with the economic alliance created by the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Shifting Global Dynamics

Over the past 30-35 years, the global landscape has changed significantly with the rise of hyper-globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Many more players, including Southeast Asia, Brazil, India, Russia, and China, have joined the global system under U.S.-established rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The U.S. economy is no longer as large as all other economies combined; the rest of the world is now three or four times its size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This makes the indirect economic subsidization previously provided by the U.S. untenable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

Furthermore, some countries, particularly China, are now so dependent on globalization that their survival would require increased U.S. support, not decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. China's demographics mean it lacks a domestic market, its military reach prevents it from securing energy, and its reliance on Russia leaves it vulnerable to geopolitical concessions through raw material supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. From the U.S. perspective, globalization no longer offers the same benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## American Political Shifts

American foreign policy reflects its domestic policy, and every generation or two, the U.S. undergoes a redefinition of its political parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. During the Cold War, the U.S. had a strong bipartisan foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. However, the last 35 years have seen:
*   The end of the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   The rise and fall of hyper-globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   The aging and retirement of the Baby Boomers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   The information revolution and social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

These shifts have changed how U.S. politics operates, causing factions within the major parties to realign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. This has directly impacted support for globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>:
*   **Unions**: Unions have largely moved away from the Democratic coalition, many siding with the anti-free trade stance of the Trump coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Business Community & National Security Conservatives**: These factions, previously strong proponents of globalization for economic and security reasons, were alienated from the Republican coalition during the Trump administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

Currently, the Biden administration and the Trump-led Republican coalition are competing for union support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This political dynamic means that no one in Washington is willing to discuss globalization positively, as the unions' political alignment is at stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. The groups that historically favored globalization are no longer influential in the current political discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This contributes to the [[shifts_in_us_foreign_policy_and_its_implications | shifts in US foreign policy and its implications]] and the [[political_dynamics_and_al liances_in_the_united_states_and_its_implications | political dynamics and alliances in the United States and its implications]].

## Demographic Impact

The most significant long-term factor is demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Urbanization and industrialization, which began in the rich world 75 years ago and in the developing world 40 years ago, lead to smaller family sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Children transition from being free labor on farms to expensive dependents in urban environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

Consequently, the world is running out of young people, particularly those under 20, and increasingly, those under 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. The core premise of trade and globalization is consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Without sufficient numbers of consumers—traditionally people aged 45 and under who are starting families and buying homes and cars—the system cannot be sustained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

Many nations are aging rapidly, including China and Russia (fastest in human history), Germany, Korea, Indonesia, India, and Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. By 2040-2045, the average American will be younger than the average Brazilian, and ten years later, younger than the average Indian, Indonesian, or Mexican <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

## Current US Policy Stance and Future Outlook

The combination of shifting security parameters, a declining economic basis for trade due to demographics, and a political moment focused on domestic issues means the U.S. is not interested in sustaining the globalized system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

Even a significant global security scare, such as the Ukraine war, is unlikely to reverse this trend. The Biden administration's current deals are focused on security, not "guns for butter" trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. In fact, the Biden administration has largely doubled down on the tariffs and trade wars initiated by the Trump administration, with only one exception (an aerospace deal with Europeans) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Policy Continuity
> The Biden administration is described as "far more [[deglobalization_and_its_impact_on_american_industry | anti-globalization]] than the Trump Administration was or at a minimum it's actually putting into the long-term policy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

This hardening of [[historical_context_of_american_globalization_policies | anti-globalization]] sentiment into American policy means that even if a future president were a strong globalist, they would face years of work to unwind the current policy direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Coupled with eight years of "complete strategic apathy" under the Obama administration, a return to a globalized system would take at least six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. By then, other major players like China will have undergone significant changes, further reinforcing the idea that the globalized system is unlikely to be revived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. These factors contribute to the overall [[challenges_facing_globalization | challenges facing globalization]] and the [[impact_of_us_withdrawal_on_global_trade | impact of US withdrawal on global trade]].

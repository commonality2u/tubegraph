Twitter, historically, offered significant opportunities for interactivity and engagement, which allowed users to gather information and connect directly with sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:05">[02:04:05]</a>. This dynamic has reportedly undergone substantial changes under new management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:30">[02:30:30]</a>.

## Historical Utility of Interaction

In its earlier form, Twitter was a valuable tool for gaining access to firsthand information from areas where mainstream media might not have a presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. For example, during the Ukraine War, individuals with personal contacts in the region could provide direct information, serving as a critical source, albeit one requiring vetting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.

The platform's accessibility meant that people providing this information were reachable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:05">[02:04:05]</a>. For users with a large following, asking questions often garnered attention from these sources, facilitating a form of "free information gathering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:17">[02:16:17]</a>. This interactivity allowed for engagement in conversations with potential sources and other viewers, generating ideas for content, such as videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:19">[02:19:19]</a>.

## Decline in Engagement

The nature of interactivity on Twitter has significantly deteriorated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:30">[02:30:30]</a>. The "For You" content category, which once featured interactions, has reportedly disappeared from user feeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:35">[02:33:35]</a>. Over a six-week period, one user reported only seven interactions with their audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>.

This decline is attributed to a shift in [[changes_in_twitters_content_moderation | content moderation]] policies under [[criticism_of_elon_musks_management_of_twitter | Elon Musk]], who, in a stated commitment to free speech, allegedly "destroyed all content moderation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:33">[01:33:33]</a>. This change reportedly led to an increase in spam and [[role_of_algorithms_and_fake_news | Bots]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>. While legitimate interactions have decreased, spam such as pornbots and crypto schemes can still easily penetrate the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:46">[02:46:46]</a>.

> "If you want to spam me with a pornbot that gets through and if you want to launch a crypto scheme and see if I'll fall for it that gets through and if it's a porn themed crypto scheme that absolutely gets through" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:46">[02:46:46]</a>

Consequently, what was once considered a rewarding aspect of a user's work has become a "time suck" and a "waste of everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:57">[02:57:57]</a>. This shift in the platform's utility is a primary [[reasons_for_leaving_twitter | reason for users to reconsider their engagement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. While the platform may still be used as a distribution channel for content, direct interaction has significantly diminished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:43">[03:43:43]</a>.

The Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, ticked up to 2.7% on April 26th, 2024, despite expectations for it to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This has caused concern among those on Wall Street who had anticipated numerous rate cuts to stimulate the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. However, the Federal Reserve does not seem interested in aligning with this expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## COVID-19 as a Primary Driver of Inflation

Most of the inflation experienced recently has been [[effects_of_covid_on_us_supply_chains_and_manufacturing | COVID-related]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Consumption Shifts**: Every time there was a shift in consumption patterns—due to openings, closings, new variants, or vaccines—what people consumed in terms of goods changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Supply Chain Retooling**: These changes in consumption patterns necessitated retooling supply chains to match new demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Adjustment Period**: On average, there is an 18 to 24-month adjustment period for supply chains to catch up to demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

Most of the United States reopened more than two years ago, with California, the last American state, reopening just under two years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This allowed inflation to steadily decrease as supply chains caught up, and the mismatch between goods and supply chains became a smaller factor in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Current State of Inflation and Future Outlook

While [[effects_of_covid_on_us_supply_chains_and_manufacturing | COVID-related]] adjustments brought inflation down from its peak of roughly 9% to closer to 3%, it has since leveled off around 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. It is unlikely to reach the Federal Reserve's preferred ceiling of 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. The current 3% rate is likely the "new normal" for inflation lows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

Unless the Federal Reserve's mandate changes, interest rates are not expected to drop below their current levels; they are more likely to increase over the next two to five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

Beyond [[effects_of_covid_on_us_supply_chains_and_manufacturing | COVID-19's immediate impact]], [[shifts_in_global_supply_chains_and_their_consequences | deglobalization]] is also contributing to inflationary pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. As the U.S. increasingly disentangles itself from global supply chains, there is a skyrocketing demand for American employment, capital, and materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Building new industrial plants and infrastructure in the U.S. is expensive, creating significant demand and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. This productive inflation is building the industrial plant needed for the next generation or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

Therefore, "higher for longer" interest rates might mean another decade before significant relief in capital costs is seen, until this new industrial plant is built out and another large capital-generating class (like Baby Boomers once were) enters their capital-rich period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

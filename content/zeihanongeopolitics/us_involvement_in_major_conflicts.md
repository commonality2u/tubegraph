The United States has not engaged in a "major conflict" on the scale of World War II since that conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Post-World War II engagements have primarily served different purposes:

*   **Supporting the Global Order** During the Cold War, conflicts like Korea and Vietnam were undertaken to support the global order and maintain alliances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Forging a New World** Following the Cold War, operations such as Desert Shield and Desert Storm aimed to establish a new world order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Conditions for Future US Engagement

For the US to be drawn into another major conflict of similar scale, two primary conditions would need to be met:

1.  **Political Leadership** The emergence of a US political leader who views international issues as a crucible for forging a new national identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Currently, there is no indication of such a leader on either side of the political spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
2.  **Direct Provocation** A truly "breathtakingly stupid and provoking" act directly targeting the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Historical examples include Pearl Harbor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, the Cuban Missile Crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, Sputnik <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, and the invasion of Kuwait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Potential Adversaries

*   **China** The Chinese leadership is considered too pragmatic to provoke the United States into a direct conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. They recognize that a naval conflict would cut off their crucial food and energy imports, leading to economic collapse and mass starvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Russia** Russia is the only country currently considered a potential issue due to "Russian incompetence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Russia's military is described as a "mob" rather than a classic army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. If the conflict in Ukraine were to directly threaten [[american_interests_and_responses | US interests]], particularly concerning NATO, it could lead to more direct US involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. However, despite Russian gains in the past year, the conflict would need to escalate significantly over several years to reach a point of direct US military engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Current US Military Posture
> The US military has "rested and recruited" since the War on Terror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. There are currently no major occupations or hot deployments, meaning the military is not heavily engaged from a combat perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## North American Considerations

While most conflicts involving the US occur outside North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, the only theoretical internal issue that could involve the US military is dealing with Mexican drug cartels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

*   **Mexican Cartel Situation** American demand for cocaine has severely undermined the rule of law in large parts of Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Combined with the "general incompetence" of the AMLO administration, Mexico's public safety, health, and infrastructure have deteriorated significantly in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Military Solution Feasibility** A unilateral US military solution to the cartel issue is considered unrealistic due to Mexico's vast size and the complexity of the cartel situation, which is far more intricate than conflicts in Pakistan or Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Any military involvement would require "hand in glove" cooperation with the Mexican administration, similar to US efforts in Colombia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Economic Impact** A unilateral US military intervention without Mexican participation would destroy the trade relationship, potentially leading to an economic depression in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. The US-Mexico relationship is critical for trade, human migration, manufacturing, and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

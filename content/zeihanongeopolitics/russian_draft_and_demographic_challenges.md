The ongoing conflict has significantly depleted Russia's military reserves, both in terms of equipment and manpower, leading to [[russian_military_challenges_and_recruitment_issues | recruitment issues]] and reliance on outdated materiel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Depletion of Military Equipment

At the end of March, Ukrainian forces "massacred" a unit of the 76th Guards Air Assault Group in Zerit Province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This elite unit, known for being among Russia's better troops and having the best pre-war equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, was observed fighting with T-55 tanks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

These T-55 tanks, built in the 1950s at the start of the Cold War, are considered outdated by over half a century by Russian standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. They are slower, have less range, feature thinner armor compared to modern tanks, and crucially, require a four-person crew instead of the standard three, making them more manpower-intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### State of Russia's Tank Reserves
At the beginning of the war, Russia possessed 12,000 tanks, with approximately 2,000 in active service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The presence of T-55s in elite units suggests that these initial 2,000 active tanks are now either incapacitated or destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

While Russia has deep reserves of an additional 10,000 tanks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, they are resorting to using the oldest models first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. T-55s predate modern optics, allowing for easier and quicker refurbishment by adding cheap aftermarket optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Newer tanks, such as T-72s, originally had optics, but after 30 years in storage, their seals and wiring are degraded, requiring more advanced and difficult replacement of existing components. This equipment for refurbishment is often no longer available to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

As a result, Russia's entire pre-war tank reserve is now exhausted, and any tanks deployed must undergo refurbishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Manpower Shortages and Demographic Challenges

The situation mirrors the challenges with military personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Estimates suggest between 550,000 and 750,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or incapacitated in the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This figure represents the entirety of Russia's pre-war army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

Consequently, Russia is forced to deploy newly drafted individuals to the front lines with minimal training, leading to problems with personnel inflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### The "Silent Draft"
Russia has maintained a "silent draft," unofficially conscripting between 15,000 and 45,000 people monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. While Russia has a large population base, this source of manpower is not limitless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### [[demographic_challenges_facing_russia | Demographic Challenges Facing Russia]]
At the war's outset, Russia had approximately 8 million men in their 20s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. With roughly 600,000 killed or incapacitated, and another million having fled the country, this number has dwindled to about 6.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

Considering the remaining tank reserves and available men in their 20s, Russia could potentially sustain the current pace of the war for another 5 to 8 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Beyond this period, they would face severe shortages of both equipment and manpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This points towards the "Twilight of the Russian system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Strategic Implications

Russia can no longer shuffle resources from other parts of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. The military is now entirely dependent on a continuous throughput for refurbishment, training, and external equipment supplies to sustain the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This means that economic and political factors, both within Russia and abroad, now critically impact the pipeline of men and equipment to the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

Russia currently lacks strategic depth; any new equipment or personnel are immediately sent to the front to prevent it from emptying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. While Russia has shown recent momentum, such as the breaking of the Avdiivka front, they have struggled to capitalize on these gains, and the front has become static again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Aggressive attacks, like those by the 76th Guards, result in heavy casualties that the Russian forces cannot sustain indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Despite these challenges, the conflict is still projected to continue for another 5 to 8 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

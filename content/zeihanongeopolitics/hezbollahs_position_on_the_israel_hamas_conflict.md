From: [[zeihanongeopolitics]] <br/> 

Hezbollah is identified as a Shiite Arab militia primarily operating out of Southern Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Historically, they have had numerous skirmishes with the [[political_dynamics_in_israel | Israelis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The group possesses a potent paramilitary force and a significant number of rockets, which they have, on occasion, launched onto [[political_dynamics_in_israel | Israeli]] cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Stance on the Current [[israel_and_hamas_conflict_overview | Hamas Isra fight]]

Despite a fiery speech from their leader, "ASA," encouraging "resistance" and "fighting the Jews," Hezbollah has opted to remain out of the immediate conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The group has "a lot to lose" by engaging in this particular conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Reasons for Non-Intervention

Several factors contribute to Hezbollah's decision to not directly join the conflict:
*   **Lack of Coordination** This is characterized as "clearly a [[hamas_attacks_on_israel | Hamas operation]]" for which Hamas had been preparing for some time, with no coordination whatsoever with Hezbollah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Unpreparedness** Hezbollah is not ready to move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Differing Objectives and Identity** Hezbollah has "different backers," a "different religion," and "different approaches" from Hamas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Political Gains** Over the last 50 years, Hezbollah has achieved many of its goals, including becoming part of the government in Beirut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This position grants them unprecedented influence, a "seat at the table," which they are unwilling to relinquish, especially as they were not the instigators of this conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Relationship with [[irans_approach_to_the_israel_hamas_situation | Iran]]

Hezbollah is sponsored by [[irans_approach_to_the_israel_hamas_situation | Iran]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Similar to Hezbollah's public rhetoric, [[irans_approach_to_the_israel_hamas_situation | Iran's]] supreme leader has also made strong verbal condemnations against the "occupation" and "Jews" but signaled an intent not to directly engage unless attacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. [[irans_approach_to_the_israel_hamas_situation | Iran]] has engaged in "low-risk things," such as proxy "pot shots" at [[usisrael_relations | American bases]] in places like Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. However, these actions have not resulted in significant casualties or damage, limiting the need for a U.S. military response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. [[irans_approach_to_the_israel_hamas_situation | Iran]] is not expected to risk a broader confrontation with the American Navy in the Gulf to defend Hamas, a group they have publicly denounced as "apostates and animals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. While [[irans_approach_to_the_israel_hamas_situation | Iran]] may have "nudged Hamas" regarding the timing of their actions, they are "certainly not going to bleed for them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

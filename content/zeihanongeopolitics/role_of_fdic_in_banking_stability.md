The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) plays a crucial role in maintaining stability within the [[banking_issues_in_the_united_states_in_2023 | United States banking system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:27">[01:46:27]</a>. It functions as an insurance system for bank depositors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:55">[01:54:55]</a>.

## How the FDIC Works

All banks contribute a monthly fee into the FDIC system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:50">[01:51:50]</a>. This collective funding provides insurance for depositors. As a standard measure, any deposit under $250,000 is federally guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:05">[02:01:05]</a>, meaning the depositor will get their money back without requiring direct intervention from the federal government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:09">[02:06:09]</a>.

## FDIC's Response to Recent Banking Issues (March 2023)

In March 2023, during a period described as a "banking hiccup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a> where banks like Silvergate, Signature, and Silicon Valley failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>:

*   The FDIC system activated, ensuring depositors would be "made whole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:47">[02:09:47]</a>.
*   For deposits under the $250,000 limit, the FDIC inherently manages the return of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:03">[05:12:03]</a>.
*   However, many startup companies, particularly those served by Silicon Valley Bank, held deposits significantly exceeding the quarter-million-dollar insurance limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:47">[05:20:47]</a>. Uninsured deposits normally receive no guarantee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:04">[05:33:04]</a>.
*   The [[biden_administrations_response_to_banking_issues_and_moral_hazard | Biden Administration]] chose to intervene, announcing that all depositors, regardless of deposit size, would be fully reimbursed by the FDIC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:37">[05:37:37]</a>.
*   To finance this, all banks will face slightly higher payments into the FDIC system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:40">[05:44:40]</a>, ensuring taxpayers are not directly burdened by the bailout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:03">[05:52:03]</a>.

## Impact of the FDIC's Action

The decision to guarantee all deposits, even those above the standard limit, effectively placed a "hard stop" on the risk of a widespread bank run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:08">[05:57:08]</a>, demonstrating the FDIC's ability to act as a critical backstop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:23">[06:43:23]</a>. This was considered "the right tool for the job" to prevent broader financial contagion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:26">[06:00:26]</a>.

### Moral Hazard Concerns
However, this action also introduces what is known as [[biden_administrations_response_to_banking_issues_and_moral_hazard | moral hazard]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:11">[06:37:11]</a>. Critics suggest it encourages companies to continue making imprudent financial decisions, as they may expect a bailout, thereby injecting a "permanent level of stupidity" into the financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>. The cost of this blanket guarantee may be borne by all bank customers through potentially lower interest rates on deposits or more stringent loan conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:59">[06:09:59]</a>.

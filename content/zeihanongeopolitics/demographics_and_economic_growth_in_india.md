India is poised to emerge as a significant global power, anticipated to avoid many of the negative impacts expected to sweep across the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The nation's energy supply from the Persian Gulf is secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, and its agricultural system is largely self-sufficient, including fertilizer production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. India's geographical position also means it is not dependent on global trade, similar to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Historically, India chose not to fully integrate into the economic aspects of the global order, perceiving it as an American design and tilting towards the Soviets during the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This stance suggests that while a collapse of the current global system would affect India, the impact would be less severe and prolonged compared to other nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Manufacturing Landscape

India's manufacturing sector has been significantly impacted by [[Chinas demographic challenges and economic growth|China's development process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Historically, middle powers produced a substantial portion of their own manufactured goods until China's emergence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. China's ability to produce at scale with subsidies and deliberate economic penetration policies drove much industry out of business globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Consequently, India experienced a similar influx of Chinese products that displaced local manufacturers, mirroring the situation in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

As the [[Chinas demographic challenges and economic growth|Chinese system]] approaches its end, India, like the US, will need to rebuild its domestic manufacturing capabilities if it wishes to acquire goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Unlike the US, which benefits from partners and allies like Mexico and Canada for such endeavors, India lacks similar external support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Its relationships with neighboring states are generally hostile, with Pakistan being the most significant example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

However, India possesses a diverse range of skill sets internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Given its vast size, India can achieve a form of US-Mexican style manufacturing synergy within its own borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Despite this internal potential, the technological level, capital investment, and operating environment will be more challenging, resulting in a lower quality and variety of products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. India has the potential to become a global manufacturing superpower for its own market of 1.5 billion people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, serving as an emblematic example of the forthcoming fragmentation of global manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## [[Demographic shifts and economic implications|Demographic Dividend]] and [[Economic Growth Models of India and China|Economic Growth Potential]]

India is a relatively young country, though not as young as some may believe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The concept of a [[Demographic shifts and economic implications|demographic dividend]] is often discussed in India, referring to its large population under 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. However, like many industrialized nations, India has experienced a plummeting birth rate, which began approximately 35 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This has created a demographic profile with a pure pyramid at the top that widens significantly around the 35-year-old age group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

This specific [[Demographic shifts and economic implications|demographic structure]] enables a period of hyper-charged [[Economic Growth Models of India and China|economic growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. A large segment of the population aged 20 to 45, with fewer children, tends to spend on consumer goods like cars and vacations instead of diapers and preschool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. This type of spending generates higher-octane growth, is more productive, and creates more supply chain steps, leading to a robust [[Economic Growth Models of India and China|economic growth]] experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

While India's birth rate has not declined as rapidly as in countries like Japan, Korea, China, or Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, it is a trend to monitor. Even in a worst-case scenario where the current rate of decline persists, India is not expected to face a German-style [[Demographics and economic challenges in Europe|economic embalmment]] within 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This provides India with a substantial 40-year runway for development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Given its size, diversity, and stability, India is one of the few countries that could potentially alter its [[Demographic shifts and economic implications|demographic trajectory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

## Strategic Position and International Relations

India is characterized as a "pocket power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Its region is geographically bounded by hostile nations (e.g., Pakistan), deserts, mountains (Himalayas), or dense jungles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Even if India could conquer all its border countries, it would not significantly expand its [[Economic Growth Models of India and China|economic footprint]] or improve its strategic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This limits India's influence primarily to the Indian Ocean Basin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Furthermore, due to numerous potential land-based adversaries, India is unlikely to ever become a significant naval power capable of projecting force beyond its immediate region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. While Indians often speak of their nation as an emerging global power, it is geographically constrained from breaking out of this box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Conversely, this also makes it difficult for other powers to penetrate India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

Recent US strategic policy has attempted to draw India away from its historical pro-Soviet leanings, but these efforts are unlikely to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. India's foreign policy is driven by its own national interests; it has no history of alliances or deep trust-based relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. While cooperation with the US on a case-by-case basis is possible, India will never be an ally or a friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. This differs significantly from the bilateral relationships the US holds with Western nations or countries with which it has deep military ties, such as Taiwan, Korea, Japan, or Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

India's actions are solely determined by what it deems necessary for its own benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. For example, India is unlikely to provide significant assistance to Ukraine, nor will it be overly detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. In a dispute between the US and China, India might cheer from the sidelines but is unlikely to intervene unless it perceives a direct opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. In a future global energy crisis, India is anticipated to take unilateral action with its own forces for its own reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. The speaker suggests that in such a scenario, nations should be more concerned about India's actions in the Persian Gulf than those of the US, China, Japan, Britain, or France, given India's proximity and unique capability to project force there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. The US no longer maintains substantial forces in the Persian Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

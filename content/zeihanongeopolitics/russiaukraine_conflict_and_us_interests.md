The United States has not been involved in a major conflict on the scale of World War II since that war concluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Subsequent conflicts, such as Korea and Vietnam, were undertaken in the context of supporting the global order and allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Other engagements, like Desert Shield and Desert Storm, aimed to forge a new world post-Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Conditions for Direct US Military Intervention

For the US to become directly involved in a major conflict, two conditions are typically required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>:
1.  A political leader who views international issues as a crucible for forging a new national identity, though there is currently no sign of this across the political spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
2.  An entity doing something "breathtakingly stupid and provoking" towards the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Historical examples include Pearl Harbor, the Cuban Missile Crisis, Sputnik, and the Kuwait invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

Currently, China is not considered "dumb enough" to provoke the US in such a way, as they understand a conflict on water would halt their critical imports and lead to economic suicide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## The Russia-Ukraine Conflict and US Engagement

The only country that might currently trigger a direct US intervention due to "incompetence" is [[potential_conflicts_with_russia_and_china | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

> [!quote] "We've we've learned over the last three years that Russia doesn't have a classic Army in the sense that most people think of the word they basically have a mob that they put guns into their hands and throw them at things and it's not that that's a strategy that has never worked for the Russians the Russians have one half of the wars that they've been in..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>

A direct clash between the US and [[potential_conflicts_with_russia_and_china | Russia]] would occur if the fight directly impacts US interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. If [[russian_military_strategies_and_advancements_in_ukraine | Ukraine]] were to fall and the United States remained passively interested in NATO, it would lead to a more direct conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. However, the US is not currently in a direct fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Even if [[russian_military_strategies_and_advancements_in_ukraine | Russia]] continues its current pace of gains for the next five years, it is unlikely to trigger direct US involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

The dynamic of the [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Russia-Ukraine conflict]] is complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. While [[russian_military_strategies_and_advancements_in_ukraine | Russia]] is not expected to suddenly break through lines and win, a conflict of that scale would be required for the US to consider direct involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, barring a direct attack on the US homeland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. The US military has significantly "rested and recruited" since the War on Terror, with few current occupations or hot deployments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## North American Considerations

Currently, there are no viable threats within North America that would necessitate US military intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The primary concern that could theoretically involve the military in the region is dealing with Mexico's drug cartels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. US demand for cocaine has severely impacted the rule of law in large parts of Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, exacerbated by the "incompetence" of the AMLO administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

Any military solution to the cartel issue would require close cooperation with the Mexican administration, similar to the US approach with Colombia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. A unilateral US military intervention without Mexican participation would sever the crucial trade relationship, potentially leading to a severe US economic depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

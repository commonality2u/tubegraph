On the evening of July 13, 2024, [[Donald Trumps cognitive state | Donald Trump]] was lightly injured in an assassination attempt in Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Initial details suggest the assailant was a 20-year-old registered Republican who had also donated to Democrats, though specific information remains scarce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The Secret Service, in cooperation with local law enforcement and the FBI, is conducting an investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Broader Context of Political Volatility

This event is situated within a period of increasing political volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Two major shifts are contributing to this environment:

### United States Political Rearrangement

The United States is undergoing a "once-in-a-generation political rearrangement," with [[Donald Trumps proposed military actions against Panama | Donald Trump]] being a significant part of this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The American political system, characterized by first-past-the-post, single-member districts, means voters choose an individual representative for a specific geography rather than a party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. As a result, American political parties tend to be weak coalitions of various factions banding together to secure a majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

Historically, the Republican Party comprised factions concerned with budget deficits, national security, business regulation, and social conservatism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. However, as technology, demographics, and economic patterns evolve, these traditional factions are becoming less cohesive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. When stressed, factions may leave their coalitions, becoming swing voters or shifting to the opposing side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

Currently, the [[Impact of Donald Trump on the Republican Coalition | Republican Coalition]] has seen its business, national security, and fiscal communities largely ejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Conversely, [[Impact of Donald Trump on midterm elections | Donald Trump]] has successfully attracted new groups from the Democratic Coalition, including union voters and Hispanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This ongoing political realignment is influenced by the rise and fall of hyper-globalization and the retirement of the Baby Boomer generation from the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### Global Economic Movement

The world is also experiencing a significant economic transformation as the post-World War II global consensus breaks down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This consensus was built on the premise that the United States would provide global security and open markets in exchange for Cold War alliances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This framework supported alliances like NATO and the partnerships with Taiwan, Korea, and Japan, and enabled the rise of countries such as China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

This system is now faltering for two primary reasons:
1.  **US Capacity and Willingness:** The United States can no longer afford or is unwilling to sustain its previous global security role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Its naval structure has shifted from broad patrol capabilities to smaller clusters optimized for warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Politically, Americans are increasingly resistant to bearing the economic costs of maintaining open global markets, especially when it is perceived as disadvantaging American workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
2.  **Demographic Shifts:** Decades of global urbanization have led to declining birth rates worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The 2020s are projected to be the decade when many countries face a shrinking workforce unable to support the current globalized system, as consumption—and thus trade—depends on sufficient populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Implications for Stability

These converging political and economic shifts mean profound changes in daily life, work, business, and supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Such periods of change can generate fear and anger, leading to violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

*   **State-Level Conflicts:** This volatility is expected to manifest in increased military conflicts between states, with the war in Ukraine being an example, and potential future conflicts involving China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Domestic Political Violence:** In the United States, significant political realignments historically correlate with domestic political violence, seen during the Great Depression of the 1930s, Reconstruction, and the Civil War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

While the United States may ultimately benefit from these transformations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, the transition from a familiar past to an unknown future is expected to generate considerable stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, as exemplified by the assassination attempt on [[Potential Issues with Donald Trumps Influence in Future Elections | Donald Trump]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

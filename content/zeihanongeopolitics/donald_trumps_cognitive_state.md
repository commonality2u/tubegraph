The term used to describe what is happening with [[Donald Trumps cognitive state | Donald Trump's mind]] is "dementing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

## Characteristics and Manifestations
*   **Self-Created Reality** [[Donald Trumps cognitive state | Trump]] is very sure of where he is because he has made it up, living in a bubble of his own mental creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.
*   **Anger when Challenged** When someone pokes into this self-created bubble, he becomes very angry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. This behavior has been observed for some time but has accelerated since he lost the presidential re-election three years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. He significantly emphasized this in the [[presidential_debate_analysis | debate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.
*   **Falsehoods** In the [[presidential_debate_analysis | debate]], 75% to 80% of what [[Donald Trumps cognitive state | Donald Trump]] said was a "bald-faced lie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. Most of these lies have been disproven in court multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. Some new lies introduced during the [[presidential_debate_analysis | debate]] were attributed to Vivek Ramaswamy, who was considered the candidate most detached from reality during the Republican primaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
*   **Insistence on Stolen Election** Part of his dementia is an insistence that the election was stolen from him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>, despite members of his own administration in charge of election integrity stating it was the cleanest election ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. This threatens independents by suggesting the general election doesn't matter and everything should be decided in primaries, where he performs well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

## Implications for Presidency
*   **Unfit for Office** As [[Donald Trumps cognitive state | Donald Trump]] ages, his "bad days" are expected to outnumber his "good days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. At 79 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>, he is no longer considered fit to be president, and a vote for him is viewed as a vote against national stability in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.
*   **Impact on the Republican Party** [[Donald Trumps cognitive state | Donald Trump]] has destroyed the [[impact_of_donald_trump_on_the_republican_coalition | Republican Party]] by purging anyone against him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. A significant turning point was when he took over the Republican National Committee in March, immediately purging individuals involved in polling, candidate selection, or any political experience, replacing them with his loyalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>. His grip on the remaining [[impact_of_donald_trump_on_the_republican_coalition | Republican Party]] is so firm that even if he were to die, he would likely still be the Republican nominee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.
*   **Election Dynamics** While [[Joe Bidens cognitive state | Joe Biden's cognitive state]] is described as "deluding" and [[Donald Trumps cognitive state | Trump's]] as "dementing," voters face a choice between someone deluded or someone whose dementia threatens the future ability to vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. For Independents, [[Donald Trumps cognitive state | Trump's]] insistence that the general election doesn't matter effectively negates their vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.
*   **Primary System Influence** [[Donald Trumps cognitive state | Trump's]] ability to sweep the primaries without extensive campaigning was seen as impressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. His "Maga crowd" supporters show up in force to primaries even when he isn't campaigning for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

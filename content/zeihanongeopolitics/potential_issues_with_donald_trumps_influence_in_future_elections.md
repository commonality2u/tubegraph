Peter Z outlines why [[2024_us_presidential_election_predictions | Donald Trump]] has "no chance of winning the general election," assuming he is not disqualified or in jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This assessment is based on the mechanics of the U.S. electoral system and the evolving nature of political party coalitions.

## The American Electoral System: Two-Party Dynamics

The U.S. operates under a "first past the post single member district system," meaning voters choose one person representing a specific geographic area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This system encourages the formation of two large, "big tent" political parties, as they must secure the marginal vote to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Historically, third or fourth parties in the U.S. rarely last beyond one or two political cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

Within these big tent parties, various power centers and factions emerge, whose influence rises and falls with changes in technology, geopolitics, and social issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The last 30 years have seen significant transitions, such as hyper-globalization followed by de-globalization, the rise of the information economy and social media, and the mass retirement of Baby Boomers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Understanding these internal factional dynamics is crucial.

## Traditional Party Coalitions

### The Republican Coalition: Solid but Smaller

Historically, Republicans have faced a numerical disadvantage with fewer voters and factions compared to Democrats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Their coalition traditionally includes:
*   Pro-lifers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>
*   Military voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>
*   Law and Order voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>
*   Business voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>

Despite smaller numbers, this coalition has been very solid and reliable because the issues typically don't clash; for example, pro-lifers generally don't care about business regulation, and the business community isn't typically concerned with military policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This cohesion ensures high voter turnout within the base, allowing them to win by attracting a few Independents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### The Democratic Coalition: Broader but Prone to Division

Democrats cast a very wide net, with a primary three-part coalition:
*   Minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>
*   Coastal Highly Educated Elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>
*   Organized Labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>

The challenge for this coalition arises when candidates discuss specific policies, as it's difficult to find issues all three factions agree upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Examples of internal conflict include:
*   **Social issues**: The term "LatinX," pushed by some educated elites, has no roots in Latin culture and is largely found pointless or offensive by Hispanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Green Revolution**: While coastal educated folks support the Green Revolution, unions are less enthusiastic because many new jobs are not unionized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

When candidates like Michael Dukakis or Hillary Clinton run on specific issues, it can create infighting and lead to chunks of the Democratic electorate not showing up to vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. To win, Democrats often need a charismatic candidate who doesn't delve deeply into policy specifics, as exemplified by Barack Obama's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## [[impact_of_donald_trump_on_the_republican_coalition | Donald Trump]]'s Impact on the Republican Coalition

Normally, Republicans hold an advantage due to fewer wedge issues within their coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. However, [[impact_of_donald_trump_on_the_republican_coalition | Donald Trump]] has "shaken up the race" by introducing wedge issues not just across society, but specifically within the Republican electorate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

Examples of these new internal conflicts include:
*   **Military vs. Abortion Policy**: Actions by figures like Tommy Tuberville, who for months prevented military promotions over abortion policy, have pitted military voters against abortion votersâ€”two factions that previously had no reason to fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Alienation of the Business Community**: [[impact_of_donald_trump_on_the_republican_coalition | Donald Trump]] has "driven the business community out of the Coalition" because he dislikes dissent and sought adoration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This has created a complete alienation between business and social conservative voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

This environment forces Republicans to face a "Democratic-style cohesion test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Even if they pass this test, they still have fewer voters than Democrats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. If [[2024_us_presidential_election_predictions | Donald Trump]] becomes the candidate, it is unlikely that their entire traditional coalition will show up to vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This mathematical disadvantage, even before considering independent voters, suggests that [[impact_of_donald_trump_on_midterm_elections | Donald Trump]] cannot win on the numbers alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

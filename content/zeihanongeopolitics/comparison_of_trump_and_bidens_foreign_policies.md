The current political landscape raises the possibility of the United States experiencing its first extended period of agreement in foreign policy across administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

## Historical Context of Recent Foreign Policy

Before the current administration, the United States saw varied approaches to foreign policy:
*   **Obama Administration** For most of his presidency, Barack Obama was noted for rarely engaging in conversations regarding foreign policy, leading to a period with effectively no foreign policy for seven of his eight years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   **Trump Administration** [[United States foreign policy management under Trump | Donald Trump]] would announce policies via tweets, but little action followed because he rarely engaged in constructive conversations with government officials, bureaucracy, or Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. At one point, he even stated his tweets served as notifications to Congress regarding policies, which is legally unsound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Consequently, very little federal foreign policy action occurred during his four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

## Trump and Biden: Shared Economic Foreign Policy Approach

Despite their political differences, President Joe Biden largely shares [[United States foreign policy management under Trump | Trump]]'s approach to foreign *economic* policy-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Both administrations' foreign economic policies are characterized by being extraordinarily populist and nationalist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

### Key Difference: Implementation and Governance
The fundamental difference between the two lies in their belief in government and ability to engage in meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Biden's Method** Unlike [[United States foreign policy management under Trump | Trump]], Joe Biden believes in the power of government and is capable of sitting through meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. He has been actively reviewing [[United States foreign policy management under Trump | Donald Trump]]'s past tweets and systematically converting them into foreign economic policy, embedding them within governance and the American government bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

### Perceived Outcomes and Reactions
This continuity and implementation strategy has led to ironic outcomes for supporters of both parties:
*   **Biden Supporters:** May feel frustrated that President Biden is adopting cues from [[United States foreign policy management under Trump | Trump]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
*   **Trump Supporters:** May feel frustrated that Biden is receiving credit for policies and economic decisions initially conceived by [[United States foreign policy management under Trump | Trump]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

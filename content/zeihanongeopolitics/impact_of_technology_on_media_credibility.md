The rise of technology has significantly impacted media credibility, leading to a less informed populace and an environment where propaganda thrives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. For a population to be well-informed, multiple credible sources of information are necessary, allowing for agreement on basic facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This system of checks and balances no longer robustly exists in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Historical Erosion of Fact-Checking

The decline in media credibility began in the 1980s with technological advancements:

*   **Fax Machine (1980s)**: Traditionally, major newspapers and TV stations maintained numerous roving reporters, including those stationed abroad, ensuring multiple eyes on stories, fact checks, and editorial oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The fax machine reduced the need for extensive foreign staffing and led to the disappearance of copy editors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Email and Attachments (1990s)**: The advent of email further decreased the number of staff required abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Internet Rise (2000s)**: By the 2000s, most foreign bureaus were gone, replaced by a few roving reporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. As the internet gained prominence and cost-cutting became a priority, these roving reporters were also largely eliminated, with media relying instead on local stringers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. While local insights were still gathered, they were no longer fact-checked and could be biased by the proclivities of the information gatherers, lacking a backstop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Modern Day Impact: [[role_of_algorithms_and_fake_news | Algorithms]] and Propaganda

Today, [[role_of_algorithms_and_fake_news | algorithms]] are increasingly used to write newspaper stories and scrape the web for information, leading to a significant reduction in fact-checking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This environment makes it easy for charismatic politicians to dismiss unwelcome information as "fake news" and for political movements to form around individuals rather than verifiable facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The necessary factfulness for an educated populace is largely gone, with people placing trust in a person over institutions or information venues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Global Parallels to an Information Desert

The current information landscape in the United States, described as an "information desert," is not entirely new and has parallels in other regions:

*   **Middle East**: In regions with single-party rule, there is often an information vacuum where the rumor mill becomes the primary news source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This has made it difficult to establish basic truths, with rumors spread via email and Twitter gaining acceptance as fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Russia**: The rumor mill is augmented by a state monopoly on information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Information obtained from official radio or TV channels is considered 100% Russian propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## The US Media Landscape: Business and Opinion

Unlike state-controlled media, the US media operates as a business with high capital expenditure, prioritizing viewership and catering to what people want to hear over truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

*   **Opinion-Based Programming**: Channels like Fox and MSNBC are now primarily opinion programs with very little news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Newsmax, for example, is described as 100% opinion, resembling media environments found in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **[[impact_of_misinformation_on_social_media | Social Media]] as News Source**:
    *   Traditional nightly news broadcasts are now largely composed of drug commercials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
    *   Those aged 25-45 often get news from [[impact_of_misinformation_on_social_media | Facebook]], considered among the worst sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
    *   Individuals under 25 frequently get news from TikTok, which is considered an improvement over [[impact_of_misinformation_on_social_media | Facebook]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

## Seeking Credible News Sources

Finding reliable news sources in this environment requires discernment:

*   **International News Sources**:
    *   **Al Jazeera**: Considered the most reliable international news source overall, known for interviewing multiple people with multiple viewpoints, though heavily biased on Middle East affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
    *   **France 24**: Ranks second and is one of the few entities still maintaining global bureaus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
    *   **BBC**: Has significantly declined in credibility over the last two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
    *   **Canadian Broadcasting**: Considered the "bottom of the barrel," being 100% opinion and party line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
    *   **Local News Sources Globally**: Can offer biased but unique perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

*   **US National News Sources**:
    *   **The Wall Street Journal**: Considered worthy of consideration, though it focuses almost exclusively on financial news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
    *   **Bloomberg**: While not as good as it once was, it offers a broad and even-handed coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
    *   **Straight Arrow News**: A new project aiming to provide non-partisan views from contributors across the political spectrum on topics ranging from finance to international affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

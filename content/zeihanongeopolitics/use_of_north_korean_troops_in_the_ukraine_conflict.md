## Deployment and Tactics
[[north_korean_involvement_in_the_ukraine_war | North Korean]] troops are being used by the [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Russians]] in the northern part of the [[ukrainian_incursion_into_russian_territory | Ukraine]] conflict, specifically in Kursk (KK) province, which is technically within [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Russian]] territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Russians]] are employing "human wave tactics" using these [[north_korean_involvement_in_the_ukraine_war | North Korean]] soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Evidence suggests that [[north_korean_involvement_in_the_ukraine_war | North Korean]] soldiers have received instructions to have one individual stand in a field to attract enemy drones, while others remain on the edges of forests, shooting at the drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Casualties and Motivation
Casualties and fatalities among the [[north_korean_involvement_in_the_ukraine_war | North Korean]] forces have been described as horrific, even by [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Russian]] standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The 12,000 [[north_korean_involvement_in_the_ukraine_war | North Koreans]] deployed are characterized as "suicidal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Based on interrogations of captured soldiers and analysis of captured equipment, it is apparent that [[north_korean_involvement_in_the_ukraine_war | North Korean]] soldiers were threatened with the killing of their families back home if they defected or failed to follow orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Strategic Impact
While 12,000 troops represent a significant number, this deployment is not expected to be a decisive factor in the war, as the [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Russians]] reportedly lose a similar number of personnel within a few weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. As of the stated period, there has been no indication of additional [[north_korean_involvement_in_the_ukraine_war | North Korean]] troops arriving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

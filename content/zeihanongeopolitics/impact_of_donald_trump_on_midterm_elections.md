In the 2022 midterm elections, the anticipated "red wave" for Republicans did not materialize as widely predicted, instead resulting in what was described as "at best a red fizzle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44">[01:44]</a>. This outcome was significantly influenced by former President [[impact_of_donald_trump_on_the_republican_coalition | Donald Trump's]] actions and rhetoric leading up to the elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16">[01:16]</a>.

## Donald Trump's Influence and Independent Voters

For two years prior to the 2022 midterms, [[impact_of_donald_trump_on_the_republican_coalition | Donald Trump]] asserted to [[impact_of_independents_in_elections | Independents]] that their votes were inconsequential and that election outcomes should be decided at the primary level rather than in general elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16">[01:16]</a>. This stance prompted a strong reaction from "America's True [[impact_of_independents_in_elections | Independents]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29">[01:29]</a>.

Historically, [[impact_of_independents_in_elections | Independents]] have been the decisive voting bloc in most presidential elections over the last three decades, often swinging outcomes by 5 to 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49">[00:49]</a>. This group has demonstrated a tendency to switch sides every two or three elections due to "buyer remorse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53">[01:53]</a>.

## The 2022 Midterm Outcome

In the 2022 midterms, [[impact_of_donald_trump_on_the_republican_coalition | Donald Trump's]] direct involvement proved counterproductive for his endorsed candidates. In nearly every race where he "put his finger on" a candidate, the Democrats emerged victorious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34">[01:34]</a>. This indicated that [[impact_of_donald_trump_on_the_republican_coalition | Trump's]] rhetoric had significantly alienated [[impact_of_independents_in_elections | Independent]] voters to their "core" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00">[02:00]</a>, leading them to vote against his preferred candidates in consecutive elections (2020 and 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05">[02:05]</a>.

### Independent Voter Behavior
The behavior of [[impact_of_independents_in_elections | Independent]] voters in 2022 saw them break "very very strongly against Trump" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26">[03:26]</a>. This pattern, where [[impact_of_independents_in_elections | Independents]] strongly favored the Democratic party, was a key factor in preventing a large Republican victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29">[02:29]</a>.

## Broader Implications

The 2022 midterms demonstrated that while [[impact_of_independents_in_elections | Independents]] continued their trend of voting against [[impact_of_donald_trump_on_the_republican_coalition | Trump]], other demographic groups shifted their votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30">[03:30]</a>. Despite the continued opposition from [[impact_of_independents_in_elections | Independents]], the election results also indicated a period of [[political_realignment_in_the_united_states | political realignment]] within the United States, as party loyalties are clearly shifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24">[05:24]</a>.

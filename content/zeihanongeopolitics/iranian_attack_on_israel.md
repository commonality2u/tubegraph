On April 14th, Iran launched the largest assault from another country into Israel since the wars of the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This attack involved over 300 missiles, drones, and an assortment of artillery rockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Projectiles were launched from multiple locations, including Iran proper, Yemen via the Houthis, proxies in Syria, and Hezbollah in Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Motivations and Context

The stated reason for the attack was Israel's recent targeting of embassy property in Damascus, which resulted in the elimination of several senior Iranian paramilitary commanders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

This event is situated within the broader context of the conflict that began with the [[hamas_attacks_on_israel | assault from Gaza upon Israelis]] in October <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. While Gaza itself is described as territorially insignificant and without inherent strategic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, external parties, including Iran, have chosen to assign value to it to justify their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. For Iran, the situation provides an opportunity to "needle" Israelis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Despite this, Iran has publicly referred to Hamas as "animals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

Israel's response to the October events has been characterized by a "let's not mess around right now" mode, leading to more forceful retaliation than what is sent against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. An example of this was the consulate bombing in Damascus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## Nature of the Attack: Political Theater

The [[irans_political_objectives_and_actions | Iranian attack]] was highly telegraphed, with Iran publicly announcing its intentions for several days prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. The Swiss Embassy, which handles diplomatic communications between the United States and Iran, was actively used by Iran to communicate details about the attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Iran disclosed the types of weapons to be used, their launch locations, and flight paths to ensure that Israel and its allies could intercept as much as possible, thereby minimizing damage and avoiding further retaliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

Within minutes of the launches, the Iranian government issued an official proclamation, both from Tehran and via its UN office, stating that their objectives had been achieved and the operation was concluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Outcome and Aftermath

The majority of projectiles were intercepted by Israel, Jordan, the United States, and the United Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Not a single person was killed, and damage was largely limited to what was hit by a few artillery rockets from Hezbollah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The Iron Dome missile defense system performed effectively, especially given that the incoming threats were known in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

Iran hopes that its declaration of the mission's completion will be accepted, leading to no further action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. The United States shares this hope, as it seeks to disengage from the region more broadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

The decision for further action now rests with Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Israel's heightened sensitivity following the October events could lead to a knee-jerk reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Additionally, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's political calculations play a role; extending the security issue could serve his personal interest in avoiding elections where he would likely face a landslide loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. The situation remains fluid, with a potential Israeli retaliation possible within 96 hours of the attack, or a calming of tensions if no immediate response occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

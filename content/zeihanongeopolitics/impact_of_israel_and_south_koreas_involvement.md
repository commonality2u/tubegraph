The involvement of North Korea and Iran in supporting Russia's war effort in Ukraine has led to a shift in the strategic calculus, bringing [[political_dynamics_in_israel | Israel]] and South Korea into more active roles in the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>. Both nations had previously sought to avoid significant involvement due to their own pressing security concerns closer to home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. However, Russia's indirect engagement in their respective regions has loosened political restrictions in Jerusalem and Seoul, leading to potential significant impacts on the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.

## North Korean and Iranian Support for Russia

Russia has become dependent on external military aid from countries not considered technological leaders, highlighting a weakness in its own military-industrial complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. This dependency suggests Russia may become increasingly reliant on weapon imports in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>.

### North Korea's Contribution
There are reports of [[north_korean_involvement_in_the_ukraine_war | North Korean troops]] deploying to Russia, with technical advisors already assisting Russians in using North Korean weaponry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. South Korea has intercepted discussions from Pyongyang about actual troop deployments, potentially even for frontline combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. While confirmation is difficult, South Korean intelligence is generally considered reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

[[north_korean_involvement_in_the_ukraine_war | North Korea]] is providing ballistic missiles and artillery shells, potentially accounting for half of the artillery shells used by Russia in Ukraine this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. These shells are of poor quality, sometimes causing more damage to Russian artillery tubes than to Ukrainian targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

### Iranian Contribution
Iran has supplied Russia with Shahed drones, with over a thousand having been used in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

## Strategic Opportunities for the US and Allies

The involvement of North Korea and Iran provides an "intelligence bonanza" for the United States and its allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>:

*   **Intelligence on North Korean Military:** Since [[historical_context_of_the_israel_palestine_conflict | North Korea]] has not been in a fight since 1953, any information on its soldiers' performance in real-world scenarios would be invaluable for remaking war plans for the Korean Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.
*   **Targeting Iranian Drone Production:** [[political_dynamics_in_israel | Israel]] has recently faced ballistic missile attacks from Iran and is eager to respond, with the Biden Administration giving a de facto "green light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. This presents an opportunity for [[political_dynamics_in_israel | Israel]] to include Iranian drone manufacturing facilities as targets in its retaliation, thereby removing a significant source of military capability for Russia in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. Given that Iran is not a technological leader, the number of personnel capable of assembling these drones is limited, making them vulnerable targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. [[political_dynamics_in_israel | Israeli]] operations could also extend to targeting drone technicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.

## South Korea and Israel's Potential Contributions

The direct involvement of North Korea and Iran in the Ukraine conflict has indirectly drawn [[political_dynamics_in_israel | Israel]] and South Korea into the situation, opening new avenues for support to Ukraine and the broader Western alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.

### South Korea's Role
South Korea is one of the world's five biggest arms exporters, producing high-quality artillery, rocket systems, and tanks at a significantly lower price point than European or American counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. They have already committed to providing Poland with over a thousand tanks and associated systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>. Providing this assistance to Ukraine is a logical next step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.

### Israel's Role
[[political_dynamics_in_israel | Israel]] is a world leader in anti-missile technologies and possesses the world's best anti-artillery and anti-rocket technology, exemplified by its Iron Dome system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.

### Strategic Cooperation
A theoretical Korean War would see North Korea launching significant amounts of ammunition into Seoul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. If [[political_dynamics_in_israel | Israel]] can assist South Korea with artillery and rocket defense, cooperation between the two countries could significantly alter their respective strategic calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. This collaboration could combine [[political_dynamics_in_israel | Israel]]'s technical acumen in specific weapon systems with South Korea's capacity for rapid mass production, benefiting the entire Western Alliance system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
Russia's decision to involve [[north_korean_involvement_in_the_ukraine_war | North Korea]] in the Ukraine war, while offering tactical ammunition benefits, is seen as a strategic miscalculation. It has inadvertently drawn in important players like South Korea and [[political_dynamics_in_israel | Israel]], potentially bringing their significant military and technological capabilities to bear against the Russian war machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>.

Since the Kerch Bridge attack, Russian military logistics in Ukraine have faced significant challenges. Recent events, including Ukrainian targeting shifts and an internal Russian conflict, have further compounded these issues, creating a critical window of vulnerability for Russian forces.

## Key Logistical Hubs and Their Vulnerabilities

### Rostov-on-Don
Rostov-on-Don serves as the primary logistical and communications point for the Russian military throughout the Ukrainian War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. It is also the main jumping-off point for Russian forces moving into Crimea and the southern front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Its capture by the Wagner paramilitary group significantly disrupted Russia's ability to reinforce or supply its troops in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

### Kerch Bridge
The Kerch Bridge, attacked last summer, features two two-lane road connections and one rail connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. The attack took out one road connection and started fires on a rail car, warping the bridge and making the rail system impassable for cargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This forced Russia to shift its supply routes to land connections into Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Months later, the rail connection has still not been rebuilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, raising questions about Russia's technical capacity due to a decades-long decline in technical education and demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### Chonhar Crossing
The Chonhar Crossing provides both rail and road connections into Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Ukrainian forces targeted these connections with a specialized warhead, creating significant holes that render them impassable for trucks and rail until repairs are completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. While repairs are possible, they are expected to take weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

### Severed Supply Lines
The damage to the Chonhar Bridge, combined with the earlier issues at the Kerch Bridge, means that most cargo going to and from Ukraine must now use the less efficient Western land bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. This has created a critical situation for Russian troops west of Mariupol, who have been largely cut off from supplies originating from Russia proper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

### [[Impact of equipment and manpower shortages on Russian military | Shortages and Vulnerability]]
The [[destruction_of_russian_logistics_and_supply_lines | disruption of logistics and supply lines]] means that Russian soldiers in the Melitopol area are now vulnerable and isolated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. They are unable to receive reinforcements, fuel, or vital artillery shells and ammunition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

## Ukrainian Counter-Offensive Opportunities
The Ukrainian counter-offensive, which had been bogged down by [[russian_defensive_positions and supply challenges | Russian defensive positions]] like minefields and anti-tank barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, now faces an unprecedented opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

### Strategic Shift in Ukrainian Targeting
Ukrainians shifted their missile strategy from targeting command and control bunkers to targeting [[impact_on_russian_ammunition_depots | ammo dumps]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This change is typically indicative of preparing for a major push, aiming to prevent Russian forces from receiving meaningful supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Exploiting the Window of Opportunity
The combination of Ukraine's targeting of key supply bridges and the internal Russian conflict disrupting Rostov-on-Don creates a critical window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. If Ukrainian forces can push down to the Sea of Azov, they could isolate the entire southwestern front and Crimea, severing the land bridge between Russia proper and Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This would allow them to directly target the Kerch Bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The current logistical disarray presents a golden opportunity for Ukraine to make a significant advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

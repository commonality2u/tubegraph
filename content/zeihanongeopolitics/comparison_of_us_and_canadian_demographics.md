Former President Donald Trump's consideration of using [[economic coercion and USCanada relations | economic coercion]] against [[Canadas relationship with the United States | Canada]] brings to light the distinct demographic profiles of the two North American neighbors, particularly in the context of potential [[potential economic and political integration between the US and Canada | economic and political integration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The [[impact of demographics on economic future | demographic challenges]] for [[Canada]] are significant, especially if a merger with the United States were to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Demographic Structures: US vs. Canada

Demographic structures can be visualized as a pyramid, where a broad base of children tapers to fewer older adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. As societies industrialize and urbanize, child mortality decreases, leading to a "chimney" shape where more people live longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Eventually, birth rates decline, causing the pyramid to invert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

The United States generally maintains a "chimney" demographic stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. In contrast, [[Canada]] has "opened up" more, indicating a more inverted demographic structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

### Provincial Demographic Variations in Canada

[[Canadas immigration strategy and demographics | Canada's demographics]] vary significantly by province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>:
*   **Prairie Provinces (Saskatchewan, Alberta)**: These regions exhibit a "pillar" shape, more akin to the United States' demographic structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Quebec**: This province is described as "full-on inverted," in the process of "dying out" and losing its workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   **Atlantic Provinces (Labrador, PEI, Nova Scotia)**: These provinces are in an even worse demographic position than Quebec, though they represent less than 10% of the Canadian population combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Ontario**: As [[Canada]]'s largest province economically and demographically, Ontario is rapidly aging towards a Quebec-style inversion and is projected to become another significant financial burden within a decade or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

## Financial Implications of Integration

If [[Canada]] and the United States were to merge, transforming Canadian provinces into American states, the integration would be extremely expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Even disregarding the entire Canadian social welfare model, which is costly, the demographic profile of [[Canada]] would heavily impact the U.S. federal budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

*   **Quebec's Burden**: Quebec would be the oldest of the new states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. The expenses for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid alone from absorbing Quebec's aging population would be "crushing" for the American federal budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Overall Costs**: Absorbing [[Canada]] could add an estimated $500 billion to $1 trillion annually in social spending just to maintain these aging and increasingly "ancient" populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

## A More Plausible Integration Scenario

A more realistic scenario for [[potential economic and political integration between the US and Canada | a Canadian-American merger]] would involve certain Canadian provinces choosing to join the United States for economic reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Provinces like Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Alberta might opt to join to avoid the financial responsibility of paying for the ongoing retirement costs of Quebec and the rapidly aging Ontario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. This concept, particularly concerning Alberta, was explored in the book "Accidental Superpower" in a chapter titled "The Alberta Question" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

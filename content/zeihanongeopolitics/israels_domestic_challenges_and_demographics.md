## Demographic and Economic Strain

Israel faces significant internal challenges stemming from its demographic trends and social support systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The government provides a social support network for a segment of its population that does not serve in the military or work, instead paying for them to study the Torah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This group tends to have more children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

Within as little as 30 to 40 years, this demographic group is projected to be nearly as populous as the rest of the country combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This dynamic already represents a considerable drag on the country's resources in terms of taxes and manpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Impact on National Power

Leaving aside future [[political_dynamics_in_israel | local political drama]], the future Israel is anticipated to be considerably less powerful than it currently is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. If a third to half of its population is effectively "on the Dole," the nation will lack the necessary personnel for technology research, military manning, and other essential functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Consequently, whatever [[Israels defense and political response | Israel has to do]], it will need to do with more "punch," as it cannot rely on its population numbers or economic strength to achieve its goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

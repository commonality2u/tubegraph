Recent weeks have seen two significant incidents involving Russia and China targeting Finland, which observers believe are intentional and coordinated acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Recent Incidents

### Russian Border Provocation
The [[Russian involvement and tactics | Russians]] have begun funneling illegal migrants from Central Asia and South Asia into the Finnish border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This act is considered intentional and premeditated, as the number of migrants surged from less than one per day to almost a thousand in an area considered a security zone by the [[Russian involvement and tactics | Russians]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Chinese Maritime Sabotage
A Chinese container ship, the "New Polar Bear," dropped its anchor in the Gulf of Finland between Finland and Estonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. It then dragged the anchor for approximately 20 miles along the seabed, severing a telecommunications cable and damaging a pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This incident is not considered accidental, and while the Chinese deny responsibility, the anchor has been matched to the vessel, leaving no doubt for the Finns and Estonians about what occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Strategic Intentions

These incidents are seen as deliberate actions with several strategic goals, demonstrating a new level of [[Cooperation between Russia and China | cooperation between Russia and China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Practice and Coordination
For the first time, Russia and China are functionally cooperating and coordinating actions across different theaters against the same country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This serves as practice for larger-scale operations, potentially testing the global response of the United States and its allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Challenging the US and NATO
These actions are considered "less than war scenarios" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The US does not consider itself capable of being involved in two major military operations simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Therefore, anything that forces the United States to look in two directions at once is a win for Russia and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. [[NATO's response to Russia and China | NATO countries]] have already begun changing their naval patrol patterns in response to the Chinese actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

The choice of Finland as a target stems from its recent decision to join [[NATO's response to Russia and China | NATO]], which has displeased the [[Russian involvement and tactics | Russians]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Finland's Response and Capabilities

### Historical Context: The Winter War
Until recently, Finland maintained official neutrality due to its apprehension about facing the Soviet Union and then Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. While not considering themselves weak, Finns acknowledge being outnumbered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

Historically, the Finnish chapter of World War II was known as the [[Finlands historical military preparedness | Winter War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. During this conflict, Stalin's troops suffered massacres, with casualty ratios of 20 to 41 in favor of the Finns during winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. However, once the snows melted, the Finns were forced to sue for peace, ceding territory where about a quarter of their pre-war population lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This event has never been forgotten by the Finns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Military Prowess
Since the [[Finlands historical military preparedness | Winter War]], the Finnish military has prepared for a potential conflict with the [[Russian involvement and tactics | Russians]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Finland is a creative country that has shown it can "punch well above its weight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. It arguably possesses the most effective per capita military in [[NATO's response to Russia and China | NATO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Finnish soldiers are natural sharpshooters and skilled skiers, which contributed to high Russian casualty ratios in historical conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Finns recently excelled in a biathlon competition during a [[NATO's response to Russia and China | NATO]] training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### [[Finlands alliances with Scandinavian countries | Alliances]]
Finland is not isolated; it has strong relationships with its "little brothers" Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. More importantly, it maintains excellent relations with its Scandinavian cousins: Denmark, Sweden, and Norway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Finland also has strong diplomatic ties with the United Kingdom and, now, the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## [[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Implications for Russia]]
By targeting Finland, Russia appears to have miscalculated, believing Finland was isolated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This choice highlights a breakdown in [[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russian diplomatic and security decision-making]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. The [[Russian involvement and tactics | Russians]] seem to have forgotten that even Stalin harbored some fear of the Finns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

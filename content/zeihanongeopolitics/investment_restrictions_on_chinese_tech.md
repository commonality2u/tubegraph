The Biden Administration has implemented new investment restrictions targeting Chinese technology firms, specifically private equity and venture capital firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. These measures aim to constrain capital flows into the Chinese tech space, particularly for technologies with military applications or those involved in artificial intelligence (AI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This is stated to be the first in a series of increasingly stringent restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## China's Investment Model

Counter-intuitively, the primary issue for China is not a lack of capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. China's government restricts investment options and limits money from flowing abroad or even significantly into its own stock markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This strategy aims to [[state_control_and_limitations_on_private_savings_in_China | supersaturate the capital environment]] for Chinese firms, especially state-owned enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This "captured capital" is then directed to industries deemed important by the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

[[chinas_capital_intensive_investment_model | This investment-driven approach]] has been fundamental to China's economic model, supporting full employment, extensive infrastructure development, and explosive growth over the last 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. However, [[chinas_capital_intensive_investment_model | Chinese returns on capital are among the worst globally]], with recent data suggesting they may even be negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

China possesses a vast domestic money supply, which is roughly double that of the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Unlike the shrinking US money supply, China's has not significantly contracted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The majority of China's currency is not traded internationally, with most international transactions occurring in Hong Kong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Therefore, China has the capacity to fund its AI initiatives without external financial assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Objectives of the Restrictions

The true value of American venture capital and private equity for China lies in the access they provide to American firms and, crucially, the American market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. China currently lacks significant cutting-edge technical development capabilities and the workforce to translate new ideas into manufacturing systems without American support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

The Biden Administration's restrictions aim to "slam that door" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, preventing China from leveraging American capital, know-how, and connections to displace American companies in the global market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. These measures are part of an increasingly strict series of restrictions on all things Chinese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Impact and Global Alignment

Despite over a trillion dollars in subsidies, China has struggled to advance in mid-to-high-end semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. With these new restrictions, it is uncertain if China can even maintain its current position in semiconductors, as many operationalization pathways are now closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

These tech sanctions are still in their early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The US consumer market, which is over three times the size of China's, is crucial for China to maintain its employment and tax systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Without access to this market, China faces significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

In terms of [[global_alignments_in_tech_restrictions_against_china | global alignment on tech sanctions]], Japan, the Netherlands, and the UK are already on board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Taiwan and South Korea are in the process of aligning with these restrictions as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

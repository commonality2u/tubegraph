The [[biden_administrations_plan_for_gaza | Biden Administration]] has publicly committed to constructing a floating dock to facilitate humanitarian aid deliveries to the Gaza territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This initiative aims to provide at least 2 million meals per day, fulfilling approximately one-third of the region's food demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## The Dire Situation in Gaza

Gaza is characterized as an "open-air prison camp" that is entirely dependent on external aid for survival, as it cannot produce its own food or energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Following the October Hamas attacks on [[israels_defense_and_political_response | Israel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, [[israels_defense_and_political_response | Israel's]] counter-effort to eliminate Hamas has resulted in the destruction of an estimated two-thirds of Gaza's housing stock and significant infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

The conflict has led to about 35,000 deaths among the Gaza population, exceeding 1% of its pre-war civilian population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. With an anticipated assault on the southern part of the strip, particularly Rafa, casualties are expected to at least double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This makes it the highest-casualty conflict in recent years outside of Sub-Saharan Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Challenges of Aid Delivery and US Military Involvement

Despite the urgent need, aid delivery to Gaza faces significant obstacles. [[israels_defense_and_political_response | Israel]] has largely blockaded entrances due to the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The United Nations is unable to operate effectively in Gaza during wartime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, leaving the [[us_military_involvement_and_middle_eastern_politics | US military]] as the only entity capable of managing such a large-scale operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

The plan for the floating dock necessitates a substantial [[us_military_involvement_and_middle_eastern_politics | US military presence]] to:
*   Deliver aid via small boats to the dock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   Put "boots on the ground" in Gaza to establish a truck distribution system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

The scale of this operation is "much larger" than the Berlin airlift, where aid could simply be dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This could result in a larger [[us_military_involvement_and_middle_eastern_politics | US military]] footprint in and around Gaza than in the entire rest of the Middle East combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. A key concern is the continued activity of Hamas in the region, which is expected to lead to attacks on [[us_military_involvement_and_middle_eastern_politics | US forces]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

While a floating dock allows for a relatively quick withdrawal of military personnel if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, it still establishes a significant military presence in an area with "absolutely no strategic value to the United States" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## US-Israel Relations and Regional Dynamics

The dock initiative poses a significant challenge to [[usisrael_relations | US-Israel relations]]. The [[biden_administrations_plan_for_gaza | Biden Administration's]] commitment to this plan is perceived by [[israels_defense_and_political_response | Israel]] as conflicting with their national security interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Even left-wing factions in [[israels_defense_and_political_response | Israel]] would likely oppose this measure, as it "cuts to the core of Israeli survivability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. There is broad support within [[israels_defense_and_political_response | Israel]] for the military operation in Gaza, despite civilian casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

The [[biden_administrations_plan_for_gaza | Biden Administration]] is aware of [[israels_defense_and_political_response | Israel's]] stance, and the Joint Chiefs likely informed the cabinet of the implications of deploying [[us_military_involvement_and_middle_eastern_politics | US military]] personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This move suggests the United States may be preparing to "breach" its relationship with [[israels_defense_and_political_response | Israel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

> "There is no way that Israel will be secure so long as Hamas exists, and I don't see a way to destroy Hamas without destroying Gaza... the United States is attempting to find a third way. It won't work." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>

Such a shift could lead to a broader [[us_military_involvement_and_middle_eastern_politics | US pull-out]] from the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, potentially leaving existing regional alliances, including [[egypts_stance_on_the_gaza_conflict | Jordan]], [[egypts_stance_on_the_gaza_conflict | Egypt]], Morocco, Tunisia, the UAE, and potentially Saudi Arabia, to fend for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

If the US disengages from its traditional partners, the only viable alternative for influence in the region would be a partnership with Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Recent renewed diplomatic connections between the [[biden_administrations_plan_for_gaza | Biden Administration]] and Turkey's ErdoÄŸan administration suggest this possibility, as Turkey possesses the most powerful military in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. This has the potential to be a "game-changing" development for the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

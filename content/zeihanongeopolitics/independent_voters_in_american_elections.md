## Definition and Demographics
For the last 30 years, most elections in the United States, especially at the presidential level, have been decided by Americans who identify as [[role_of_independents_in_us_politics | independent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. While roughly 30% of the American population self-identifies as Democrats and 30% as Republicans, the 40% in the middle call themselves [[role_of_independents_in_us_politics | Independents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. However, over three-quarters of this group will vote for one party or the other almost all the time, more than 90% of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This means only a thin sliver of 5 to 10% of voters has historically been the [[impact_of_independents_in_elections | balance of power]] within the American political system for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Historical Impact on Elections
This crucial group of [[role_of_independents_in_us_politics | Independents]] has influenced presidential outcomes, putting in:
*   Obama twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>
*   W. Bush twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>
*   Biden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
*   Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>
They also played a role in kicking Trump out of office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Independent Voter Behavior
[[role_of_independents_in_us_politics | Independents]] tend to be fickle, often switching sides every two or three elections due to "buyer's remorse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### The 2022 Midterms
Leading up to the 2022 midterms, Donald Trump spent two years telling [[role_of_independents_in_us_politics | Independents]] their votes did not matter, suggesting everything should be decided at the primary level rather than the general election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The response from America's true [[role_of_independents_in_us_politics | Independents]] was notable: in all but one of the races Donald Trump endorsed, the Democrats won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This unexpected outcome transformed what was anticipated to be a "red wave" in the midterms into, at best, a "red fizzle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. It took "really pissing them off to their core" for [[role_of_independents_in_us_politics | Independents]] to show up twice and vote the same way twice in a row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### The 2024 Election
Based on Trump's unchanged rhetoric, it was anticipated that [[role_of_independents_in_us_politics | Independents]] would vote in 2024 as they did in 2020 and 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   A 50/50 split among [[role_of_independents_in_us_politics | Independents]] would give an advantage to Democrats, though Republicans would still have possible paths to victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   If [[role_of_independents_in_us_politics | Independents]] broke strongly for Democrats, similar to 2022, it would create a map where Republicans would have very little chance of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

Preliminary exit poll data and final results from most states, including Arizona and Nevada, suggest that the prediction regarding [[role_of_independents_in_us_politics | Independents]] largely held true: they broke very strongly against Trump for the third election in a row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. However, other demographic groups voted differently, leading to a shift in the overall election outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

Despite [[role_of_independents_in_us_politics | Independents]] consistently voting against Trump, a significant factor in the 2024 election was a more than 10% drop in voter participation compared to 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This suggests that Trump no longer has the same motivating factor, either for or against him, as he once did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## Broader Political Context
The shift in voter behavior indicates that the United States is in a period of [[political_realignment_in_the_united_states | political realignment]], with party loyalties visibly shifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. The election results point to the potential end of what has been understood as the Democratic Party's alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Historically, the Democratic alliance relied on three pillars:
1.  Coastal, primarily white, college-educated elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>
2.  Minorities of all types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>
3.  Organized labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>

However, many of these pillars showed significant breaks in the 2024 election:
*   Unmarried women shifted to Trump by 5 points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   Youth (18-29 year olds) broke towards Trump by 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   Black men shifted to Trump by 7% more than before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   Non-white college graduates shifted by 9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   Asians shifted by 11% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   Lower-income individuals shifted by 12% for Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   Latinos shifted by 17%, with Latino men specifically shifting by 22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

These shifts indicate that organized labor is now, at best, a swing vote, with over half voting for Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Furthermore, [[changing_demographics_and_their_political_impact | Hispanics]], the fastest-growing demographic largely due to immigration, are the group most opposed to migration in any form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Donald Trump's focus on the southern border resonated strongly with this group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. The loss of support from [[changing_demographics_and_their_political_impact | Hispanics]] and organized labor means that the Democratic alliance, if reduced to just "white Coastal educated Elites," would not be able to win federal elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. This suggests that a new party may be emerging, although it is currently unclear if the alignment that brought Trump to power for a second term is a permanent feature of MAGA, which is described as something new and distinct from the traditional Republican Alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

Ukraine is currently preparing for a major offensive, anticipated to take place in a couple of months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This [[potential_ukrainian_counteroffensive | potential Ukrainian counteroffensive]] involves significant strategic changes and the shaping of the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Preparations for the Offensive

The preparations include:
*   **F-16s:** Ukraine is preparing to receive a substantial number of F-16 fighter jets from NATO countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   **Arms Packages:** This comes after receiving significant arms packages from both Europe and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

The objective of these preparations is to allow the new aircraft to operate in a less contested environment, enabling Ukraine to use its artillery effectively against concentrated Russian forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Recent Aggression and Battlefield Shaping

In recent weeks, Ukraine has become notably more aggressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>:
*   **Kharkiv:** The Russian assault on Kharkiv in the Northeast has been turned into a "killing ground" for Russian troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Southern Counter-assaults:** Ukraine has increased the pace of its [[ukrainian_counteroffensive_in_the_war | counter-assaults]] south of the Nea River, where Russians have reportedly suffered casualty ratios as high as 20:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

These ground actions are considered secondary to the broader [[ukrainian_military_strategy_and_territorial_gains | military strategy]] of shaping the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Air Defense Suppression

A critical component of Ukraine's strategy is the use of mid-range rockets and missiles to target Russian aviation assets deep within Russia, sometimes as far as 500 miles from the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Ukraine is also actively targeting anti-aircraft batteries, specifically the S-300s and the more advanced S-400s, throughout the Crimean Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

> "The S-400s are considered the best in the world, and in at least the last two weeks the Ukrainians have taken out at least four batteries, one of which had only been up and running for a few days at the point where it was taken out." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>

The aim is to deny Russia as much air defense as possible before the F-16s arrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. If Ukraine can establish regional or even temporary local air superiority, they can leverage NATO-provided training and equipment from previous years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Ukraine has also improved at taking out strategic radar systems deep within Russian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Lessons from Past Counter-offensives

Previous [[ukrainian_counteroffensive_plans | Ukrainian counteroffensives]] in 2022 and early 2023 faced different battlefield conditions:
*   **2022-2023:** Russian forces had not significantly fortified their positions, allowing Ukrainian forces to achieve breakthroughs, inflict heavy casualties, and force retreats from areas like Kherson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Later Stages:** As the war progressed, [[russian_military_strategies_and_advancements_in_ukraine | Russia]] began laying extensive minefields and building multi-layered defenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

NATO training prepared Ukrainian forces for combined arms operations, integrating infantry, mounted infantry, tanks, helicopters, missiles, and aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. However, Ukraine lacked the necessary air power, which allowed Russian artillery to call in strikes, bogging down subsequent [[strategic_changes_in_ukrainian_military_tactics | counter-offensive efforts]] and resulting in minimal gains despite significant casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Future Objectives and Potential Outcomes

The current [[ukrainian_counteroffensive_strategy | Ukrainian counteroffensive strategy]] is to prepare the battlefield to overcome the previous air power deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. If F-16s arrive as expected in about a month, Ukraine might achieve regional air superiority over most of the Crimean Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

This would facilitate cutting the remaining infrastructure links between Russia and the southern front, specifically the Kerch Bridge and a supplementary rail system through occupied southern Ukraine, both of which are already within artillery range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

The overarching goal of this [[potential_ukrainian_ground_assault_strategies | Ukrainian ground assault strategy]] is to:
*   Utilize superior speed, innovation, and reach to disrupt Russian logistical capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   Isolate large pockets of Russian troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   Generate political humiliation that could trigger a Russian climb-down or even government collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

Historically, about half of Russian government collapses have followed major military defeats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. While the capture of Crimea would not end the entire war, as Russian logistics in Eastern Ukraine's Donbas region are robust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, it could mark a potential "Battle of this war that might fall into that category" of a decisive defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. The success of this offensive hinges on Ukraine's continued adeptness, particularly with the F-16s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

Recent Ukrainian attacks on Russian ammunition depots signal a potential shift in the war's tempo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. In late September, Ukraine successfully struck multiple major arm depots within Russian territory, some located hundreds of miles from the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Key Incidents and Scale
The targeted locations include Kodor, Tow Rope, and Tick Hor Retes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. One of these explosions was of such magnitude that it registered on seismic monitoring stations a thousand miles away, indicating a kiloton-range blast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Russian Ammunition Handling and Vulnerability
Russian military logistics and storage methods contribute to the severity of these explosions. Unlike standard practices, Russians do not use forklifts, crates, or pallets for ammunition storage; instead, items are kept in boxes and moved by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This less organized approach means that when something goes wrong, the resulting explosions are often catastrophic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## New Ukrainian Weaponry
Ukraine has introduced a new weapon system, described as a "drone missile" named "Lenisa," which is slightly less than a cruise missile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. While its range is limited to no more than 300 miles—shorter than some other Ukrainian drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>—it flies much faster, is harder to intercept, and carries a significantly heavier payload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Warheads for these new missiles are estimated to be two to five times larger than previous drones, which typically carried only about 75 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. The attack on Toit specifically involved at least a hundred of these new systems, indicating they are being manufactured and deployed in large numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## [[consequences_for_russian_logistics_and_transport | Russian Rail Vulnerability]]
Russia primarily relies on rail for moving cargo over long distances, with 90% of goods, including military supplies, transported by train <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. The final mile of delivery is often handled manually or by civilian vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This dependence creates significant vulnerabilities. In the attack on Tiaret, a train was apparently unloading ammunition at the time of the strike, leading to the destruction of the entire depot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

This incident suggests that Ukraine may have developed the capability to track Russian rail movements in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This capability might stem from the capture of a rail depot at Suda in the KKK Province, which could allow Ukraine to tap into or hack the Russian rail network, providing schedules and locations of locomotives and their cargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. If Ukraine can identify trains carrying explosive materials heading to ammunition warehouses, these locations become prime targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## Strategic Implications
With improved intelligence on the rail system and the deployment of faster, more lethal drone missiles, Ukraine's logical next step in targeting is Russia's power generation and distribution system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Given that two-thirds of Russia's locomotives are electric, disrupting the electricity supply would cripple the entire Russian transport system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Early signs of this strategy may have been observed in [[impact_on_russian_military_operations_in_crimea | Ukrainian drone attacks on power centers in Crimea]], which felt like test runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

Such attacks are expected to increase within 150 miles of the Ukrainian border to the north, northeast, and east <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The [[strategic_implications_of_russian_military_logistics_disruption | impact of logistical and infrastructure damages on Russian forces]] is already evident, with Russian counter-offensives in places like Kursk stalling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a> and assaults in eastern Ukraine ceasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. For instance, the Russian advance towards the Ukrainian rail network at Barov, crucial for Ukrainian force movement, halted just miles short, likely due to these disruptive attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

These developments pose a severe threat to Russia's ability to supply its front lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Russia's military strategy relies on overwhelming numbers of personnel and shells, which is unsustainable without a robust rail network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Ukraine's ability to target the heart of this network could have significant short, medium, and long-term consequences for Russian military operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

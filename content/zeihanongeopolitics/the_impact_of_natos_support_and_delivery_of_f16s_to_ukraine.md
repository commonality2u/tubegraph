Ukraine is preparing for a major offensive, likely several months away, by actively preparing the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This preparation includes receiving a large allotment of F-16s from [[NATO's task force in the Baltic and its implications | NATO]] countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This comes on the heels of significant arms packages from Europe and the [[US military support and equipment transfer to Ukraine | United States]], which are enabling Ukraine to shape the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Battlefield Preparation and Air Superiority

In recent weeks, Ukrainian forces have become more aggressive, turning the Russian assault on Kharkiv into a "killing ground" and increasing counter-assaults south of the Dnipro River, where Russians have suffered 20-to-1 casualty ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. A key military strategy involves using mid-range rockets and missiles to target Russian aviation assets deep within Russia (up to 500 miles from the border) and throughout the Crimean Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Specifically, Ukraine is targeting S-300 and S-400 anti-aircraft batteries, considered among the best in the world; at least four S-400 batteries have been taken out in the last two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

The objective of these strikes is to deny Russia as much air defense as possible before the F-16s arrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. If Ukraine can establish regional or even temporary local air superiority, they can effectively utilize the training and equipment provided by the [[NATO's task force in the Baltic and its implications | NATO]] alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Lessons from Previous Counter-Offensives

During the initial counter-offensives in 2022 and early 2023, Russian forces had not significantly fortified their positions, allowing Ukraine to inflict massive casualties and cause retreats in areas like Kherson or near Kyiv <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. However, as the war progressed, Russia established multi-layered defenses, including extensive minefields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

[[NATO's task force in the Baltic and its implications | NATO]] training equipped Ukrainian forces with combined arms tactics, integrating infantry, mounted infantry, tanks, helicopters, missiles, and aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Despite this training, Ukraine lacked the necessary air power for effective combined arms operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This allowed Russia to call in artillery strikes due to their ability to deny Ukraine control of the skies, leading to bogged-down counter-offensives and minimal gains despite significant casualties and equipment losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Anticipated Impact of F-16s

Ukraine's current efforts aim to prepare the battlefield to prevent a repeat of past air power deficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The goal is for the arriving F-16s to operate in a less contested environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. If successful, Ukraine would be able to concentrate forces and strike Russian positions with artillery, reversing the previous dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

Ukraine has demonstrated increasing proficiency in taking out strategic radar systems deep within Russian territory even without significant air power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. When the F-16s begin to arrive in about a month, Ukraine could potentially achieve regional air superiority over most of the Crimean Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This would facilitate cutting off remaining infrastructure links from Russia proper to the southern front, specifically the already damaged Kerch Bridge and a supplementary rail system through occupied southern Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

The broader aim is for Ukraine to leverage superior speed, innovation, and reach to disrupt Russian logistical capacities, isolate large pockets of troops, and create a "political humiliation" for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Historically, about half of Russian government collapses have followed major military defeats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. While a complete end to the war is not expected even with the potential capture of Crimea, as Russian logistics in Donbas are robust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, the anticipated battles later this year, particularly in Crimea, could be decisive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. The success of this strategy hinges on Ukrainian forces adapting effectively to the F-16s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

Ukraine is reportedly preparing for a major offensive, likely months away, by focusing on preparing the battlefield through strategic actions against Russian air defense systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This preparation coincides with the anticipated arrival of F-16 fighter jets from NATO countries and significant arms packages from Europe and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Current Preparations and Battlefield Shaping

In recent weeks, Ukrainian forces have significantly escalated their aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. While their defense of the Russian assault on Kharkiv and counter-assaults south of the Dnipro River have inflicted heavy casualties on Russian troops—sometimes at a 20:1 ratio—these actions are considered secondary to the larger [[strategic_changes_in_ukrainian_military_tactics | military strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

The primary focus has been on:
*   **Targeting Russian Aviation Assets**: Utilizing mid-range rockets and missiles to strike Russian aviation assets deep within Russia, in some instances up to 500 miles from the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Neutralizing Anti-Aircraft Batteries**: Actively targeting anti-aircraft batteries throughout the Crimean Peninsula, specifically the S-300s and the more advanced S-400s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The S-400s are considered among the best in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. In a two-week period, Ukrainians reportedly destroyed at least four S-400 batteries, one of which had only been operational for a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Eliminating Strategic Radar Systems**: Ukrainians have also improved their ability to destroy strategic radar systems deep within Russian territory, even without their own air power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Strategic Objectives

The overarching goal of these actions is to deny Russia as much air defense capability as possible before the F-16s arrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. If Ukraine can establish regional or even temporary local air superiority, they will be able to effectively utilize the combined arms training and equipment provided by NATO over the past one to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Lessons from Past Counteroffensives

During the first waves of [[ukrainian_counteroffensive in the war | counteroffensives]] in 2022 and early 2023, while Russia had not yet extensively fortified positions, Ukraine's advances were hampered by a critical lack of air power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Although NATO training had equipped Ukrainian forces for combined arms operations (infantry, mounted infantry, tanks, helicopters, missiles, aircraft), they lacked the necessary air support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This allowed Russian forces to call in artillery strikes and effectively deny the Ukrainians control of the skies, leading to stalled advances and minimal gains despite significant casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Impact of Achieving Air Superiority

By preparing the battlefield to mitigate the air power problem, the new aircraft will be able to operate in a less contested environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This will enable Ukraine to:
*   **Counter Russian Force Concentration**: Return artillery fire on Russian force concentrations, rather than the other way around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Disrupt Logistics in Crimea**: If regional air superiority is achieved over most of the Crimean Peninsula, it will become easier to cut the remaining infrastructure links from Russia into the southern front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The two primary links are the already damaged Kerch Bridge and a supplementary rail system through occupied southern Ukraine, which is already within artillery range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Broader Strategic Goals

The ultimate goal of Ukraine's [[ukrainian_military_strategy_and_offensive_preparations | military strategy]] is to leverage superior speed, innovation, and reach to dismantle Russian logistical capacities, isolate large pockets of troops, and create the kind of political humiliation that has historically led to Russian government climb-downs or even collapses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. While the outcome is not guaranteed, the current battlefield preparation suggests a move towards decisive conflicts later in the year, particularly in Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This strategy hinges on the Ukrainian forces proving as adept with the F-16s as they have been with other equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

> Historically, roughly half of all Russian government collapses have been triggered by major military defeats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. The potential Battle for Crimea could be the first engagement in the current war to fall into this category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

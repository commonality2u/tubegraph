This article explores the likelihood of [[Vladimir Putins involvement and potential motive | Vladimir Putin's]] removal or assassination, its potential impact on the ongoing war, and the broader implications for [[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russia's future]], as discussed by Peter Zeihan.

## Context: Russia's Geopolitical and Demographic Imperatives

To understand the situation regarding [[Vladimir Putins involvement and potential motive | Putin]], it's essential to consider the underlying reasons for [[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russia's]] current war strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

### Geographic Vulnerabilities and Strategic Expansion
[[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russian]] territory is characterized by flat, open land that is difficult to defend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Historically, [[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russia]] has sought to expand beyond these plains to reach geographical "funnel points" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. These points, with natural barriers on either side and a flat area in the middle, allow for troop concentration to block access and defend lands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:56]</a>.

After the collapse of the Soviet system in 1992, [[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russia]] lost control of most of these crucial access points, retaining only two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The Kremlin's actions since 1982, predating [[Vladimir Putins involvement and potential motive | Putin]], have been focused on re-establishing positions on or near these blocking points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Examples include the Transnistria occupation, the Georgian War, Crimea, the Kazakh intervention, and involvement in the Karabakh conflict, all aimed at "plugging those gaps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Dire Demographic Situation
[[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russia]] faces one of the world's worst demographic situations, arguably surpassed only by Ukraine since the war began, and possibly China due to recent data changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The [[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russian]] demographic pyramid shows significant "gouges" from past traumas such as world wars, collectivization, and mismanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

The most severe impact came from the post-Soviet collapse in the 1990s, when the death rate doubled and the birth rate halved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. More recently, conservative [[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russian]] statistics indicate that 1.3 million [[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russians]] under 35 have fled the country since the war began, mostly young men avoiding the draft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The number of men who fled is roughly two to three times the number who answered the draft summons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## The "Last Chance" Doctrine and the Intelligence Cadre

The confluence of these factors—geopolitical vulnerability and demographic decline—explains the urgency of [[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russia's]] current actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### The Intelligence Services' Coup and Enduring Influence
In 1982, a coup in the Soviet Union saw the intelligence services, led by Yuri Andropov, take control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This clique, which included Gorbachev and, at a lower level, [[Vladimir Putins governance style and background | Putin]] himself, purged the Soviet decision-making apparatus of anyone not associated with intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. They took over because they were the only ones with an accurate view of the [[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russian]] system, particularly economically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

### The Shrinking Pool of Expertise
Due to the demographic collapse and the deterioration of the [[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russian]] educational system (meaningful broad-spectrum technical education above high school ended around 1986), the pool of people under 35 who could be drafted is very limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This is the last generation of fighting men [[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russia]] has, with about 8 million men in their 20s, and over a million already lost to war or flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

Crucially, the youngest cadre of people with a full suite of technical training turns 60 this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. These are the individuals who maintain critical infrastructure like railways, the nuclear missile fleet, the military, and the energy complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. The [[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russian]] system is losing its capacity to maintain itself, a problem previously masked by commodities export revenue used to hire foreigners, who are now gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

This means that the entire cadre of intelligence services survivors educated before 1986 now numbers fewer than 130 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Simple mortality is eliminating the [[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russian government's]] capacity to function, especially at the top levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### Shared Vision and Putin's Consolidation of Power
The current [[Vladimir Putins involvement and potential motive | Russian]] leadership views the war as existential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. They believe that if they do not gain control of the geographic gaps soon, [[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russia]] will lose the capacity to defend itself against future aggressors, a belief that is considered accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. This is their "last chance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

All members of this "130 people" cadre view the world through the same lens, having been part of the intelligence services clique formed during the 1982 coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. [[Vladimir Putins governance style and background | Putin]] has spent 23 years weeding out anyone with different views or who might challenge him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Potential Scenarios for Putin's Removal

Given the unified vision of the leadership, even if [[Vladimir Putins involvement and potential motive | Putin]] were removed, the remaining 129 individuals would likely continue to pursue the general vision, as they believe it is essential for [[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russia's]] survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

### Trigger for an Uprising
An end to the war due to internal Moscow politics would likely require the Ukrainians to decisively defeat the [[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russian]] military, leading to humiliation visible within Moscow itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. If this occurs, the probability of a general uprising in Moscow—not necessarily across all of [[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russia]]—increases dramatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

[[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russia]] is held together by occupation, intelligence penetration, and fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. If the military is perceived as "toothless" or incompetent, rebellions could break out throughout the [[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russian]] system, with some parts of [[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russia]] potentially slipping away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. If an uprising in Moscow occurs, similar to those after the Russo-Japanese War (1905) or World War I, people could march on the Kremlin, leading to the removal of [[Vladimir Putins involvement and potential motive | Putin]] and his clique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

### Post-Putin Implications
Even if [[Vladimir Putins involvement and potential motive | Putin]] is removed, the war might not end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Even figures like Navalny, who campaign for democracy, have indicated broad acceptance of the war, viewing Ukraine as [[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russian]] territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Therefore, a democratic [[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russia]] might still choose to prosecute the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

However, a catastrophic military defeat leading to the fall of the government would likely result in years for any post-[[Vladimir Putins involvement and potential motive | Putin]] government to find its footing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. During this period, [[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russia's]] economic situation would deteriorate further, and its demographic situation would become "completely irrecoverable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

## No "Off-Ramp" for the Current Regime
The idea of an "off-ramp" for [[Vladimir Putins involvement and potential motive | Putin]] and the [[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russian]] government—a way for the war to end without complete defeat for either side—is considered impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

[[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russia]] has paid the price for a major war without gaining benefits, and is in a worse strategic position than when it started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. The [[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russians]] are "all in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

Furthermore, any meaningful peace would necessitate reparations and an admission of guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. The entire [[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russian]] upper leadership could easily be implicated due to thousands of documented war crimes, which the [[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russians]] have even celebrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. Even if the world and Ukraine were willing to settle without a reckoning, [[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russia]] would not regain the pre-war investment crucial for its system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. Given the demographic decay and war losses, this would be a blow from which the [[Strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia | Russian]] system would not recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

Therefore, [[Vladimir Putins involvement and potential motive | Putin]] and the current leadership are in this "to the end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. The question is only whether that end comes in years or decades, but it will certainly be within this century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

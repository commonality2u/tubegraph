The role of [[independent_voters_in_american_elections | independents]] is crucial in American elections, particularly concerning their influence on presidential outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Defining "True Independents"

The term "independents" in this context does not refer to the 30% to 40% of Americans who are not registered as Republican or Democrat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. A large majority of these individuals vote consistently with one party or the other about 90% of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Instead, "true independents" are the approximately 10% of "vote splitters" in the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This specific group has historically decided every American election in modern history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Perceptions of Candidates by Independents

These true [[independent_voters_in_american_elections | independents]] are reported to be dissatisfied with both major candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### Impact of [[Impact of Donald Trump on midterm elections | Donald Trump]] on Independents

[[Impact of Donald Trump on midterm elections | Donald Trump]]'s consistent assertion that the 2020 election was stolen, despite counter-evidence from his own administration officials, is seen as a threat to [[independent_voters_in_american_elections | independent]] voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. His argument that the general election does not matter, and everything should be decided in primaries, impacts [[independent_voters_in_american_elections | independents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. While [[Impact of Donald Trump on the Republican Coalition | Trump]] performs well in primaries due to the strong turnout of the "Maga crowd," this philosophy effectively diminishes the vote of an [[independent_voters_in_american_elections | independent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## The Strategic Importance of Independent Voters

Given that there are more registered Democrats than Republicans, Joe Biden does not necessarily need to win the [[independent_voters_in_american_elections | independent]] vote to secure a victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. If [[independent_voters_in_american_elections | independents]] are alienated by both candidates and choose not to vote, this non-participation effectively results in a victory for Biden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. This strategic dynamic suggests that the election remains in Biden's favor as long as he is alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

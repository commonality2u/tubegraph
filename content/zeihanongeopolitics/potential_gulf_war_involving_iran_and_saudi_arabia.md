A significant shift in circumstances has led to a reassessment of the likelihood of a severe oil price crash due to a conflict in the [[middle_east_geopolitics_and_oil_reliance | Middle East]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Previously, concerns about [[irans_potential_involvement | Iran]] closing the Strait of Hormuz and oil prices soaring were dismissed, as [[irans_potential_involvement | Iran's]] own crude exports rely on that strait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Historical Context of "The Next Gulf War"

The concept of a "Next Gulf War" was outlined approximately a decade ago, as one of three "Wars of the deglobalization period" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. These conflicts are predicted to emerge as the [[us_military_involvement_and_middle_eastern_politics | US steps back]] from global security roles, leading nations to take matters into their own hands out of opportunity or desperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

The "Next Gulf War" specifically describes a conflict where [[iran_saudi_arabia_rivalry | Iran and Saudi Arabia]] engage in direct hostilities due to issues with energy export reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. In this scenario, between 10 to 12 million barrels of crude oil could be at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Current Geopolitical Shifts

Recent developments, particularly the [[iranian_attack_on_israel | Iranian attack on Israel]] with hundreds of missiles a few weeks prior, have prompted a reassessment of this potential conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Israel has clearly stated its intention to retaliate, explicitly shortlisting [[irans_potential_involvement | Iran's oil sector]] as a potential target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### Targeting [[irans_potential_involvement | Iran's]] Oil Exports

*   **Kharg Island**: This island is identified as the primary target for any Israeli strike. It is the only significant export point for Iranian crude, with subsea infrastructure connecting it to the mainland and offshore loading platforms situated nearby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Israeli Capabilities**: Israel has demonstrated its ability to neutralize Iranian air defense systems, as seen in April when it took out defenses around [[irans_potential_involvement | Iran's]] nuclear program in Isfahan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. A strike on Kharg Island's air defenses would be comparatively simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Impact**: An Israeli attack, potentially involving just a couple of sorties lasting about an hour, could devastate [[irans_potential_involvement | Iran's]] entire oil export capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Escalation Scenario: [[iran_saudi_arabia_rivalry | Iran]] vs. [[iran_saudi_arabia_rivalry | Saudi Arabia]]

Should [[irans_potential_involvement | Iran's]] oil exports be crippled, the country might become desperate and launch an attack against [[iran_saudi_arabia_rivalry | Saudi Arabia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

Two main attack methods are envisioned:
1.  **Military Invasion**: A land invasion through southern Iraq (which is predominantly Shia and pro-Iranian) and Kuwait, aiming for Saudi oil fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The ease of such an invasion would depend on whether [[us_military_involvement_and_middle_eastern_politics | other countries]], like the [[potential_security_allies_for_saudi_arabia | United States]], become involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
2.  **Missile Strikes**: [[irans_potential_involvement | Iran]] possesses sufficient missiles to target oil export and processing facilities on the western side of the Persian Gulf, particularly in [[iran_saudi_arabia_rivalry | Saudi Arabia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Most of [[iran_saudi_arabia_rivalry | Saudi Arabia's]] crude originates from the Ghawar region near the coast, with loading platforms also situated on the Gulf Coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Potential [[impact_of_conflict_on_global_oil_prices | Impact on Global Oil Prices]]

*   **Iranian Output Loss**: While the loss of [[irans_potential_involvement | Iran's]] approximately 1 million barrels per day (bpd) would not be catastrophic on its own due to existing sanctions and mismanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Gulf State Involvement**: If other Gulf States, especially [[iran_saudi_arabia_rivalry | Saudi Arabia]], are affected, the reduction could escalate to 10 million bpd or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Wider Regional Conflict**: Including oil from Iraq, the UAE, or Kuwait, which would be in the path of such a conflict, the potential daily loss could reach 20 million barrels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This scale of disruption could drive [[impact_of_conflict_on_global_oil_prices | oil prices above $300]] per barrel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## Differentiated Economic Outcomes

A conflict of this magnitude would shatter the current single global oil price system, leading to varied economic consequences for different regions and countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### The [[ussaudi_arabia_relations_and_future_outlook | United States]]

*   **Domestic Market**: A populist US president has the authority to end American crude oil exports, which currently amount to several million bpd due to the Shale Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Price Disparity**: Halting exports would create a super-saturated market within the US, potentially capping domestic prices at $60-$70 per barrel, while simultaneously denying the rest of the world additional supply, pushing global prices higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   **Economic Impact**: This would allow the [[ussaudi_arabia_relations_and_future_outlook | United States]] to "skate right on" while the rest of the world faces a global depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **California Exception**: California would be uniquely impacted. Without pipeline connections to major US oil fields and due to state regulations hindering domestic production, it imports most of its crude from the Persian Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This could lead to gasoline prices of $10 per gallon, causing a significant economic schism within the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### China

*   China would suffer the most significantly, as it is the largest consumer of crude from [[iran_saudi_arabia_rivalry | Saudi Arabia]], the UAE, Kuwait, and [[irans_potential_involvement | Iran]]â€”all sources that would be severely jeopardized or eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### Oil Producers in the Persian Gulf

*   Not all producers in the Persian Gulf would suffer equally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Bypass Pipelines**: [[iran_saudi_arabia_rivalry | Saudi Arabia]] and the UAE have built bypass pipelines that avoid the Strait of Hormuz entirely, allowing 5 to 6.5 million bpd to still be exported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Financial Position**: If oil prices triple while exports are halved (or less), countries like [[iran_saudi_arabia_rivalry | Saudi Arabia]] could find themselves in a superior financial position, assuming they are not conquered by [[irans_potential_involvement | Iran]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

The probability of this [[geopolitical_tensions_in_the_middle_east | geopolitical tension]] escalating into a full-blown conflict is estimated to be between 1 in 4 and 1 in 3 within the next few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

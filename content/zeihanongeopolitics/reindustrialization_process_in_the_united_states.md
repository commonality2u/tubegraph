The United States is currently undergoing what is described as the "greatest re-industrialization process" in its history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This involves building out industrial infrastructure, factories, refineries, pipelines, and roads at a pace faster than during World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This significant build-out is influenced by a combination of long-standing factors and recent global events.

## Legacy Factors Supporting Reindustrialization

### Highly Skilled Labor Force
The United States possesses the most highly skilled labor force globally by a significant margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. While smaller countries like Singapore might have higher overall education levels, the sheer size of the US workforce (330 million people compared to Singapore's 5 million) gives it an unparalleled capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Similarly, while German or French labor might show slightly higher hourly productivity, the US labor force is four to six times larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This means there are few industrial undertakings the United States cannot accomplish if it commits to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

Historically, particularly since 1945 and especially after 1991, the US adopted [[historical_context_of_american_globalization_policies | globalization policies]] that focused on extremely high-value-added production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This strategy involved offshoring manufacturing of common goods, such as underwear, first to Mexico and then to China and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Instead, the US prioritized designing complex items like computers, space stations, and microchips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Much of the actual manufacturing of these high-tech goods was not done domestically, as it was not considered sufficiently high-value-added for the American workforce's skill set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### [[Impact of the Shale Revolution on US industry | Shale Revolution]]
The [[Impact of the Shale Revolution on US industry | Shale Revolution]] has made the United States abundant in natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Natural gas is not only a power fuel but also a crucial input for chemical components used in various manufacturing processes, from electrical work to consumer goods like diapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

The US became net independent in natural gas approximately 10 years ago, and net oil independent shortly after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Despite minor setbacks during COVID-19, the country has returned to energy independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. One of the initial industrial build-outs encouraged by the [[Impact of the Shale Revolution on US industry | Shale Revolution]] was in chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. As a result, the US is now the world's largest producer of precursor materials for petrochemicals globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. These materials are now being utilized for the next phase of heavy manufacturing domestically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Current Catalysts for Reshoring

### [[Effects of COVID on US supply chains and manufacturing | COVID-19 Impact]]
The [[Effects of COVID on US supply chains and manufacturing | COVID-19 pandemic]] exposed the vulnerabilities of international supply chains, particularly due to China's central role in global manufacturing and its subsequent lockdown policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This revelation prompted a realization that for essential goods, domestic production was necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. During the pandemic, total industrial construction spending in the US doubled, surpassing the 50-year average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### [[Role of the Inflation Reduction Act in reshoring and industrial buildout | Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)]]
In the last two years, the passage of the [[Role of the Inflation Reduction Act in reshoring and industrial buildout | Inflation Reduction Act]] (IRA) has further accelerated this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. The IRA, which involves more than just green initiatives, aims to overhaul the power system and [[Role of the Inflation Reduction Act in reshoring and industrial buildout | reshore production]] for all components of the power system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. It also incorporates elements similar to NAFTA 2.0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The IRA has allocated roughly a trillion dollars into the system to facilitate this industrial build-out, effectively doubling construction spending again from already record levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Outlook

While this reindustrialization may lead to some short-to-midterm inflation due to the doubling of the industrial plant's size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, the long-term benefits are substantial. In a few years, the US is projected to have a localized supply chain system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This system will be:
*   Employed by locals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   Serving local customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   Utilizing less energy and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   Having fewer production steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   Largely immune to international shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

This [[economic_restructuring_in_post_globalized_world | economic restructuring]] is viewed as a highly positive development for the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

On October 7th, Hamas, described as a political terror group controlling the southern enclave of Gaza, launched a significant attack into Israel proper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This event marked a major escalation in the [[israel_and_hamas_conflict_overview | Israel and Hamas conflict overview]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Details of the Assault
The attack commenced in the early hours of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Hamas forces reportedly demolished parts of the border, engaged in land, sea, and paraglider attacks, and launched thousands of missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The assault also involved the kidnapping of at least several dozen civilians and a handful of soldiers, who were taken back to Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Israeli Response
In response to the attacks, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel, declared war on Hamas, indicating that military operations were forthcoming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This declaration signals a significant shift in [[israels_defense_and_political_response | Israel's defense and political response]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Geopolitical Implications

### Ukraine's Immediate Support
Within minutes of the news breaking, the Ukrainian government offered its full support to the Israeli government in defending against the assault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This swift support from Ukraine is notable, as it far exceeds the assistance Israel had previously offered Ukraine in response to the Russian invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Ukraine had previously expressed annoyance with Israel's attempt to remain neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Israel's previous fence-sitting stemmed from its population, which is roughly one-sixth Russian, and its efforts to maintain open communication channels with Russia to influence events in the Arab world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. It remains to be seen if Ukraine's quick support will alter Israel's mindset regarding its own existential issues with groups like Hamas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Potential Russian Involvement
While there is no direct indication of Russian involvement in the Hamas attacks, some tactics employed appear familiar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Hamas has shared footage of its attacks, including those on civilian targets, which would typically be considered war crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Furthermore, senior Hamas leadership has had frequent visits to Moscow over the past year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The political dynamics surrounding this potential connection are ongoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### Saudi-Israeli Normalization Talks
The attacks occurred amidst deep negotiations between Saudi Arabia and Israel for a normalization program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Most Arab countries still do not recognize Israel as an independent state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. While some progress was made under the Trump administration with Morocco and the United Arab Emirates recognizing Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, the Biden administration's goal is to facilitate normalization with Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

A key debate within Saudi Arabia, particularly a generational one, revolves around whether to completely abandon the Palestinian cause and normalize relations with Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. The older generation, represented by the King, prefers to continue backing the Palestinians, whereas the younger generation, led by Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman, is reportedly indifferent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The outcome of this internal Saudi power struggle, especially from the world's largest oil producer and exporter, could have significant implications backed by money, oil, and military power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This situation also speaks to the broader [[lack_of_regional_support_for_hamas | lack of regional support for Hamas]] from some Arab states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

Observers are monitoring Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for their statements on Ukraine, and Riyadh for its stance on Hamas, as these situations could lead to significant geopolitical shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

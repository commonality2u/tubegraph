Recent events highlight an unprecedented level of functional cooperation and coordination between Russia and China, particularly concerning actions against Finland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. These actions are characterized as "less than war scenarios" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, seemingly designed to test responses and capabilities.

## Coordinated Actions Against Finland

Over a few weeks, two significant, intentionally coordinated events occurred against Finland, a country that recently joined NATO, which displeased Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Russian Actions: Migrant Funneling
Russia began funneling illegal migrants from Central Asia and South Asia into the Finnish border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This was clearly intentional and premeditated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, as the daily number of migrants rapidly increased from less than one person to nearly a thousand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> in an area Russia considers a security zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### Chinese Actions: Cable and Pipeline Damage
A Chinese container ship, the "New New Polar Bear," dropped its anchor in the Gulf of Finland, between Finland and Estonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The ship then dragged the anchor along the seabed for approximately 20 miles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, severing a telecommunications cable and damaging a pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This incident was not accidental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, and the anchor has been matched to the vessel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Finnish and Estonian authorities have no doubt about what transpired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Implications of This Cooperation

This coordination between Russia and China has several strategic implications:

### Practice for Larger-Scale Operations
These events serve as practice for Russia and China, marking their first instance of functional cooperation and coordinated actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. By conducting two distinct actions in different theaters against the same country, they are rehearsing for a potentially larger scale of operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### Strategic Diversion for the United States
This cooperation aims to force the United States to divide its attention and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The U.S. does not consider itself capable of being involved in two major military operations simultaneously, even if one is naval (e.g., in China) and the other land-based (e.g., in Ukraine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Therefore, anything that compels the U.S. to look in two directions is considered a strategic win, regardless of the immediate outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### Impact on NATO Patrols
In response to these actions, [[NATOs response to Russia and China | NATO countries]] have already begun changing their naval patrol patterns to monitor for similar activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Target Choice: Finland
The choice of Finland as a target is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Historically neutral due to fear of the Soviet Union and then Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, Finland recently joined NATO. Russia likely perceived Finland as isolated and vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. However, this choice also underscores a breakdown in Russian diplomatic and security decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, as even Stalin was somewhat wary of the Finns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Finland's military is highly effective per capita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, having historically prepared for conflict with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Finland's strong relationships with its Scandinavian neighbors (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway), the United Kingdom, and now the United States, means Russia's actions are not just against Finland alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

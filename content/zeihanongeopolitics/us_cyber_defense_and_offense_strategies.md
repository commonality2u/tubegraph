The United States has developed distinct cyber strategies over decades, focusing heavily on offensive capabilities while traditionally leaving national cyber defense to individual entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:42">[02:17:42]</a>. Recent administrations have introduced shifts in this approach, particularly in response to [[russian_cyber_crime_and_hacking | Russian cyber activity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

## Historical Strategy: Reagan Era

When cyber technology first emerged in the 1980s, President Reagan made an executive decision that the U.S. would have no dedicated national cyber defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. Instead, all cyber offense was concentrated under the National Security Agency (NSA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:42">[01:44:42]</a>.

The NSA's mandate was to extensively hack non-allied nations daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. The close allies exempt from this activity included New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. The objective was to learn the digital architecture of other nations, implant backdoors, and compile password lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. This preparation was intended to allow the U.S. to "drop the hammer" and disable opposing systems in the event of a war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

The primary drawback of this strategy was the lack of national cyber defense outside of the NSA's self-protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. This means that in a major conflict, vital civilian infrastructure such as power grids, water supplies, and financial markets could be vulnerable to attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. However, in such a "hot war," the NSA's role would be to "obliterate the opposing side" to the point where they would lose electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

### "Dry Powder" Approach

In situations that do not constitute a full-scale "hot war," the NSA has maintained a "keep dry powder" strategy, implying a reserved use of its most potent cyber tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.

## Shifts Under Recent Administrations

### Donald Trump Administration

During his presidency, Donald Trump initiated a notable shift in cyber strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. After his election, he ordered the NSA to issue "cease and desist" letters directly to [[russian_cyber_crime_and_hacking | Russian hackers]] working for the [[russian_cyber_crime_and_hacking | Russian government]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. These letters included personal details, indicating that the U.S. knew the identities of those involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

### Biden Administration and the Ukraine War

The Biden administration significantly altered the "dry powder" approach in the early weeks of the Ukraine War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. U.S. cyber capabilities were unofficially deployed to "shatter" much of the [[russian_cyber_crime_and_hacking | Russian cyber capacity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.

This included targeting [[russian_cyber_crime_and_hacking | Russian organized crime groups]] involved in cyber activities, which, unlike state actors, lack robust defense capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. It was also revealed that the [[russian_cyber_crime_and_hacking | Russian state cyber group]] was "not as hard" (resilient) as previously thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

These actions have severely hindered [[russian_cyber_crime_and_hacking | Russian cyber groups]], limiting their current capabilities to only "picket the edges" of Ukrainian or Western systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. This represents a significant and publicly unprecedented use of U.S. cyber tools over the past four decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

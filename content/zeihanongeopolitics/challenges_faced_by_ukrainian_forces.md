The [[ukrainian_counteroffensive_strategy | Ukrainian counter-offensive]], as of late June, has not achieved significant breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Despite their efforts, [[ukrainian_military_strategy_and_territorial_gains | Ukrainian forces]] have been "bogged down in attritional fighting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Defensive Obstacles

One of the primary challenges for [[ukrainian_counteroffensive_strategy | Ukrainian forces]] is the formidable [[russian_defensive_positions_and_supply_challenges | Russian defensive positions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. These defenses consist of:
*   **Minefields** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. For the most part, [[ukrainian_military_strategy_and_territorial_gains | Ukrainians]] have struggled to get through these initial minefields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Anti-tank barriers and trenches** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, including "dragon's teeth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

These multi-layered defenses have prevented [[ukrainian_counteroffensive_strategy | Ukrainian forces]] from achieving the strategic breakthroughs seen in Kherson and Kharkiv during the previous summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Advances have typically been in "single digits of kilometers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, without mobile forces getting behind [[russian_defensive_positions_and_supply_challenges | Russian lines]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

## Material and Demographic Disadvantage

[[ukrainian_military_strategy_and_territorial_gains | Ukraine]] faces a significant material and demographic disadvantage against [[russian_military_challenges_and_recruitment_issues | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. [[russian_military_challenges_and_recruitment_issues | Russia]] possesses an "order of magnitude more industrial plants and reserves" and "at least a factor of three more population" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

In battles where [[ukrainian_military_strategy_and_territorial_gains | Ukrainian forces]] are engaged in direct combat, they face an uphill battle. A situation where [[ukrainian_military_strategy_and_territorial_gains | Ukrainians]] "only kill three times as many [[russian_military_challenges_and_recruitment_issues | Russians]] as they lose in their own troops is about all they've lost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, indicating a high cost for limited gains.

## Adapting Strategy

Despite these challenges, there have been recent [[strategic_changes_in_ukrainian_military_tactics | strategic changes in Ukrainian military tactics]]. Since June 23rd, [[ukrainian_military_strategy_and_territorial_gains | Ukrainian forces]] shifted from targeting command and control bunkers to targeting ammo dumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This shift is typically undertaken before a major push to disrupt enemy supply lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

Furthermore, the Chonhar bridge in Crimea was struck by missiles, making the rail system impassable for weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This strike on a critical [[russian_logistics_challenges_in_crimea | Russian logistics]] route aims to cut off supplies to [[russian_defensive_positions_and_supply_challenges | Russian forces]] in occupied Ukraine, particularly those west of Mariupol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

These actions create a window of opportunity for [[ukrainian_counteroffensive_strategy | Ukrainian forces]] to exploit weaknesses in [[russian_defensive_positions_and_supply_challenges | Russian supply lines]], especially when combined with internal [[strategic_challenges_for_russian_military_withdrawal | Russian instability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

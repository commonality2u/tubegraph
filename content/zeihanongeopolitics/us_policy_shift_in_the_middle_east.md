The United States appears to be contemplating a significant [[shifts_in_us_foreign_policy_and_its_implications | shift in its policy]] towards the Middle East, potentially catalyzed by the ongoing conflict in Gaza [00:00:11]. This [[potential_geopolitical_shifts | potential geopolitical shift]] could lead to a re-evaluation of long-standing alliances and a realignment of strategic partnerships in the region [06:24:00].

## The Gaza Humanitarian Crisis and US Intervention

In response to the severe humanitarian situation in Gaza, the Biden Administration has publicly committed to building a floating dock to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid [00:00:24]. This initiative aims to provide throughput for at least 2 million meals a day, covering roughly one-third of the territory's food demands [00:00:33].

Gaza, described as an "open-air prison camp," is entirely dependent on aid for food, as it grows none of its own [00:00:42]. Following the October Hamas attacks on Israel, which resulted in significant casualties, Israel's counter-effort has destroyed an estimated two-thirds of Gaza's housing stock and most of its infrastructure [01:00:00]. An anticipated assault on the southern part of the strip, targeting remaining Hamas elements, is expected to further worsen the humanitarian crisis, with current civilian deaths already exceeding 35,000, representing over 1% of the pre-war population [01:12:00], [01:24:00].

This conflict has become the highest-casualty conflict in recent years outside of Sub-Saharan Africa [01:39:00]. Gaza is not self-sustaining; it cannot generate its own energy or grow its own food, making it entirely reliant on external aid, which has been severely restricted by Israeli blockades during the war [01:52:00].

## Implications of the Floating Dock and US Military Presence

The US commitment to the floating dock necessitates a substantial [[us_military_involvement_and_middle_eastern_politics | US military presence]] in Gaza [04:41:00]. Logistics require a team to deliver aid by small boat to the dock, followed by "boots on the ground" in Gaza to set up a truck distribution system [04:09:00]. Delivering 2 million meals daily is a logistical undertaking on a much larger scale than the Berlin Airlift, and unlike airlifts, requires physical distribution on the ground [04:22:00]. Given that the UN cannot operate effectively in wartime Gaza, only the [[us_military_involvement_and_middle_eastern_politics | US military]] is deemed capable [04:36:00].

This would result in a larger [[us_military_involvement_and_middle_eastern_politics | US military presence]] in and around Gaza than in the rest of the Middle East combined [04:42:00]. Such a presence is unlikely to be acceptable to the Israelis [04:50:00]. Furthermore, Hamas remains active in the region, implying that [[us_military_involvement_and_middle_eastern_politics | US forces]] will likely face attacks [04:41:00].

Despite the potential risks, the floating dock is designed for rapid deployment and withdrawal, allowing for swift evacuation of US personnel if necessary [04:58:00]. This distinguishes it from previous withdrawals like the Afghan evacuation from Kabul airport, which faced severe bottlenecks [05:04:00].

## Potential Breach with Israel and Regional Alliances

The Biden Administration's commitment to delivering aid, despite Israeli opposition, suggests a potential "breach" in the US-Israeli relationship [05:55:00]. Historically, President Biden has had a strained relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose policies during the conflict have not changed despite international pressure [02:33:00], [02:46:00]. Israel views the destruction of Hamas as crucial for its security and perceives the US aid initiative as contrary to its national security interests [03:00:00], [03:33:00]. There is broad support within Israel for the military operation in Gaza across the political spectrum [03:50:00].

This potential shift could lead to an [[the_impact_of_us_disengagement_from_the_middle_east | end to US involvement]] in the wider Middle East [06:17:00]. The Biden Administration previously ended [[the_impact_of_us_disengagement_from_the_middle_east | American involvement in Afghanistan]] and has significantly scaled back its presence elsewhere in the region [06:09:00]. A full pullout from the entire region is considered "very possible" [06:20:00].

Such a move would have significant consequences for existing alliances [06:25:00]. Israel has cultivated diplomatic relationships with Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, and the UAE, and is close to normalizing relations with Saudi Arabia [06:31:00]. If the [[the_impact_of_us_disengagement_from_the_middle_east | United States were to disengage]] from Israel, these countries would be left to manage regional dynamics on their own [06:45:00], potentially leading to new [[middle_east_security_dynamics_postamerica | alliances forming]] out of desperation [07:00:00]. A disengagement could also mean the US cutting ties with Persian Gulf states like the UAE and Saudi Arabia [07:08:00].

## Shift Towards Turkey

If the US intends to maintain influence in the region post-disengagement from traditional allies, its only viable partner is Turkey [07:35:00]. Recent months have seen renewed diplomatic connections between the Biden Administration and Turkey's ErdoÄŸan administration [07:43:00].

Despite the current Turkish government's strong dislike for Israel, Turkey possesses the most powerful military in the region, arguably more powerful than all others combined [07:52:00]. A post-Israel, post-Saudi American position in the region would likely necessitate a partnership with Turkey [08:02:00]. Multiple meetings at the assistant defense secretary level have already taken place to discuss improving relations, which have been poor since the Iraq War began in 2003 [08:08:00].

## Strategic Rationale and Future Outlook

This [[shift_in_us_global_strategic_role | potential shift in US global strategic role]] is seen by some as an attractive approach, as it allows the US to distance itself from Israel's military operations, which are causing international discomfort [08:37:00]. It also provides an opportunity to reduce relations with countries perceived as problematic, like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, while fostering ties with a more democratic, strategically viable, and capable nation like Turkey [08:51:00].

The full extent of the Biden Administration's commitment to this [[shifts_in_us_foreign_policy_and_its_implications | policy shift]] remains uncertain [09:14:00]. More data points on US intentions are expected within the next two to three months, particularly once the Gaza dock is operational or if a significant [[impact_of_us_policy_shift_on_china | shift in American relations with Turkey]] becomes evident [09:18:00]. This unfolding situation highlights the complex [[us_involvement_in_the_middle_east_and_challenges_in_global_security | challenges in global security]] and [[geopolitical_tensions_in_the_middle_east | geopolitical tensions in the Middle East]] [09:18:00].

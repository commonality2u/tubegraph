The ongoing [[russian_military_strategies_and_advancements_in_ukraine | Ukraine conflict]] has significantly impacted Russia's naval capabilities and strategic outlook, highlighting and exacerbating what is known as Russia's "four seas problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## The "Four Seas Problem"

Most countries with significant navies either have a limited frontage or their naval access is insulated from land power neighbors, allowing for a concentrated fleet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. For example, the United States built the Panama Canal to combine its two ocean navies into a single force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Island nations like the United Kingdom or Japan benefit from easily combining their naval forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

However, Russia, despite being the physically largest country on Earth, has never had this option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Russia's naval forces are geographically separated into four distinct fleets:
*   The Pacific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
*   The Arctic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>
*   The Baltic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>
*   The Black Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>

This dispersion means that Russia cannot easily combine its naval forces, making it vulnerable to "defeat in detail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Historical Precedent: The Russo-Japanese War

The Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905 serves as a quintessential example of this problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. After Japan destroyed the Russian Pacific fleet in China, Russia spent nearly a year sailing the rest of its navy from the European theater around Asia to reinforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The Japanese subsequently destroyed this reinforcing fleet as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. In less than a year and across two battles, Russia lost its entire navy because it could not combine its forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Historically, Russia has also tended to lag technologically in naval matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Current Impact on Russian Naval Power

The [[russian_strategies_and_developments_in_the_ukraine_war | Ukraine conflict]] has severely exacerbated Russia's "four seas problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>, leading to a significant [[challenges_of_russian_naval_power | challenges of Russian Naval Power]].

### The Black Sea Fleet

The conflict's focus on the Black Sea has had a devastating [[impact_on_russian_military_operations_in_crimea | Impact on Russian military operations in Crimea]] for the Russian navy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. While Russia reinforced its Black Sea Fleet leading up to the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, the combination of Western-supplied weapons and Ukrainian "garage projects" (innovative drone attacks) has allowed Ukraine to sink the majority of Russia's major surface combatants, including its flagship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

Consequently, any remaining Russian naval vessels that would normally dock in Crimea are now within range of Ukrainian weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. This has forced Russia to largely close its primary naval base and shipyards in Crimea, moving operations further east to Novorossiysk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. However, Novorossiysk lacks the necessary dry docks, service capabilities, and shipbuilding facilities of the Crimean bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This represents a significant [[impact_of_ukrainian_attacks_on_russian_commercial_shipping | Impact of Ukrainian attacks on Russian commercial shipping]].

### The Baltic Sea Fleet

Russia's actions in Ukraine have also prompted Sweden and Finland to join NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. These two nations, along with existing NATO members, now control the vast majority of the Baltic Sea frontage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. With Finland already a member and Sweden expected to join soon, Russia's access to the Baltic Sea is effectively reduced to tiny segments around Kaliningrad and St. Petersburg, less than 5% of the total frontage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. To reach the open sea, Russian ships must now sail past nine NATO countries, effectively making the Baltic Sea a NATO lake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Conclusion: Russia No Longer a Naval Power

Regardless of the eventual outcome of the [[us_military_strategy_in_the_ukraine_war | Ukraine war]], Russia has "functionally ceased to be a naval power at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The Arctic and Pacific fleets, already separate, have been further depleted by transfers to the Black Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

This diminished naval capability has profound [[strategic_and_diplomatic_implications_for_russia | strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia]], especially given its high dependence on naval shipments for its economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Russian industry relies on sea lanes to export oil, liquefied natural gas, aluminum, and other commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. With its current inability to project power regionally or globally, the United States and Europe could, with ease, shut down the Russian economy at sea in a matter of days if they chose to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This signals a future where the world may need to prepare for a significant reduction in [[economic_implications_of_russias_naval_limitations | Russian commodity exports]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

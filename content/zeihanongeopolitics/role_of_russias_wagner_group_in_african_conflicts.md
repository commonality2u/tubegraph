The recent coup in Niger has brought the role of foreign powers in African conflicts, particularly that of [[wagner_group_and_its_role_in_russian_military_operations | Russia's Wagner group]], into sharp focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. While economically insignificant in terms of uranium supply, Niger is a strategic linchpin for French post-colonial operations in the Sahel region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## French Historical Presence in the Sahel

Historically, France acquired vast territories in the Sahel during the Imperial era, viewing it as a matter of national ego and size, contrasting with the British approach of seeking natural markets or transport nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Today, many of these former French outposts are economically volatile and difficult to defend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

The Sahel in West Africa is plagued by jihadist insurgencies due to its near-desert conditions and the inability of local countries to build sufficient security capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This reliance often compels these nations to invite French forces to maintain order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. However, regions with low population density and fragile systems are prone to coups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

Previous coups have occurred in Mali and Burkina Faso, leading to the withdrawal of French troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Should Niger follow suit, it would signify the effective end of French post-colonial anti-insurgency operations in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Wagner Group's Role in Regional Instability

A significant factor contributing to the success of coupsters in Burkina Faso, Mali, and likely Niger, is their connection to [[wagner_group_and_its_role_in_russian_military_operations | Russia's Wagner group]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

The [[wagner_group_and_its_role_in_russian_military_operations | Wagner Group]] recently experienced an [[wagner_group_coup_attempt_in_russia | aborted coup]] in Russia and was largely purged from the military system in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Despite this, many of their operations persist within Africa, where "the rules are a little bit more flexible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Keeping [[wagner_group_and_its_role_in_russian_military_operations | Wagner]] active in Africa also serves Russia's interest by keeping them away from Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. While efforts are underway to directly integrate [[wagner_group_and_its_role_in_russian_military_operations | Wagner]] into the Russian state to purge disloyal leadership, elements of the group are expected to remain active in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

[[wagner_group_and_its_role_in_russian_military_operations | Wagner]] has faced accusations of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and now that it is recognized as directly controlled by the Russian state, other nations are treating its actions with increased gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Potential for French and Russian Confrontation

The situation presents France with a critical decision regarding its future involvement in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Option 1: Direct Intervention

France could intervene militarily to neutralize the coup leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. France possesses highly capable special forces, comparable to American special forces, with fewer political restrictions on their operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

This course of action could lead to a direct [[potential_french_and_russian_conflicts_in_africa | confrontation between French and Russian forces in Africa]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Such a conflict would likely result in the decimation of Russian forces, whose logistics depend entirely on international trade and shipments, in contrast to France's expeditionary Navy and elite special forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This decision would require a significant political shift for France, which has generally tried to maintain relations with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

### Option 2: Withdrawal

Alternatively, France could accept defeat and withdraw from the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. This would significantly reduce France's sphere of interest and ability to project power globally, forcing a greater focus on Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Given Europe's involvement in a war with Russia, this withdrawal could still lead to France taking more direct action against Russia, whether in Ukraine or Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

Ultimately, Paris is being compelled to take more direct action against Russia, leading to a rare degree of lockstep agreement within the Western world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. France, known for its capable and assertive military, is expected to commit fully, which could pose a significant challenge for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

The [[banking_issues_in_the_united_states_in_2023 | United States]] experienced a "banking hiccup" in March 2023, marked by the closure or collapse of three notable banks: Silvergate, Signature, and Silicon Valley Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. While not considered a systemic crisis akin to the [[comparison_of_2023_banking_hiccup_to_2007_financial_crisis | 2007 financial crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, these failures are significantly linked to the tech industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Unique Nature of Tech Banking Failures

Unlike typical financial crises driven by problematic loans, the recent failures, particularly those of Silicon Valley Bank, stemmed from issues with deposits rather than lending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Capital-Intensive Industry
The technology sector is highly capital-intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Banks catering to newer firms, startups, and research companies, such as Silicon Valley Bank, service clients that often do not generate immediate profits but rely on future potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. When [[capital_availability_and_its_effects_on_technology_development | capital costs rise]], these companies face significant challenges, which in turn impacts the banks that serve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Tech Boom and Bust Cycle
The tech industry experienced a boom from 2020 through 2022, fueled by cheap capital and increased demand for technology products during the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This surge led to a market saturation, making a "tech bust" somewhat inevitable, independent of broader economic trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Venture Capital and Deposit Withdrawals
Tech startups typically secure capital directly from venture capitalists (VCs) rather than traditional business loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. As VCs faced constraints on available capital, startups began drawing down their cash reserves held in banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This reduction in deposits, rather than a wave of bad loans, became the primary problem for these tech-focused banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## Implications for the Banking System

### Uninsured Deposits
A significant factor in the severity of these failures was the large amount of uninsured deposits held by tech startups. Many of these companies consolidated their funds into single banks like Silicon Valley Bank, often far exceeding the [[role_of_fdic_in_banking_stability | Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)]] limit of $250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

### Government Intervention and Moral Hazard
The [[biden_administrations_response_to_banking_issues_and_moral_hazard | Biden Administration]] intervened to guarantee all depositors, even those with uninsured funds, would be made whole by the FDIC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. While this action prevented a wider bank run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, it also introduced a "moral hazard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This intervention effectively incentivized companies to continue risky deposit practices by removing the consequences for failing to understand deposit insurance limits, potentially leading to future "stupidity into the financial system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

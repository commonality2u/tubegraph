In the post-American world, India is identified as a significant power that may not suffer many of the negative impacts expected to sweep the globe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. India's energy supply comes from the Persian Gulf, and its agricultural system is largely self-sufficient, including fertilizer production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. India is situated in an area not heavily dependent on global trade, similar to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Historical Stance and Alliances

During the Cold War, India chose not to participate in the economic aspects of the global order, viewing it as an American plan, and instead tilted towards the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. While the dissolution of that system affects India, it does so less severely and for a shorter duration than for many other nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

India has historically lacked allies and a history of bilateral relationships based on trust or sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. This contrasts sharply with Western nations or countries with deep military experience with the United States like Taiwan, Korea, Japan, or Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

## Strategic Limitations

India is considered a "pocket power," geographically bounded by hostile countries like Pakistan, deserts, the Himalayas, or jungles and mountains of Southeast Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Even if India were to conquer its bordering countries, it would not significantly expand its economic footprint or improve its strategic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

This means India is largely limited to the Indian Ocean Basin and will likely never become a significant naval power due to its many potential hostiles on land borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. While Indians often speak of themselves as an upcoming global power, they will be unable to break out of this [[indias_strategic_limitations_and_geographic_constraints | geographic box]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. However, this geographic limitation also makes it difficult for other powers to break into India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Relations with Major Powers

### China
India's manufacturing sector has been significantly impacted by China's development process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Chinese products have flooded into India, driving local manufacturers out of business, an experience similar to that of the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### United States and Western Relations
Over the last decade, U.S. strategic policy has made efforts to [[great_power_politics_involving_india_and_western_relations | court India]] away from its old pro-Soviet leanings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. However, this approach is not working because India's foreign policy is driven by its own national interests, described as "India does things for India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

While American-Indian relations do not have to be hostile, they are not based on an alliance or friendship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Deals can be made on a case-by-case basis, and there are opportunities for cooperation, but there are limits to this relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Future Foreign Policy Trajectory

India's actions are determined by what it perceives to be necessary for its own benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   **Ukraine War**: India is not expected to be overly helpful to Ukraine, but also not overly hurtful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **U.S.-China Spat**: If the United States engages in a conflict with [[comparison_of_india_and_china | China]], India might cheer from the sidelines but is unlikely to take significant action on its own unless it identifies an opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   **Energy Crisis**: In a future world where energy is scarce, India is expected to take action with its own forces for its own reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. The speaker suggests that in the Persian Gulf, India would be a greater concern than the U.S., China, Japan, Britain, or France due to its proximity and capability to project force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. India is one of the few countries that could deploy forces to the Persian Gulf if it chose to, with only the United States theoretically capable of inhibiting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. This potential action depends on a future energy crisis, which has not yet been triggered by the Ukraine war or Chinese actions regarding Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. This is partly due to the United States no longer having forces in the Persian Gulf in force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. These actions could have [[global_implications_of_indian_governments_actions_abroad | global implications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

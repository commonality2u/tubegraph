The [[Sinaloa Cartel internal conflict | Sinaloa Cartel]], traditionally a highly structured criminal organization, has experienced significant internal conflict and a breakdown in its operations following the capture and imprisonment of its key leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This shift illustrates the critical [[impact_of_leadership_change_on_russias_war_efforts | impact of leadership change]] on [[cartel_violence_and_structure_in_mexico | cartel operations]].

## The Sinaloa Cartel's Unique Structure

The [[Sinaloa Cartel | Sinaloa Cartel]] is distinct among organized crime groups because it operates less like a simple power-driven entity and more like a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Under its former leader, [[el_chapo_s_leadership_and_capture | El Chapo]], the cartel maintained good relations with local populations and law enforcement in areas of operation to avoid drawing attention and to prevent communities from turning them in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. [[el_chapo_s_leadership_and_capture | El Chapo]] reportedly held meetings with his chapter leads to share best practices and find ways to transport drugs to the [[influence_of_sinaloa_cartel_in_the_united_states | United States]] with minimal disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This approach allowed the [[Sinaloa Cartel | cartel]] to become the largest organized crime group in Mexico and globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

The overall structure of Mexican cartels is not monolithic, often consisting of several dozen locally defined groups that may use different names and organizational structures, giving only "lip service" to the central leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This system requires a strong leader with a "light/firm hand" and excellent communication skills to maintain cohesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## The Impact of Leadership Loss

### El Chapo's Capture and Succession Issues
[[el_chapo_s_leadership_and_capture | El Chapo]] was eventually captured and extradited to the [[influence_of_sinaloa_cartel_in_the_united_states | United States]], where he is serving multiple life sentences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. His absence left the organization in the hands of less competent individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. While a "murderous thug," [[el_chapo_s_leadership_and_capture | El Chapo]] possessed managerial experience and a business-oriented mindset that his successors lack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Escalating Internal Conflict
The [[Sinaloa Cartel internal conflict | internal conflict]] significantly worsened in July following the capture of Ismael Zambada, also known as "El Mayo," who had taken over most operations after [[el_chapo_s_leadership_and_capture | El Chapo]]'s imprisonment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. El Mayo was reportedly lured to Texas by one of [[el_chapo_s_leadership_and_capture | El Chapo]]'s sons and arrested by American law enforcement upon arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

With both [[el_chapo_s_leadership_and_capture | El Chapo]] and El Mayo out of the picture, [[el_chapo_s_leadership_and_capture | El Chapo]]'s sons ("Los Chapitos"), who control their own factions, are now fighting among themselves over control of the [[Sinaloa Cartel | cartel]]'s remaining share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This has led to the largest organized crime group in Mexico being in a state of breakdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

### Consequences of Disintegration

*   **Increased Violence in Mexico:** The [[Sinaloa Cartel internal conflict | internal conflict]] has already resulted in at least 100 murders and numerous abductions in Sinaloa state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This violence is expected to expand beyond Sinaloa to other parts of Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Local chapters are likely to act independently, while central factions attempt to reassert control violently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Impact on the United States:** The [[Sinaloa Cartel | cartel]]'s breakdown will also affect its operations north of the border, particularly in the [[influence_of_sinaloa_cartel_in_the_united_states | United States]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Local distribution and retail operations, often run by local gangs, are expected to go their own way and resist control from the [[Sinaloa Cartel | Sinaloa]] leadership factions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Economic Consequences:** The disruption to the distribution system is anticipated to lead to higher drug prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. More violence is also expected due to the organizational breakdowns at regional and local levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

The ongoing [[Sinaloa Cartel internal conflict | internal conflict]] highlights how the loss of strong, centralized leadership can cause the disintegration of complex criminal organizations, leading to widespread violence and disruption in their operations.

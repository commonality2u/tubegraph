China's economy is highly dependent on the international community and global trade for its sustenance and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:28">[01:24:28]</a>.

## Critical Import Dependencies

*   **Energy Sources**: China relies on the international community for approximately three-quarters of its [[chinas_import_dependency_on_energy_and_materials | energy sources]], with most of these supplies originating from other continents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:28">[01:24:28]</a>.
*   **Raw Materials for Food Production**: The vast majority of [[chinas_import_dependency_on_energy_and_materials | materials]] required for China to grow its own food are imported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:37">[01:42:37]</a>.

## Overall Trade Volume

In terms of absolute volumes, China is the most [[chinas_economic_dependency_on_exports | dependent on imports and exports]] of any country globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:47">[01:37:47]</a>.

## Reliance on the International System

China's ability to obtain necessary resources and facilitate its trade is contingent upon the international system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:43">[02:29:43]</a>. Specifically, China relies on the U.S. Navy to patrol global oceans, ensuring the safe passage of its commercial cargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

## Potential Consequences of Trade Disruption

Any moderate effort by other countries to target Chinese commerce could lead to severe repercussions:

*   **Industrial Collapse**: The country could face an [[chinas_potential_collapse_and_its_impact_on_global_industry | industrial collapse]] within months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:04">[01:55:04]</a>.
*   **Famine and Population Decline**: Such a collapse could result in widespread famine, potentially leading to the death of half the population within a couple of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:26">[02:01:26]</a>.

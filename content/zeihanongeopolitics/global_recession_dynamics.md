The global economy is currently experiencing widespread slowdowns and recessions, with notable exceptions. The United Kingdom, Japan, and Germany are officially in recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. China, based on available data, is either in or very close to recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Many other economies, including Israel, the Netherlands, most of Scandinavia, and Western Europe, are also slowing down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Even countries still experiencing growth, such as India, are doing so at a very slow pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Australia and New Zealand are likely close to recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Key Drivers of the Global Slowdown

Two primary factors contribute to this broad economic downturn:

### China's Demographic and Economic Challenges

The anticipated post-COVID economic rebound in China never materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This is largely attributed to severe [[Global demographic shifts and future economic implications | global demographic shifts]]. Improved data indicates that China has experienced a significant population collapse that is not recent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The American birth rate has surpassed the Chinese birth rate since the mid-1990s, suggesting China is running out of working-age adults rather than just children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Recent data also shows a drastic shortage of children entering kindergarten, indicating a sharp decline in births starting five years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

This means China is facing a critical shortage of people under age 50, effectively eliminating the possibility of consumption-driven economic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This situation poses a massive problem for countries that export raw materials to China, such as Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Advanced Economies' Demographic Headwinds

For European nations and Japan, the problem is also demographic, but further along the curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. On average, half of the world's Baby Boomers have already retired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Countries like Italy hit this phase earlier, with Germany currently undergoing it and Korea about to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Spain and the Netherlands are also in poor shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

Consumption tends to drop significantly once individuals age out of their mid-40s and plummets upon retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Large parts of the advanced world have now reached this point, eliminating consumption-led growth as a possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. When combined with limited export-led growth to China and a potential closing off of the American market, these economies have little left to drive growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

Given these factors, with Europe, Northeast Asia, and China facing significant economic headwinds, the world may have already experienced its last major period of global [[Global economic restructuring and its impacts | economic growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## North America as an Exception

In stark contrast to the rest of the world, North America, particularly the United States, is currently performing well economically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This is due to a combination of factors:

*   **Millennial Consumption:** The single largest driver is the ongoing consumption by Millennials, who remain in their consumption-heavy age bracket for years to come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Government Investment:** Significant government investment from the Biden Administration is generating growth in the short to mid-term, despite future debt implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This reflects [[influence_of_global_dynamics_on_us_policy_priorities | US policy priorities]] to stimulate domestic activity.
*   **Industrial Construction Boom:** Industrial construction spending in the United States has surged in recent years as companies realize they need to build things domestically if they want products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This trend is expected to continue for at least another decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## A Bifurcated Global Future

The world is entering a sharply bifurcated economic period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. North America appears increasingly promising due to its domestic growth drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Meanwhile, other regions are losing their ability to generate consumption-led growth and are increasingly struggling with export-led growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This implies a significant [[Global Economic System Transformation | transformation of the global economic system]] and potentially [[economic_restructuring_in_post_globalized_world | economic restructuring in a post-globalized world]] as the previous models of growth falter.

This situation could lead to various outcomes, including:
*   Producers "falling off the map" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   Unreplaced supply chains breaking, leading to depression-like activity alongside inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This scenario, indicating a move away from integrated global supply chains, could fuel [[reasons_for_deglobalization_momentum | reasons for deglobalization momentum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

These challenging conditions are expected to persist at least until the end of the decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

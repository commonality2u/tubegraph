Ukrainian forces have increasingly targeted Russian fuel storage, supply lines, and logistics infrastructure, creating significant challenges for Russian military operations on various fronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. These strikes aim to disrupt supply chains, particularly for fuel, which is crucial for sustaining military movements and operations.

## Impact on Northern Front Logistics

During the [[ukrainian_offensive_into_russia | Ukrainian offensive into Russia]] in the Kursk Province, Ukrainian forces moved their longer-range missiles, mortars, and drones close to the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. They are launching strikes up to 100 miles into Russian territory, effectively [[economic_implications_for_russia_due_to_ukrainian_attacks | gutting the logistics infrastructure]] in the southern and western parts of Kursk Province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This strategic move aims to cut off the supply infrastructure between Kursk City and Belgorod City, which is how all Russian forces on the northern front receive their supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Disruption of Crimean Fuel Supply

Ukraine has successfully targeted and sunk Russia's last rail ferry, which was a critical means of supplying Russian forces in the Crimean Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The Kerch Strait bridge, previously the primary supply route, has had its cargo function shut off due to a series of previous Ukrainian attacks over the last two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

With the bridge unable to transport cargo, including fuel, Russia resorted to using rail ferries from its Black Sea coast to occupied Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. The final rail ferry was struck while docked in port and sunk in its berth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Salvage operations would take a minimum of several months, and Russia currently has no replacement rail ferries, nor can it purchase new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This effectively [[impact_of_ukrainian_attacks_on_russian_commercial_shipping | destroys Russia's capacity to ship fuel]] to the Crimean front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Major Fuel Depot Attack in Proletarsk

A significant [[ukrainian_attacks_on_russian_oil_refineries_and_their_significance | Ukrainian strike]] targeted a major fuel depot in Proletarsk, located in the Krasnodar Krai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This depot housed 74 large fuel tanks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The resulting fire has been so intense that it has completely destroyed a third of the tanks and is spreading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Even if Russian forces had the equipment and personnel to fight the fire, which they reportedly do not, it is out of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

Ukrainian forces have continued subsequent attacks on the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. There is a high possibility that this entire depot, which is the largest and most relevant for the Crimean front, will be permanently out of commission within weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This loss affects not only fuel delivery but also forward fuel storage, which would open a substantial opportunity for Ukraine to press operations in Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. If Russian forces in Crimea cannot receive fuel, supplies, or reinforcements, their ability to defend the peninsula will be severely hampered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The combined impact of these strikes on Russian [[impact_of_ukrainian_strikes_on_russian_energy_infrastructure | energy infrastructure]] indicates a very dynamic situation on the front lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

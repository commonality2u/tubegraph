Japan is highlighted as a country that has successfully navigated the shifting global order and the changing nature of the [[US military power and economic influence | US strategic relationship]] post-Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Historical Context: Cold War Era

During the Cold War, the United States provided economic and strategic concessions to its allies, including Japan, in order to build alliances and unite against the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This approach was aimed at ensuring broad support for the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Shifting US Engagement

A few government administrations ago, the Japanese government recognized that the Americans were becoming less interested in maintaining previous levels of global engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This posed a challenge for Japan, which, like many nations, relies heavily on international trade for its economic well-being, particularly for energy imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

The realization was that unless Japan could gain entry into the "American Inner Circle" and offer the US something it desired, its future would be uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This situation is even more critical for smaller, less capable countries than Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Japan's Strategic Adaptation

In response to this changing dynamic, Japan proactively sought a deal with the United States on America's terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

> "Now if you have a more disassociated America you have to bring the case to them, you have to offer them something in order to keep them involved and in Japan it was trade concessions and a security partnership." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>

This demonstrates Japan's successful strategy in adapting to a global environment where the US is less inclined to unilaterally provide support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. For other countries, engaging the US now requires a more aggressive and proactive approach of offering significant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

Syria is considered an artificial construct, as the territory it occupies has not had a functional government for centuries before its modern formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The modern state of Syria emerged from the Mandate period following World War I, when former colonies were dissolved and independent states began to form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Formation from Residual Territories

During this period, other regions in the Middle East claimed more desirable territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>:
*   Mesopotamia became Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   Saudi Arabia established its independence, bolstered by its oil reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   Egypt also gained independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   Turkey took valuable sections, particularly "the hat" (Hatay Province), located in the northeast corner of the Mediterranean, known for reliable rainfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This region is geographically significant and is related to the broader topic of [[geopolitical_significance_of_turkeys_location | geopolitical significance of Turkey's location]].
*   France established Lebanon as a separate entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Syria was essentially what remained after these partitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The idea that a cohesive state could emerge from this "rump" territory was considered a "stretch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This artificiality has contributed to a prolonged period of civil conflict as various groups vie for control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Internal Dynamics and Conflict

The Alawites, a minority group residing on the coast, eventually gained control of Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. They formed alliances with other minority groups in the country to oppose the Sunni Arab majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The current revolution was initiated by the Sunni Arabs, leading to the overthrow of the Assad regime, who were Alawites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Establishing a functional government from this situation is expected to take a very long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

The continuation of the Assad regime for an extended period was largely due to the intervention of the [[russias_role_in_the_syrian_civil_war | Russian government]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Historically, the Soviets supported Syria due to its anti-Israeli stance, contrasting with Israel's alignment with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. More recently, the Putin government used the existing Syrian Civil War as a means to distract European and American attention from its own aggressive military actions in its periphery and eventually in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

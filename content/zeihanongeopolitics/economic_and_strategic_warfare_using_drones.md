The nature of warfare is undergoing a significant transformation, often referred to as a "Revolution in Military Affairs" (RMA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This revolution is now progressing through a second phase, characterized by the democratization and decentralized application of advanced military technologies, particularly [[Drones and autonomous warfare | drones]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Phases of the Revolution in Military Affairs

### Phase 1: US-Led Precision Warfare
The first phase of the RMA occurred in the 1990s and 2000s, spearheaded by the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This era involved marrying information technologies with military capabilities, integrating sensors and targeting information into weapons systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Examples include Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) and Tomahawk cruise missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The objective was to deliver explosive ordnance with a very high degree of accuracy, enabling specific target strikes rather than carpet bombing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. While there was discussion about precision weapons combined with hypersonics changing all rules of warfare, the high cost of hypersonics limited their determining role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This phase transformed the United States' "lumbering Cold War defense industry" into a force with "extreme range and extreme precision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

### Phase 2: Democratization and Decentralization of Warfare
The current second phase involves the "democratization of the application of these technologies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Control is shifting from centralized command (White House or generals) to individual soldiers who can use information to make autonomous targeting decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This shift is most aggressively observed in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## [[Role of drones in modern warfare | Drones]] in Ukraine's Strategy
Ukraine is currently employing a four-part strategy primarily leveraging [[Drones and autonomous warfare | drones]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>:

1.  **[[Ukrainian Naval drone attacks on Russian military vessels | Naval Drone Attacks]]**: Ukraine is converting jet skis into autonomous naval drones, loading them with hundreds of pounds of explosives to target Russian naval vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This tactic has been highly effective, making the western half of the Black Sea a no-go zone for the Russian Fleet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Larger Russian ships are often unable to retaliate because their deck-mounted weapons are designed for targets at or above the horizon and cannot angle down sufficiently to hit small boats in the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

2.  **[[Ukrainian drone missile innovations | Anti-Personnel Drones]]**: Due to challenges in receiving conventional aid, particularly artillery shells, Ukraine has begun mass-producing very small drones with payloads of about one pound (grenade-sized) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. These are deployed in swarms against Russian human wave tactics, effectively dropping grenades from a distance onto massed infantry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. In the Battle of Avdiivka, Ukraine reportedly inflicted 8:1 and 10:1 casualty ratios on the Russians despite lacking artillery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

3.  **[[Ukraines longerrange drone capabilities | Mid-Range Infrastructure Strikes]]**: Ukraine has developed drones like the "Scythe" and the more technologically advanced "Beaver" (which has longer range and better avionics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The Scythe is described as a "garage project" made of plywood, carrying a decent warhead but with less range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. These drones are used to strike infrastructure targets within a few hundred kilometers of the front line, including Russian refineries and fuel depots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

4.  **[[Ukraines longerrange drone capabilities | Long-Range Strategic and Economic Strikes]]**: The United States has provided the "Phoenix Ghost" drone, which carries a smaller warhead (5 to 15 lbs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Its advantages include being modular, light enough for one soldier to carry, and having a live visual feed back to the controller for high accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Initially used against armored vehicles and supply trucks, Ukrainians quickly adapted them for long-range strikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
    *   **Refinery Attacks**: Ukrainian Special Forces are likely using American-made Phoenix Ghost drones deep within the Russian interior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. These attacks have regularly taken offline 0.5 to 1 million barrels per day of Russian refining capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. The drones' accuracy allows operators to target sensitive areas like distillation towers, maximizing damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
    *   **Economic Impact**: Repairing damaged refineries is difficult for Russia due to a lack of trained engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Interrupting refining capacity directly impacts Russian government revenues, which typically derive about 8% from oil refining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. If crude oil cannot be processed, it creates pressure in the pipeline system, potentially forcing production shut-ins which are difficult to restart without engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

### Broader Implications
This new phase of warfare combines strategic, naval, infantry, and economic warfare in ways that seemed impossible just months prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Most of the [[Drones and autonomous warfare | drones]] employed are 100% Ukrainian-born specialties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine is drawing observers from many countries, similar to how the American Civil War and Crimean campaigns were observed for insights into early industrial warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

This new reality means retaining the precision of Phase 1 while marrying it to individual decision-making, deploying tens of thousands of decentralized weapons platforms that can be launched rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The ability for individuals to target enemy formations at scale across a thousand-mile front, and hundreds of miles beyond, is unprecedented in military history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. This represents a fundamentally new technological breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

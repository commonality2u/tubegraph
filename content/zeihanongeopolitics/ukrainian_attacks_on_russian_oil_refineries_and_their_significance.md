Ukrainian forces have been launching [[Ukrainian attacks on Russian fuel depots | attacks on Russian refineries]] and other energy infrastructure, marking a significant evolution in the ongoing conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. These strikes aim to disrupt Russia's war machine and economy.

## Shifting US Stance

For several months, the Biden administration had attempted to dissuade Ukraine from striking Russian oil flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. The administration's concern was that interrupting Russian oil supplies would drive up global oil prices, lead to increased gasoline prices in the United States, and potentially trigger inflation, posing a political issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

However, this logic has been criticized for several reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>:
*   The United States uses very little Russian oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.
*   Any displaced Russian oil can be easily replaced by other producers, such as US shale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.
*   The US gasoline market operates on different dynamics than the global market, meaning short-term price pressure would likely not be sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

Recently, the Biden administration's stance has changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. Two key factors have contributed to this shift:
*   More global oil supplies have come online over the past year, reducing concerns about inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.
*   President Biden's reduced concern about re-election has allowed for a more aggressive approach, effectively "taking the gloves off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.

## Targets and Impact

With the changed policy, Ukraine has launched more extensive attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. The largest aerial drone assault of the war to date involved hitting 15 different facilities almost 1,000 kilometers inside Russia on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.

The primary targets of these [[Impact of Ukrainian strikes on Russian energy infrastructure | Ukrainian strikes]] are **fractionating columns** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>. These are critical pieces of equipment used to split crude oil into various product sets, from bitumen for roads to high-end LPGs like propane and butane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>. Russia lacks the domestic capacity to build these columns, and Chinese alternatives are often of poor quality or rely on Western components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>.

The significance of targeting fractionating columns extends beyond disrupting fuel supply:
*   **Economic Disruption** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>: Repairing these columns requires a supply chain that must circumvent sanctions, significantly slowing the [[Economic implications for Russia due to Ukrainian attacks | Russian economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.
*   **Military Impact** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>: A more critical impact is on the production of high-end chemicals, such as hydrazine and other advanced compounds essential for rocket propellant and explosives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. By targeting these, Ukraine is going after advanced components vital for the [[Russian strategies and developments in the Ukraine war | Russian war machine]], particularly in explosives and artillery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.

While Russia can import these materials if necessary, they have traditionally been a major exporter of such compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>. Chinese production, though possible, is located on the distant southeast coast of China, making transport challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. If a significant amount of Russian refining capacity goes offline, the full impact may not be immediate, but in a few months, the [[Russian strategies and developments in the Ukraine war | Russian war machine]] could face substantial shortages of components needed to produce weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>.

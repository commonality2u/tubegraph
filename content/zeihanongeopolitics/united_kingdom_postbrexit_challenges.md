The United Kingdom faces significant decisions regarding its future in a "post-American world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The nation is grappling with long-standing economic vulnerabilities and evolving [[security_concerns_of_the_united_kingdom | security concerns]], all compounded by the aftermath of Brexit.

## Economic Challenges

The British economic system did not fully adapt after the end of its Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Historically, the UK focused on high-value-added production while importing raw materials and basic manufactured goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. When the Empire concluded and the UK joined Europe, it essentially swapped one reliance for another, depending on the European continent for essential items like foodstuffs, wood products, and automotive parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Unlike other former imperial powers, the UK never fully transitioned its economic model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This has left the UK in a difficult position following Brexit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Security Concerns

As an island nation, the UK's primary security concern has always been the development of navies by other countries that could enable an invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This has led to historical suspicion, bordering on outright fear, towards major powers on the Eurasian landmass, including Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, and Napoleonic France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. While concerned about military powers, the UK also dislikes non-military superpowers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Consequently, proposals for an "ever closer Union" or a common defense identity within the European Union make the UK "squeamish," preferring to keep security matters within NATO where it holds veto power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Demographic Context

The European Union faces significant [[demographic_and_economic_challenges_in_europe | demographic challenges]], with major powers like Germany and Italy projected to age into obsolescence within a decade, and most other EU countries within two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. While the UK's demography is not "super healthy," it is considered the second healthiest within the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The idea of Brexit, debated a decade ago, was partly driven by a desire to get ahead of the EU's economic decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. However, seven years post-Brexit, the UK still lacks a clear policy for its new global role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Post-Brexit Options

The UK fundamentally has two main choices for its future economic and security strategy:

### Option 1: Forging a New "Empire" or Global Trade Node

Since the UK failed to adapt its economy post-imperial era, one option is to seek a new "Empire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This would involve cutting a series of trade deals with countries that possess young demographics and can supply raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. However, replicating the success of the historical British Empire is virtually impossible in the current global climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The Empire's dominance in the 18th and 19th centuries stemmed from being in the early stages of the industrial era, leveraging an "order of magnitude greater economic intensity" and "three orders of magnitude better power projection of military technologies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Today, a mid-sized power like the UK cannot conquer nations like India with a small contingent of people, nor can it force other countries to accept British preeminence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. While not entirely impossible, it is "difficult to see enough country signing on to the idea of British preeminence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Option 2: Partnering with the United States

The second, and more likely, option is to partner with a single large, wealthy country that has more favorable [[demographic_trends_impacting_the_uk | demographic structures]] and shares the UK's [[security_concerns_of_the_united_kingdom | security concerns]] about a united Eurasia as a military power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The only country that fulfills these criteria is the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

However, a trade deal with the US is not a simple "waltz" into Washington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. The United States is very specific in its trade deals, generally avoiding systems that could meaningfully compete with its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This would require the UK to accede to American demands across various sectors, including agriculture, finance, and manufacturing, potentially even adopting the imperial measurement system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Previous UK administrations, including those of Boris Johnson and Theresa May, walked away from trade deal discussions after learning the conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## The Inevitable Outcome

The UK is currently in a "netherworld" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. While quietly acknowledging the need to align with the US for future economic functionality, the associated "hit to their economy will be real and the hit to their ego will be massive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Alternative solutions, such as building a new system or rejoining the EU, are not considered functional long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

Ultimately, it is anticipated that the UK will accept becoming a subsidiary of the American system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This choice will mean the UK loses its cherished freedom to act and its agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Despite the difficult implications for the British mindset, this path is seen as the "best game in town" from both an economic and security perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

Despite common discussions, some factors, like a candidate's age or the vice presidential pick, may not significantly alter the outcome of a US presidential [[2024_us_presidential_election_predictions | election]] that features a rematch of previous candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

## The Age Issue
While President Biden is significantly older than previous presidents and would be the oldest president ever if he wins again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>, his opponent, [[potential_issues_with_donald_trumps_influence_in_future_elections | Donald Trump]], would also be the oldest president ever if he were to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. This means that for voters, age is generally not a decisive factor, as both leading candidates share this characteristic, effectively neutralizing it as a unique concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.

## The Vice Presidency
Replacing the vice president, such as [[potential_issues_with_donald_trumps_influence_in_future_elections | Kamala Harris]], is also unlikely to influence voters' decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. While there might be discussions about the effectiveness of a current Vice President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>, replacing them is not expected to change anyone's mind, as voters typically do not cast their ballots based on the vice presidential candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.

The narrative of the [[global_dominance_of_the_us_dollar | US dollar]] being in its final years as the global currency is a recurring conventional wisdom, often tied to significant political developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This perspective, however, consistently lacks accuracy due to an absence of mathematical and historical understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## The BRICS Grouping

Recently, discussions about countries joining the [[brics_summit_and_its_significance | BRICS group]] have fueled speculation about a potential challenge to the [[global_dominance_of_the_us_dollar | US dollar]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
BRICS is an acronym for Brazil, Russia, India, and China, four large developing economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The grouping was initially conceived by a finance professional in the 2000s simply to suggest these countries had large bond markets worth considering for group trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

Despite occasional meetings among their leaders, the BRICS nations have not produced any meaningful policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. A primary reason for this lack of cohesive action is that these countries do not significantly trade with one another, though they all trade with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
The recent talks of [[expansion_of_brics_and_potential_implications | other countries like South Africa, Argentina, or Saudi Arabia joining]] are considered uninteresting because these nations also share little in common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This highlights the [[internal_conflicts_and_diverse_interests_within_brics | internal conflicts and diverse interests within BRICS]].

## Challenges of Establishing Alternative Global Currencies

For countries to stop using the [[global_dominance_of_the_us_dollar | US dollar]], they would need a viable alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. However, no BRICS nation is willing to use another member's currency, as this would grant that country an advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. For instance, Russia's suggestion of the ruble as a global currency is not taken seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The same applies to the Chinese Yuan, South African Rand, and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Misconceptions About IMF SDRs
There's an idea of a jointly managed currency, possibly based on the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. However, SDRs are not a currency or even a unit of exchange; they are an accounting fiction used to manage funds from multiple countries flowing into the IMF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. To manage global trade, SDRs would need to expand by a factor of at least a thousand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Requirements for a Global Currency
The [[challenges_of_establishing_alternative_global_currencies | requirements for a global currency]] are extensive:
*   **Immense Scale**: It must be massive enough to facilitate global exchange mechanisms, which involve tens of trillions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. The currency itself would need to be even larger than the trade volume it lubricates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Indifference to Value Fluctuations**: The issuing country must be largely unconcerned with daily fluctuations in the currency's value caused by trade surges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Persistent Trade Deficit**: The issuing country must be able to run a persistent trade deficit to provide currency for global transactions without individually approving each one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

This last point eliminates most contenders:
*   **Europe**: The Euro cannot be a global currency because European demographics necessitate running a trade surplus, meaning they will never be net importers again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **China**: The Chinese Yuan is the most manipulated currency in history, with China printing significantly more currency monthly than the US Federal Reserve did during its peak monetization programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Every time China attempts to loosen capital controls to promote the Yuan internationally, hundreds of billions of dollars in private savings flee the country, forcing them to reimpose controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## Historical Context of Global Currencies

The [[historical_context_of_global_currencies | need for a large, liquid, and stable currency]] maintained by a country indifferent to its daily fluctuations is crucial to global trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   Even during intense British-Spanish conflicts in the late Colonial period, the British primarily used Spanish currency to lubricate their slave, rum, and finished goods trade triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   During the height of the Vietnam War, the Vietnamese used the [[global_dominance_of_the_us_dollar | US dollar]] for international exchange due to a lack of other options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   More recently, Russia, under financial sanctions, attempted to convert petroleum earnings from Euros and Dollars into Chinese Yuan. A few months later, when they tried to withdraw these funds, China was unwilling to take back the Yuan, leading to Russia losing tens of billions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

There is no historical example of the global trade unit of exchange being anything other than the currency of the global hegemon and largest economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Even the Americans, during the War of 1812, used the British Pound as their internal unit of exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

## The Future of International Currency and Global Trade

As the world potentially [[potential_global_economic_impact_and_the_future_of_international_currency | de-globalizes]] and trade shifts to regional blocs, the [[global_dominance_of_the_us_dollar | US dollar's position]] is likely to become even more entrenched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Regional hegemons will attempt to impose their own currencies, but other countries in their neighborhood will prefer not to use them due to the hegemon's potential for manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. The [[global_dominance_of_the_us_dollar | US dollar]], being more liquid, less politically problematic, stable, and not actively manipulated for trade advantages, will remain the preferred alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Example: The Lira
> In the Eastern Mediterranean, Turkey may try to compel its neighbors in the Caucuses, Middle East, and Balkans to use the Lira <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. However, these countries will be reluctant, knowing Turkey would use its currency's authority to bind their economies more closely to its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

Ultimately, speculation about the dethroning of the [[global_dominance_of_the_us_dollar | US dollar]] continues to surface due to anti-American sentiments and a lack of understanding of financial principles and history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This narrative remains as insignificant today as it has been in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

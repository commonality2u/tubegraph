The Federal Reserve's monetary policy is under scrutiny as inflation remains elevated and expectations for rate cuts have not materialized. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, ticked up to 2.7% on April 26th, 2024, defying hopes for a decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This contrasts sharply with Wall Street's earlier predictions of numerous rate cuts by this point in the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Inflationary Pressures

Much of the recent inflation is attributed to COVID-19 related disruptions. Shifts in consumption patterns due to openings, closings, new variants, or vaccines necessitated retooling supply chains to match new demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Supply chains typically require an 18 to 24-month adjustment period to catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. While inflation has steadily decreased from its 9% peak, settling closer to 3% as supply chains normalize, it is unlikely to reach the Fed's 2% target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This suggests that the current inflation level might be a "new normal" for inflation lows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Federal Reserve's Stance

The Federal Reserve appears uninterested in catering to Wall Street's preferred narrative of rate cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The Fed views Wall Street as having been "fairly irresponsible" with large capital inflows, pointing to the dot-com and subprime crashes that required a decade to rebuild the financial sector after each catastrophe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Consequently, the Fed does not believe that what Wall Street deems necessary for its business plans is necessarily beneficial for the U.S. or "real" economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

## Demographic Shifts and Capital Availability

A significant factor influencing monetary policy is demographic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>:
*   **Capital-Rich Period:** Individuals aged 45 to 65 are typically the most capital-rich, saving for retirement, paying down mortgages, and earning their highest incomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This group's savings are the primary source of private capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Baby Boomer Impact:** The Baby Boomers, the largest generation in human history, significantly influenced global capital availability. The oldest Baby Boomers reached 45 in 1990, and the youngest will turn 65 by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. From roughly 2000 to 2020, most Baby Boomers were in their capital-rich years, leading to unprecedented capital availability and low capital costs globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This period saw the rise of a financial class developing new products to manage and deploy this vast capital, much of it abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **China's Role:** Concurrently, China experienced a similar period of economic boom from 2000 to 2020, characterized by significant "monetization" (currency printing), contributing to the global capital surplus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Current Decline:** The vast majority of Baby Boomers are now retired or will be in the next 5-6 years, converting their savings into low-velocity investments like T-bills and cash, meaning their "free capital" is gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Future Generations:** Generation X is a smaller generation, and the next large generation, Millennials, will not enter their capital-rich period for another 10 to 12 years, and they are typically delaying major life milestones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

The consequence is significantly less free capital available, reducing the need for an equally large financial sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Deglobalization and Future Outlook

The Fed is now operating under a new model where the financial sector is not considered "all-knowing, all-seeing, and omnipresent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. In an era of deglobalization, the U.S. is increasingly disentangling itself from global supply chains, leading to a skyrocket in demand for American employment, capital, and materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. This requires building new industrial plants and infrastructure, absorbing significant resources and driving inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. While this is productive inflation, building infrastructure for the next generation, it will continue to fuel demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

Until the Federal Reserve's mandate changes or a new large capital-generating class emerges, interest rates are unlikely to drop and may even increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The prevailing expectation of "higher for longer" means potentially another decade before "appreciable relief in capital costs" is seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Even with increased capital costs today, they remain the cheapest they will be until the mid-2030s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

China is currently facing a "triple economic funk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, indicating significant [[chinas_economic_strategies_and_challenges | economic challenges]] that have persisted since the COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike many other nations, China has not experienced the anticipated surge in consumption following the declared end of the epidemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Post-COVID Economic Performance

Despite expectations of a return to normalcy, China's economic indicators show a distinct lack of recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>:
*   **Reduced Growth**: Growth is lower now than it was during the periods of complete lockdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Decreased Consumption**: Overall consumption is down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Trade Decline**: Both imports and exports dropped by double-digit percentages in July compared to the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This level of decline is typically seen in countries like Ukraine or Russia during wartime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Underlying Demographic Issues

A significant contributing factor to China's economic woes is a [[chinas_demographic_challenges | demographic bomb]] that began impacting the economy even before COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Birth Rate Decline**: From 2017 to 2021, China's birth rate fell by approximately 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Pre-COVID Indicators**: New car sales, a key indicator of consumer confidence and future spending, had already turned negative even in the months leading up to the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a> and have not recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **One-Child Policy Impact**: The one-child policy, now over 40 years old, has resulted in a generation of people who did not have children, leading to a significant lack of individuals in their 20s and 30s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. These age groups are typically responsible for the majority of consumption in a modern system, including buying cars, raising children, and building homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## The Threat of Deflation

Unlike most of the developing world, which experienced a burst of inflation post-COVID due to increased consumption, China is facing deflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Causes of Deflation**:
    *   **Reduced Confidence**: People are less confident in their future, leading to reduced consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
    *   **Trade Wars**: Mounting trade wars with Europe, Japan, the United States, and increasingly secondary states like South Korea, mean China has fewer places to export goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
    *   **Oversupply**: Products normally produced for export are trapped within the Chinese system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This oversupply of goods combined with under-demand both domestically and internationally drives prices down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Deflationary Spiral**: While a short burst of deflation isn't necessarily a major issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, the current situation aligns with what would be expected at the beginning of a deflationary spiral caused by a fundamental mismatch between supply and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This mismatch is exacerbated by deglobalization and China's irreversible [[chinas_demographic_challenges | demographic trends]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Comparison to Japan**: Japan experienced a major deflationary period starting in the late 1990s, which lasted for 20 to 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Once prices begin to drop due to this supply-demand mismatch, it becomes "devilishly hard" to adjust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Ineffectiveness of Investment-Driven Growth

Traditionally, China's economic growth has been driven by state-fostered mass borrowing for investment in industrial plant and infrastructure, accounting for 40% to 70% of its economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. However, this model has reached its limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **Diminishing Returns**: The amount of growth generated per Yuan spent has been steadily declining for 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a> and is now less than one-to-one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. This means additional capital pumped into the system no longer generates more economic activity than its cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Past Saturation**: China likely reached the point where it no longer needed more bridges or factories before COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

## Outlook and Challenges

China's current situation is compared to Japan's economic stagnation in the late 1990s and early 2000s, where Japan's economic model could no longer generate positive returns on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. However, China faces even greater [[challenges_facing_chinas_future | challenges]]:
*   **Economic Disparity**: The average Chinese citizen's income today, inflation-indexed, is only about a quarter or a fifth of the average Japanese citizen's income in the year 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This means China is entering a "permanent recession" and deflationary spiral long before becoming rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Lack of Solutions**: Japan had several advantages that China lacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>:
    *   An established global supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
    *   Global allies and options for offshoring manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
    *   Strong demand from the United States and a good political relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
    *   Already being a wealthy nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Political System**: China's political system, which is largely centralized around one individual, significantly limits the state's capacity to develop creative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Even in Japan, where public discussion was allowed, it took a generation to recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

This recent data, while only one month's worth, is seen as the belated manifestation of underlying demographic and geopolitical trends that have been developing for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. If this trend continues, the situation is expected to worsen significantly in a relatively short period, as years of "compressed damage" are now bursting out simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

The shifting global order and the [[Shift in US global strategic role | US reevaluation of its global position]] raise questions about the future for small countries worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. As the US strategic relationship with the post-Cold War global order changes, nations must adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Japan's Model for Engagement

Japan is highlighted as the country that has successfully navigated the [[shifts_in_us_foreign_policy_and_its_implications | changing US approach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. A few governments ago, Japanese leaders realized that the Americans were "losing interest in everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Given Japan's dependence on [[Impact of US withdrawal on global trade | international trade]] for its economic health, especially for energy imports, they understood the necessity of securing their future by engaging with the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

Unlike the Cold War era, where the United States provided economic and strategic concessions to build alliances, the current environment requires countries to actively offer something to keep the US involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Japan achieved this by offering [[Impact of US withdrawal on global trade | trade concessions]] and a security partnership on America's terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

For smaller countries less capable than Japan, this need for proactive engagement is "triple true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. They will need to be "a lot more aggressive and a lot more giving" to maintain American interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## New Zealand's Unique Position

New Zealand, situated "off the edge of the Earth," does not face the same immediate security concerns as many other nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. For New Zealand, the primary interest will be economic, as they produce essential agricultural products for the global market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This provides "an easier carry" for engagement, even before considering cultural connections with America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Broader Challenges for Global Engagement

For most of the world, offering something of interest to the United States is a "much taller order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The US is not interested in many things, requiring countries to "get really creative and dig really deep" to keep the Americans engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Red Sea Operations as a Placeholder

The US Navy's actions in the Red Sea against the Houthi rebels are seen as a "placeholder" rather than a return to the US's previous global role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. These operations have revealed the limitations of American naval interdiction capacities against widespread, non-state attacks, stretching the Navy to its breaking point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This demonstrates that the US cannot unilaterally police global oceans against modern technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### Disengagement from the Middle East

The idea of the United States being "sucked back into the Middle East" is unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. The Gaza conflict has underscored to the US its desire to disengage from the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

A "fun little conversation" is occurring with the Israelis, similar to past discussions with European allies about Russian aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. While the US publicly stated its intention to withdraw from the Middle East, Israel reportedly assumed this meant a reinforced alliance with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. However, the Gaza War has reinforced the US's distaste for involvement, making it clear that supporting Israeli government objectives in a prolonged conflict is not a viable strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Recent discussions on arms transfers are forcing Israel to realize it is not a "special exception" that will keep the US involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

A "dawning revelation" is occurring globally, one country at a time, that the United States is no longer the same global player it was 20 years ago, and is looking to become a "free agent" again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

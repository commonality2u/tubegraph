The current [[deglobalization_and_its_impact_on_american_industry | deglobalization]] trend is considered to have passed the point of no return, driven by shifts in American foreign policy priorities, domestic politics, and global demographic changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Historical Context: The US Role in Globalization

Initially, [[Globalization ending and regional strategies | globalization]] was not primarily an economic strategy for the United States, but rather a security one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Post-World War II, the U.S. had the world's largest economy, while potential rivals and allies combined had an economy of similar size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Economic growth was difficult, and security was elusive due to competition over resources and land, which historically colored human conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

Facing the Soviet Union, the U.S. determined it could not sustain a distant conflict economically or politically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The solution was to offer allies economic incentives: the U.S. Navy would patrol global oceans, ensuring access to materials and, crucially, the American market, which was the only significant economy to survive the war intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. In return, allies had to allow the U.S. to dictate their security policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This strategy successfully ended the Cold War, as the Soviet system could not compete with the economically powerful alliance the U.S. created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. By the 1980s, South Korea, once among the world's poorest countries, surpassed the Soviet Union in per capita terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Evolution of the Global System and US Perspective

Over the past 30-35 years, the world entered an era of "hyper [[Globalization ending and regional strategies | globalization]]" where many new players like Southeast Asia, Brazil, India, Russia, and China joined the global system under U.S.-established rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. However, the U.S. economy is no longer as large as the rest of the world combined; it is now three or four times smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

The indirect economic subsidization previously offered by the U.S. has become less tenable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Many countries, particularly China, are now overextended and so dependent on [[Globalization ending and regional strategies | globalization]] that they would require increased, rather than decreased, U.S. support to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. China faces specific vulnerabilities due to its demographics (lack of market), limited military reach (difficulty securing energy), and reliance on Russia, a country prone to using raw material supply for geopolitical concessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

The fundamental reason the U.S. no longer benefits from [[Globalization ending and regional strategies | globalization]] in the same way is that it never viewed it primarily as an economic endeavor, unlike other nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## American Politics and Foreign Policy Shifts

During the Cold War, the U.S. maintained a strong bipartisan foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. However, American foreign policy is a reflection of its domestic policy, which undergoes shifts every generation or two as parties redefine themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Changes in demographics, economics, and security (e.g., end of the Cold War, rise and fall of hyper-[[Globalization ending and regional strategies | globalization]], Baby Boomer retirement, information revolution, social media) have fundamentally altered American politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

These shifts have fractured traditional political alliances:
*   Unions have largely left the Democratic coalition, drawn partly by the Trump Coalition, and are very anti-free trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   The Trump Administration pushed the business community and National Security conservatives, historically pro-[[Globalization ending and regional strategies | globalization]] factions, out of the Republican coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

Consequently, both the Biden Administration and the Trump-led Republican coalition are now vying for union support, leading to a political environment where no one in Washington wants to discuss [[Globalization ending and regional strategies | globalization]] in a positive light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. The groups that previously favored [[Globalization ending and regional strategies | globalization]] (national security and business conservatives) are no longer influential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

The Biden Administration is considered more anti-[[Globalization ending and regional strategies | globalization]] than the Trump Administration, actively embedding anti-[[Globalization ending and regional strategies | globalization]] policies into long-term American policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Even if a future president were a strong globalist, it would take years to unwind eight years of anti-[[Globalization ending and regional strategies | globalization]] sentiment and another eight years of strategic apathy under the Obama administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

## Global Demographic Shifts

One of the most significant factors driving [[deglobalization_and_its_impact_on_american_industry | deglobalization]] is [[Global demographic shifts and future economic implications | global demographic shifts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Urbanization and industrialization, which began for the rich world 75 years ago and the developing world 40 years ago, lead to smaller family sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. In urban environments, children transition from being free labor to expensive liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

This trend means the world is running out of people aged 20 and under (for 20 years now) and, increasingly, people aged 40 and under <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. The core concept of trade and [[Globalization ending and regional strategies | globalization]] relies on consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. However, the demographic cohorts that traditionally do most of the consuming—people 45 and under who are having children and buying homes and cars—no longer exist in sufficient numbers to sustain the globalized system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

Societies are aging at unprecedented rates:
*   China and Russia are the fastest aging societies in human history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   Germany and Korea are not far behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   Indonesia, India, and Brazil are aging faster than most of the developing world did over the past 70 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

By 2040-2045, the average American will be younger than the average Brazilian, and ten years later, younger than the average Indian, Indonesian, or Mexican <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. This demographic shift fundamentally undermines the economic basis for [[Globalization ending and regional strategies | globalization]] due to a shrinking consumer base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

## Conclusion

The convergence of these factors—a lack of American interest in supporting [[Globalization ending and regional strategies | globalization]] for security reasons, insufficient young people globally to sustain consumption, and a political moment in the U.S. that actively undermines [[Globalization ending and regional strategies | globalization]]—provides more than enough time to dismantle the globalized system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

For the U.S. to re-engage in [[Global Economic System Transformation | global economic system transformation]], a significant security scare that uniquely impacts America more than the rest of the world would be necessary, compelling the U.S. to pay for a new alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. The Ukraine war, however, has not served as such a catalyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. The Biden Administration's deals focus solely on security, without any "guns for butter" trade components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. In fact, most tariffs initiated by the Trump Administration have been doubled or tripled by the Biden Administration, with only one exception (Aerospace with Europeans) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

The current trajectory indicates a deepening of [[deglobalization_and_its_impact_on_american_industry | deglobalization]], making a return to a globally integrated system unlikely in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

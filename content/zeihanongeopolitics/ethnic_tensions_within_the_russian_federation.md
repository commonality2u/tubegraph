The March 2024 terror attack in Moscow, claimed by Islamic State Khorasan (ISK), highlights existing ethnic and political tensions within the Russian Federation, particularly among its non-ethnic Russian populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

## Diverse Ethnic Landscape
Russia's population includes numerous ethnic groups, many of whom are Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Well over 10% of the Russian population is Muslim, and republics on Russia's southern border are predominantly Muslim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Ethnic groups such as the Chechens, Dagestanis, Tatars, and Bashkirs are among those who may be motivated by such events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

The relationship between Muslims within Russia and those beyond its borders is complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. However, the Russian state often views all these groups as "subject peoples" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

## Potential for Internal Unrest
There are existing anti-Moscow groups throughout Russia's southern periphery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. If these groups become inspired by terror attacks like the one in Moscow, Russia could face a broad-based uprising or ongoing "pinpricks of terror attacks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. This scenario poses a significant challenge to Russia's internal stability and could contribute to [[ethnic_and_political_breakup_scenarios_in_russia | ethnic and political breakup scenarios in Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

## Demographic Factors
Russia's population composition shows that over 20%, and possibly closer to 30%, of its citizens are not ethnic Russian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. The majority of this non-ethnic Russian population consists of Muslims or Ukrainians, who are generally dissatisfied with their current situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

The decision to launch the Ukraine war was partly influenced by Russia's [[demographic_issues_in_russia | demographic issues in Russia]], which are described as "terminal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. Projections indicate that by 2030-2035, Russia may lack enough people in their 20s to sustain a war effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. This situation creates a dynamic where a "rising demographic" (non-ethnic Russians) is developing a "pension for civic violence" against a "declining population" (ethnic Russians) that is desperate to maintain control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

## Impact on Political Stability
Strategic errors by Vladimir Putin in the security field, including misjudging global reactions and interpreting intelligence, are contributing to a head of challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. Such events are expected to impact political stability within the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. While a revolution is not immediately predicted, the system, though strong, is brittle, and attacks like this can create "cracks through the entire facade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

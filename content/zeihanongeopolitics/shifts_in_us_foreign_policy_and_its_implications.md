The global landscape is undergoing a significant transformation as the [[shift_in_us_global_strategic_role | United States]] potentially moves away from its traditional role of maintaining global order. This shift could lead to a world where trade breaks down, and countries are compelled to prioritize their own security and needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## US Policy Shift in the Middle East

The [[us_policy_shift_in_the_middle_east | United States]] is increasingly disinterested in global affairs, especially the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This disinterest forces countries like Israel to either manage their own security or seek alternative security guarantors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Impact on Traditional Alliances

Historically, the [[political_dynamics_and_alliances_in_the_united_states_and_its_implications | United States]] has financially supported countries like Jordan and Egypt for decades to ensure regional stability and prevent issues for Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This aid, however, may cease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

During the Cold War, the [[political_dynamics_and_alliances_in_the_united_states_and_its_implications | United States]] maintained an open Persian Gulf and engaged Saudi Arabia to ensure oil flow to its allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. However, with [[shifts_in_us_energy_independence_and_its_global_implications | US energy independence]], the broader alliance structure is less critical, leading to a gradual withdrawal of support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. The importance of Saudi Arabia to the [[political_dynamics_and_alliances_in_the_united_states_and_its_implications | United States]] has diminished, allowing other issues, such as Saudi Arabia's human rights record and its war in Yemen, to gain prominence on the agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Over the past decade, technical military aid, including training and equipment support, to Saudi Arabia has significantly decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Emergence of New Regional Dynamics

As the [[political_dynamics_and_alliances_in_the_united_states_and_its_implications | United States]] withdraws, regional powers are forming new alliances:

*   **Israel and Turkey**: While relations between Israel and Turkey have been strained, military and intelligence cooperation has steadily increased in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. With the [[political_dynamics_and_alliances_in_the_united_states_and_its_implications | Americans]] becoming less involved, Turkey, as the local naval superior power and holder of NATO's second-largest armor, is an undeniable regional military force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Israel will likely need to align with local military powers like Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

*   **Israel and Saudi Arabia**: Israel has found a new partner in Saudi Arabia, especially in addressing threats from Iran and Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Saudi Arabia provides valuable intelligence on the Shia world and geographical proximity for potential military strikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The Saudis' control over Sunni Muslim holy sites also gives them significant credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Relations have warmed, leading to a decrease in transnational attacks and diplomatic condemnations against Israel by the Arab League <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. While formal recognition is pending, intelligence sharing and collaboration in third countries are already robust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Crucially, the Saudis view the Israelis as more reliable than the [[political_dynamics_and_alliances_in_the_united_states_and_its_implications | Americans]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Israel has even stepped in to provide military aid and know-how to Riyadh, filling the void left by American reduction in support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

## Potential Geopolitical Shifts

This [[potential_geopolitical_shifts | geopolitical shift]] sets the stage for a potential major military conflict in the Persian Gulf this decade, primarily between Iran on one side, and Saudi Arabia, strongly backed by Israel, on the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Turkey may also play a wildcard role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. This region is likely to experience significant instability and dramatic events for an extended period, as the involved countries possess the financial capacity and geographical insulation to sustain prolonged conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Israel's role will be critical in determining Saudi Arabia's success in such a conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

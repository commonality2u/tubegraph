A Hong Kong court has ruled that China's largest property development group, Evergrande, is bankrupt and must be broken up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This development occurred despite significant efforts by the Chinese government over the past two years to prevent it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Underpinnings of the Chinese Economy

Two major factors dominate the [[challenges_in_the_chinese_economy | Chinese economy]] that led to this situation:

### Hyperfinancialization
This concept describes how the government de facto confiscates citizens' savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. These savings can only be invested in projects funded by [[chinese_banking_system_and_nonperforming_loans | Chinese State Banks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The money supply is massively expanded, to almost triple that of the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, ensuring abundant cash for banks to lend any amount at low terms to anyone at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The goal is expansion and employment, as employed individuals are less likely to pose public stability concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This approach prioritizes political control and throughput over profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Population Savings Behavior
In this system, companies like Evergrande gorge on a bottomless supply of debt to build extensively, even without demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Simultaneously, the population knows their private savings are nearly worthless due to the government forcing them into [[chinese_banking_system_and_nonperforming_loans | State Banks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. People seek hard assets that the state cannot control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. If they cannot move money out of the country, the next best option is property within the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This leads to individuals pooling savings to buy condos, often with each unit owned by a different consortium of private individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

It is estimated that there are approximately 1.5 million housing units in China that have never been, and likely never will be, lived in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This represents a conservative 100% overbuild, with some estimates suggesting it could be as high as three billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Evergrande's Downfall and Immediate Impact
Evergrande's bankruptcy means its debts will no longer be serviced, and its physical assets will be parceled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This opens the door for foreign investors to acquire these assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, actions that the Chinese Communist Party would not normally permit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

There are two potential outcomes for this situation, neither of which is considered favorable:

### Option 1: Western-Style Bankruptcy
If a Western-style bankruptcy and restitution program is followed, Evergrande's system would be broken up, and many of its assets would be sold at pennies or dimes on the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This would reveal the true extent of the oversupply in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. With an estimated 70% of total private savings in China tied up in real estate, and most assets worth no more than 10 cents on the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, a fire sale by the single largest player (controlling one-sixth of the market) would quickly lead to significant public outcry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Option 2: Chinese Government Intervention
The Chinese government could intervene and abrogate the Hong Kong ruling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. While legally impossible, the Chinese Communist Party often disregards legal details concerning Hong Kong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. If this happens, Evergrande would be put on state financial support, allowing the system to limp along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. However, this would signal that Hong Kong lacks legal authority over its own holdings, likely triggering an exodus of the remaining international firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Broader Economic and Demographic Implications

Regardless of the path taken, the market is not expected to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This situation is unlike the 2008 TARP program in the United States, which froze the market, established a floor, and enabled reforms for economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Evergrande's collapse is not an isolated incident; many other development companies operate similarly, engaging in practices like building condos with no demand or running Ponzi schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. The second and third largest players in the industry are state-owned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, indicating the Chinese government is unlikely to abandon the old model for something sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

### Demographic Challenges
Even if economic reforms were implemented, it is too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Legitimate housing demand, primarily from individuals aged 20 to 45 who are starting out, is severely impacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. The combination of the one-child policy, instituted 45 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, and rapid urbanization, means there are no longer enough people under 45 to drive consumption-led activities, including home buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Outlook
There is no clear market-based path out of this crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The [[potential_collapse_of_chinese_economy_and_governance | market economics are atrocious and worsening]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, and the government is increasingly nervous about the [[challenges_in_the_chinese_economy | state of the economy]] and its population's loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. This situation strikes at the core of what enables the average citizen to support the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, suggesting significant collateral damage moving forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

The American Southwest is currently experiencing a [[water_scarcity_in_the_american_southwest | water problem]] and drought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This region has a long history of mass extinctions and civilizational breakdown events, some of which have led to cannibalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Geographic Factors Contributing to Aridity

The terrain of the Southwest is arid with significant elevation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Most of its water comes from orographic precipitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This process occurs when moisture moving across a landscape hits an elevation, rises, and if temperatures at higher elevations are cold enough, the water condenses into vapor, forms clouds, and precipitates as rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Most rainfall in the American Southwest originates this way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

However, orographic precipitation is fickle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. It often lacks sufficient cold temperatures at elevation or humid air currents to generate moisture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This means rivers literally come and go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, a phenomenon that has historically caused the collapse of civilizational systems during "megadroughts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The region is currently in one of these megadrought periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## The Colorado River Compact

Recognizing limited water resources, the states in the American Southwest established a legal structure called the [[issues_with_the_colorado_river_compact | Colorado River Compact]] in 1922 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This compact was designed to share the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Flaws in the Compact's Foundation
A major flaw in the compact is that the year used to evaluate water availability for sharing was one of the wettest on record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Consequently, it has been known for decades that the water volumes specified in the treaty would not be consistently available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Senior Water Rights
The compact also established a system of senior water rights, heavily litigated and legalized at the federal level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Urban centers existing at the time of the treaty (1922) were granted priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Any infrastructure built to access the waterway network since then is at a lower priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

California, the first state mentioned in the compact, had the highest population then and now, granting it senior water rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Los Angeles alone has 15 million people, which was the total population of the entire Southwest in 1922 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Arizona, having finished its Central Arizona Project in the late 1960s and 1970s, holds the lowest priority among the junior water rights holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

A Supreme Court ruling affirmed California's senior water rights over Arizona, meaning Arizona's water demand can be cut to zero before California has to make any cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This ruling has led California to refuse negotiations with other states in the Colorado River Basin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

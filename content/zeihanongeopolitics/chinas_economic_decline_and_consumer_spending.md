From: [[zeihanongeopolitics]] <br/> 

Information out of China through July, August, and September has been "atrocious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This includes:

*   Consumer spending being down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   Lending is down, which is unusual for a capitally-driven country like China, where lending should always be increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   Youth unemployment data is "atrocious," leading to the cessation of data collection altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   Information on bond transactions is no longer available, hindering the development of a sustainable economic structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   Data on patents is no longer collected, indicating that the long-standing goal of moving up the "value-added scale" is no longer part of the plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

These issues contribute to a perceived broad-scale societal, economic, and political breakdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Why the Sudden Realization?

While the current situation may seem like a sudden shock after years of hearing about a "rising China," many of these issues have been developing for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The sudden awareness stems from two main factors: external global preoccupations and internal Chinese policies.

### External Distractions
For the past few years, the global community has been largely preoccupied with its own issues, such as:
*   The Ukraine War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   Iranian conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   The Trump Administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   The Biden Administration's internal focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   The tail end of the European financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   Japan's remilitarization program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

It is only now that the "noise out of China" has become too loud to ignore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### Internal Chinese Factors
Internally, two significant factors obscured the developing crisis:

#### COVID-19 as a Cover
For three years, COVID-19 was cited as the reason for any negative statistical releases or news from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Problems like declining consumption, supply chain issues, and difficulties linking industrial production to global demand were attributed to the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. This allowed China to deflect attention from underlying structural issues, and the world is only now getting a clearer picture post-COVID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

#### Xi Jinping's Purges and Information Vacuum
Chairman Xi Jinping initiated a series of purges under the guise of an anti-corruption campaign, which has created an "information vacuum" across China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   In his first five years, he removed every regional power center to prevent them from rising to national prominence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   He then "gutted" the factions of previous presidents, Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   More recently, he has purged bureaucrats and the private sector of anyone who might achieve national prominence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   As part of this, certain data collection has been removed to prevent potential rivals from using economic or political routes to prominence. Examples include college dissertation information (possibly no longer collected) and state-compiled political biographies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## [[Chinas Demographic and Economic Challenges | Demographic Collapse]] as an Inflection Point
The high point of the Chinese system, largely demographic, occurred about five or six years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Recent data released by China indicates that the birth rate has dropped by nearly 70% since 2017, the fastest drop in recorded human history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. The Shanghai Academy of Sciences suggests China may have overcounted its population by over 100 million people, all of whom would have been working-age (under 40) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This means [[Chinese demographic decline and its impacts | China hit peak workforce]] years ago, likely in the earlier part of the last five or six years, and now lacks enough millennials for consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. The cost of the workforce has also increased by a factor of 14 or 15 in the last 22 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

This [[Chinese demographics and population collapse | demographic collapse]] is uncorrectable due to a lack of people under age 40, even if macroeconomic structures encouraged larger families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Broader Economic Challenges
Beyond demographics, [[challenges_in_the_chinese_economy | China faces increasing rates of decline]] in industrial competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. The country is also becoming more exposed to energy and food insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a> due to thin infrastructure for Russian supplies, requiring long and exposed supply lines via sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

The Biden Administration is noted as the most protectionist U.S. administration in a century, even more so than Donald Trump, further impacting China's ability to trade and export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. [[Chinas economic dependency on exports | China is being hit from every angle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Chairman Xi's purges have left the system so devoid of decision-making capacity that it's questionable if he can even become aware of problems or develop coherent policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

## Outlook and Global Impact
[[chinas_potential_collapse_and_its_impact_on_global_industry | China's final decade as a coherent economic power]] was already projected due to demographics, but political failures and external pressures could accelerate this decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. The concern is whether the world has enough time to adapt to [[chinas_postcovid_economic_challenges | China's economic decline]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

While reshoring and industrial expansion in countries like the United States have increased significantly (even surpassing World War II levels for industrial projects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, many critical industrial components like transmission towers and transformers are still made in China, with waitlists exceeding 36 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. The "information vacuum" and "collapsed decision-making capacity" within China, combined with the rapid pace of decline, mean that the world might not realize China is "broken" until products simply stop arriving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. This could lead to significant shortages and "follow-on damage" globally, particularly if industrial plant expansion outside China isn't fast enough to compensate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

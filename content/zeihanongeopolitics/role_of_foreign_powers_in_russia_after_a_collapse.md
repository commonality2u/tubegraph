From: [[zeihanongeopolitics]] <br/> 

The collapse of Russia is not anticipated to occur in the current decade, but demographic issues and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine suggest a potential future collapse within a lifetime, likely following a political break and leadership struggle in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. This future scenario raises questions about the role of foreign powers in the post-Russian space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

## Military Technology and Assets
In the aftermath of a Russian collapse, the transferability of [[technology_and_military_assets_in_postcollapse_russia | Russian military technology]] to other powers is expected to be very limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. Russia's capacity to produce advanced military technology at scale has been shown to be "woefully lacking" during the Ukraine war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

*   **China**: The Chinese military is not considered sophisticated enough to copy Russia's more advanced military technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:44">[02:06:44]</a>.
*   **European Nations**: Countries with the necessary technical skills, such as Poland, Ukraine, the Czech Republic, and Hungary, prefer to work with Western technology due to its superior effectiveness, advancement, range, and lethality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.
*   **Depleted Stockpiles**: Russia is consuming its available military hardware in the Ukraine war, meaning there will not be a large stock of modern war material for other nations to acquire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

## Economic Implications
The Russian industrial plant is widely inefficient and understaffed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. Foreign powers are unlikely to engage with it as personnel would prefer better technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

### Skilled Labor and Intelligence
After a collapse, a significant number of skilled Russian individuals, including those with advanced degrees and from intelligence services, are expected to leave the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. This phenomenon was observed after the Soviet collapse when approximately 10 million Russians with advanced degrees left the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. However, the impact will be less dramatic this time due to the [[collapse_of_russian_technical_expertise_and_economic_implications | Russian educational system's collapse]], resulting in a much smaller pool of technically skilled individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.
Former intelligence agents may also go into business for themselves, as was seen in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. However, the current pool of Russian security personnel is more akin to "thugs" than sophisticated technocrats, lacking signals intelligence skills or global connections, limiting their potential impact on international criminal enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

### Natural Resources
Russia's vast natural resources, including nickel, palladium, platinum, gold, and oil, are located in remote areas requiring significant infrastructure and maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. The infrastructure needed for extraction requires substantial Industrial Age maintenance, which Russia has struggled to perform itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. Furthermore, production relies on Western technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.

*   **China**: China has previously purchased drilling rigs and resold them as secondhand materials to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>.
*   **"Neo-Colony" Scenario**: For a foreign power to leverage Russian mineral production, it would need to "come in with capital, with technology, with security, and run basically a neo-colony" in some of the world's harshest operating environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. This is considered highly difficult, especially for resources deep within Russia that depend on internal Russian supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. Only resources on the extremities, such as Sakhalin Island or select areas in East Siberia, might remain functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>.

### Agriculture
A significant portion of Russian agriculture (20% of "Enterprise Farms") is dependent on international supply chains for Western equipment, technology, and inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>. If Russia's breakdown prevents access to these inputs, these productive farms would cease to function optimally, leading to a significant drop in food production capacity and distribution issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.

## Ethnic and Political Breakup
The [[ethnic_and_political_breakup_scenarios_in_russia | breakup of Russia]] would likely see non-ethnic Russian minority groups attempt to gain independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>. These groups are particularly significant if they are near a border with a foreign sponsor or control key infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>.

### Turkic Minorities and Turkey
*   **Tatars and Bashkirs**: These Turkic minorities, located northwest of Kazakhstan, control connecting infrastructure between Russia and Siberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>. They also possess their own energy reserves and the technical knowledge to produce and process them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>. Unlike many Russian technical workers, their skilled personnel remained after the Soviet collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>.
*   **Caucasus and Turkey**: Turkey is a key country to watch in the Caucasus region, especially concerning Turkic minorities like the Chechens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>. Turkey was active in sponsoring the First and Second Chechen Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>, and it is likely to expand its sphere of influence into the Caucasus should central power in Moscow weaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>.

### Finno-Ugric Minorities and Scandinavia/NATO
In Russia's extreme Northwest, Finno-Ugric minorities exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Scandinavian countries like Finland and Sweden, now active members of the [[NATO and regional powers response to Russian influence | Western Alliance]], have emerged as aggressive allies of the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>. These nations possess robust military traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>. It is anticipated that a "new iteration of Scandinavian Vikings" would re-enter the Russian space, potentially to reclaim lost territory, among other actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>. Historically, Vikings founded cities like Kyiv and Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>. The [[russian_involvement_and_tactics | Russian invasion of Ukraine]] has reactivated historical sentiments in Stockholm and Helsinki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>.

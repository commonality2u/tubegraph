The Armenian Lobby in the [[political_dynamics_and_alliances_in_the_united_states_and_its_implications | United States]] is considered very powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Its influence extends beyond cultural ties, deeply embedding itself within the U.S. State Department and Hollywood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

## Historical Context and Impact
The lobby's strength has notably influenced U.S. foreign aid. As a result, the second, third, or fourth largest single component of the USAID budget has often been allocated to Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This allocation was established during the [[history_of_conflict_between_armenia_and_azerbaijan | wars in the 1990s]], even when Armenians were "very clearly the aggressors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. The lobby remains a potent force, particularly in Congress, even today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

## Current Dynamics
With Armenia seeking [[potential_geopolitical_alliances_for_armenia | alternative security guarantors]] due to the [[impact_of_russian_involvement_in_ukraine_on_armenia | bogging down of its traditional Russian ally in Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, a significant dynamic is expected to emerge within [[political_dynamics_and_alliances_in_the_united_states_and_its_implications | U.S. politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

This situation will likely lead to a direct confrontation between the entrenched Armenian Lobby and the entrenched anti-Iranian lobby in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This is because Armenia's potential alignment with Iran, driven by geopolitical necessity, would put these two powerful lobbying groups in diametrically opposed positions on the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Such a scenario exemplifies how domestic and foreign politics can merge in a "delightfully lively" way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

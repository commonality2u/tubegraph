Joaquín Archivaldo Guzmán Loera, commonly known as "El Chapo," was the former leader of the [[sinaloa_cartel_internal_conflict | Sinaloa Cartel]], which became the largest organized crime group in [[cartel_violence_and_structure_in_mexico | Mexico]] under his command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>.

## Leadership Style and Business Acumen

El Chapo's approach to leading the [[sinaloa_cartel_internal_conflict | Sinaloa Cartel]] was unique among organized crime groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. He ran the cartel as a business, rather than simply focusing on power or money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
His methods included:
*   **Best Practices Sharing** El Chapo would gather his chapter leads to compare best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. They focused on efficient ways to transport drugs to the [[influence_of_sinaloa_cartel_in_the_united_states | United States]] with minimal friction and disruption to local law enforcement and populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Community Relations** A core concept was to foster good relations with the local populations where they operated, preventing them from turning against the cartel or seeking government intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Managerial Skills** Although a "murderous thug," he possessed a business degree and managerial experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

This business-oriented approach allowed the [[sinaloa_cartel_internal_conflict | Sinaloa Cartel]] to become the largest drug-running group in [[cartel_violence_and_structure_in_mexico | Mexico]] and the largest organized crime group globally, including within the [[influence_of_sinaloa_cartel_in_the_united_states | United States]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Capture and Imprisonment

Due to his significant success, the [[influence_of_sinaloa_cartel_in_the_united_states | United States]] designated El Chapo as Public Enemy Number One <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Eventually, American law enforcement was able to capture and extradite him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. He is currently serving multiple life sentences within the American prison system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Impact of Capture on the Sinaloa Cartel

El Chapo's imprisonment has had a profound [[impact_of_leadership_change_on_cartel_operations | impact on the Sinaloa Cartel]], leaving his organization in less competent hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. His former underlings, who were once managed by him, began to diverge and pursue their own interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This power vacuum led to an [[sinaloa_cartel_internal_conflict | internal conflict]] described as a "Civil War" within the cartel, particularly in the state of Sinaloa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

The breakdown at the top of the organization has resulted in:
*   **Escalating Violence** The internal fighting among factions, including El Chapo's sons ("Los Chapitos") and Ismael Zambada ("El Mayo"), has led to significant violence, with over 100 murders and numerous abductions reported in Sinaloa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Geographic Spread of Violence** This violence is expected to expand beyond Sinaloa into the rest of [[cartel_violence_and_structure_in_mexico | Mexico]], as local chapters assert their independence and central factions violently attempt to maintain control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Impact on the [[influence_of_sinaloa_cartel_in_the_united_states | United States]]** The conflict has also spread north of the border, affecting local distribution and retail operations of the cartel in the [[influence_of_sinaloa_cartel_in_the_united_states | United States]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Market Disruptions** The organizational breakdown is anticipated to lead to higher drug prices due to interruptions in the distribution system, and increased violence at regional and local levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

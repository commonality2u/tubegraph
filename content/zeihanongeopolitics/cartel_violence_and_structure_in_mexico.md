## Recent Violence in Sinaloa
As of September 22nd, there have been at least 100 murders and numerous abductions in Sinaloa state, northern Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08"> [00:00:08]</a>. This violence is attributed to the [[sinaloa_cartel_internal_conflict | Sinaloa Cartel]] devolving into a civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14"> [00:00:14]</a>.

## The Sinaloa Cartel: A Business Model
The Sinaloa Cartel is distinct among organized crime groups because it operates like a business, rather than solely focusing on power or money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23"> [00:00:23]</a>. Under its former leader, [[el_chapos_leadership_and_capture | El Chapo]] (Joaquín Guzmán Loera), the cartel's chapter leads would meet to compare best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30"> [00:00:30]</a>. The objective was to transport drugs into the [[influence_of_sinaloa_cartel_in_the_united_states | United States]] with minimal friction and disruption to local law enforcement and populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39"> [00:00:39]</a>.

The cartel's philosophy was to maintain good relations with local populations to prevent them from turning against the cartel or seeking government intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47"> [00:00:47]</a>. This strategy allowed the Sinaloa Cartel to become, by far, the largest organized crime group in Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00"> [00:01:00]</a>. While [[el_chapos_leadership_and_capture | El Chapo]] was a "murderous thug," he possessed managerial experience and a business-oriented approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29"> [00:01:29]</a>.

## Leadership Change and Internal Conflict
The success of the Sinaloa Cartel led the United States to designate [[el_chapos_leadership_and_capture | El Chapo]] as Public Enemy Number One <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04"> [00:01:04]</a>. He was eventually captured and extradited by the United States, where he is currently serving multiple life sentences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08"> [00:01:08]</a>.

This [[impact_of_leadership_change_on_cartel_operations | leadership change]] left his organization in less competent hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20"> [00:01:20]</a>. The various factions that [[el_chapos_leadership_and_capture | El Chapo]] once managed have begun to go their own way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37"> [00:01:37]</a>.

The conflict escalated in July when Ismael Zambada, also known as El Mayo, who was formerly the cartel's accountant and had taken over most operations, was arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43"> [00:01:43]</a>. It appears one of [[el_chapos_leadership_and_capture | El Chapo's]] sons betrayed El Mayo, leading to his capture by American law enforcement in Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57"> [00:01:57]</a>. With El Mayo out of the picture, El Chapo's sons (Los Chapitos), who each control their own factions, are now fighting among themselves over his share of the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16"> [00:02:16]</a>.

## Cartel Structure in Mexico
Cartels in Mexico are not monolithic entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27"> [00:02:27]</a>. Due to challenges in internal transport within Mexico, they consist of several dozen mostly locally defined groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33"> [00:02:33]</a>. These local groups may have different names and organizational structures, often only paying "lip service" to the central leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44"> [00:02:44]</a>.

This decentralized system can function when there is a strong ruler who exercises a "light, firm hand" and is skilled at communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54"> [00:02:54]</a>. However, when the primary leader is imprisoned, followed by his deputy, and then the children begin fighting over control, the system breaks down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03"> [00:03:03]</a>. The current breakdown is happening at the very heart of the [[sinaloa_cartel_internal_conflict | Sinaloa Cartel]] organization in Sinaloa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15"> [00:03:15]</a>.

## Consequences of Breakdown
The ongoing [[sinaloa_cartel_internal_conflict | internal conflict]] within the Sinaloa Cartel is expected to expand beyond Sinaloa and into the rest of Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22"> [00:03:22]</a>. Local chapters are likely to assert their independence, leading to violent reactions from the central factions trying to maintain control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31"> [00:03:31]</a>.

The violence is also anticipated to spread north of the border into the [[influence_of_sinaloa_cartel_in_the_united_states | United States]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41"> [00:03:41]</a>. [[el_chapos_leadership_and_capture | El Chapo's]] business-like approach made the Sinaloa Cartel the largest organized crime group globally, including within the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43"> [00:03:43]</a>. As the top leadership fights amongst themselves, local distribution and retail operations (often local gangs) in the U.S. will likely go their own way, resisting control from the Sinaloa leadership factions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55"> [00:03:55]</a>.

This breakdown will likely result in:
*   Higher drug prices due to interruptions in the distribution system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19"> [00:04:19]</a>.
*   Increased violence as the organization breaks down at regional and local levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26"> [00:04:26]</a>.

Australia, a key Western nation, faces significant economic challenges and opportunities as the world undergoes [[global_economic_restructuring_and_its_impacts | global economic restructuring]] and [[global_economic_system_transformation | global economic system transformation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. While facing three major economic hurdles, its strong alliance with the United States provides a unique advantage in a [[postcold_war_global_economic_system | transforming global economic system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Economic Challenges

Australia's economic landscape is marked by three primary concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

### Deep Economic Ties with China

Australia has pursued a two-faced foreign economic policy, being a tight ally of the United States while ruthlessly exploiting economic opportunities offered by the American-led security order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This has led Australia to become deeply economically intertwined with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

As a raw commodities producer, Australia's primary customer for products like bauxite, iron ore, natural gas, and lithium has been China for most of the last 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Chinese demand has been fueled by a "hyper financialization system" that prints money and creates bank deposits to fuel industrial development, often with little regard for economic viability or price sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This allowed China to purchase almost any commodity at any price to further political goals, such as building infrastructure and industrial plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Australia has been arguably the single largest supplier to China throughout this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Future Adjustment
> When this Chinese demand diminishes, Australia will have to sell to more "economically sane folks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. While the market won't collapse, the "balls-to-the-wall price-insensitive expansion" of the past few decades will not continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Demand from the US reindustrialization and Southeast Asia stepping into new roles will not collectively be as large as what China has provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This will lead to a "pretty harsh adjustment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### Failure to Move Up the Value Chain

Australia has consistently remained a raw commodities provider, failing to move up the value-added scale in its industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. For example, they export iron ore but do not produce steel, lithium but not batteries, natural gas but not chemicals, and wheat but not flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Materials are extracted and shipped off, with little to no processing occurring within Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

The industrial plant needed to replace China's processing capacity, currently concentrated in China, should have been developed in Australia decades ago, ideally starting around 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Australia is significantly behind in this regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Only recently, with the US Inflation Reduction Act, has Australia negotiated to join the subsidy regime, allowing some American funds to help build out processing industrial plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This lack of domestic processing capacity means that when China's goes offline, the adjustment will be "a lot worse than it needs to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Unresolved Subprime Mortgage Crisis

Australia has a severe, unresolved subprime mortgage problem that is "much worse" than what the United States experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. While the US forced banks and homeowners to absorb some losses to qualify for federal restitution funds, Australia simply guaranteed everyone's loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. As a result, the problem has festered for the last 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

Conservatively, Australia's subprime problem is "at least a factor of five" worse in relative terms than the US situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. A sharp [[challenges_facing_globalization | de-globalization]] shock or "de-Chinification" would likely be enough to trigger a financial crisis, resulting in something "at least a factor of five worse than what the United States went through with subprime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Economic Outlook
> These three challenges are likely to hit Australia simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The country is not facing a recession but rather a depression that could last half a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This aligns with broader concerns about [[global_recession_dynamics | global recession dynamics]] in a shifting economic order.

## Strategic Advantage: The U.S. Alliance

Despite the significant economic challenges, Australia holds a crucial advantage within the [[future_prospects_for_global_economic_systems | future global economic system]]: its unwavering alliance with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

In a "post-American series" world where the US may step back from maintaining sea lanes and some alliances, Australia is unique in that it will not be dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Australia has consistently proven to be a creative and capable ally, forming international coalitions to unofficially achieve American policy in conflicts like Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. They recognize that their security and economy are dependent on the strategic oversight provided by the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

Australia is one of the very few countries to have received a free trade agreement with the US, granted not for security sacrifices, but because of its long-standing friendship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. In a "post-American world," while the US will be selective about its commitments, Australia is at the very top of its list of allies, even above Japan, Singapore, Canada, and Great Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

No matter how [[globalization_ending_and_regional_strategies | globalization ends]], Australia knows the US will "have their backs" because Australia has the US's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Resilience through Alliance
> Rooted in this free trade relationship with the United States, Australia is expected to grow out of its economic challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Australia possesses commodities that the world, particularly the US, needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. As a creative and capable ally, Australia is expected to apply this capability and creativity to its own [[global_economic_restructuring_and_its_impacts | economic restructuring]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. The key question remains whether they will initiate this process before the anticipated economic downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

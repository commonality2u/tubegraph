Twitter's approach to content moderation has undergone significant changes, particularly following a change in ownership. These shifts have impacted the platform's utility as a source of information and its user engagement.

## Pre-Musk Moderation Efforts
Previously, Twitter was valued for providing access to firsthand information, especially in situations where mainstream media was less present, such as during the Ukraine War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. At the onset of the Ukraine War, the former management of Twitter actively purged Russian bots from the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This action helped open up Twitter, making it a "glorious" venue by reducing the spam of disinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Impact of Elon Musk's Management
With the acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk, the platform's content moderation policies changed drastically. As part of a stated commitment to free speech, all content moderation was reportedly "destroyed," allowing and even encouraging bots to return "in force" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Rise of Misinformation
This policy shift led to a significant increase in [[impact_of_misinformation_on_social_media | misinformation]] on users' feeds. One observer noted that their curated feed became approximately 90-95% misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This change transformed the user experience from easily gaining an understanding of world events to struggling to find any clear information due to overwhelming "crap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Diminished [[interactivity_and_user_engagement_on_twitter | Interactivity]] and Increased Spam
The changes also affected user [[interactivity_and_user_engagement_on_twitter | interactivity]]. Features like the "For You" category, which typically highlights personalized content, seemingly disappeared from feeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. While legitimate interactions decreased dramatically—with one user reporting only seven interactions over six weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>—spam content, such as pornbots and crypto schemes (especially porn-themed ones), continued to bypass moderation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This made using the platform a "time suck and a waste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### [[criticism_of_elon_musks_management_of_twitter | Criticism of Elon Musks management of Twitter]]
Elon Musk himself has faced significant [[criticism_of_elon_musks_management_of_twitter | criticism]] regarding his personal use of the platform and the content he promotes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. He has been accused of blindly echoing Chinese, Russian, and Iranian propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. More recently, concerns have been raised about his engagement with white supremacist and anti-semitic narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. These actions have led some to conclude that Musk's public persona as a "green or a businessman" is misleading, suggesting he is "an unapologetic apartheid era white South African" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

Due to these issues, some users have decided to cease active engagement with Twitter, although the platform may still be used as a distribution channel for content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Despite the decline, some hold out hope for a future change in management or policy that might restore the platform to a more usable state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

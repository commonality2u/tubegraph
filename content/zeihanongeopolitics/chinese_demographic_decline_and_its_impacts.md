China is currently experiencing a "triple economic funk," marked by several significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Unlike most other countries, China has not fully recovered from COVID-19. While many nations saw a surge in consumption and inflation after reopening, China's growth is now lower than it was during supposed lockdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Consumption is down, and imports and exports both dropped by double-digit percentages in July compared to the previous year, a phenomenon typically seen in war-torn countries like Ukraine or Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This is occurring despite the Chinese government's efforts to return to normalcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## The Demographic Bomb

A significant factor contributing to China's economic woes is a "demographic bomb" that predates COVID-19, with negative demographic trends emerging as early as 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. From 2017 to 2021, the birth rate in China plummeted by approximately 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Even before the pandemic, new car sales, a key indicator of population confidence and future spending, began to decline and have not recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

Modern economies typically see the most consumption from individuals in their 20s and 30s, who are buying homes, cars, and raising children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. However, due to the one-child policy, which has been in effect for over 40 years, China lacks a substantial generation in this crucial demographic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. These long-standing demographic trends are now significantly manifesting in current economic data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This contributes to [[Chinas demographic challenges | China's demographic challenges]] and [[Chinas demographic challenges and economic growth | demographic challenges impacting economic growth]].

## Deflationary Pressures

Unlike other major economies that experienced post-COVID inflation, China is facing deflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. The anticipated consumption boom never occurred, meaning supply chains did not have to adjust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Instead, reduced consumer confidence has led to decreased consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Concurrently, increasing trade wars with Europe, Japan, the United States, and countries like Korea are limiting export markets for Chinese goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

This situation results in an oversupply of goods trapped within China, coupled with insufficient demand both domestically and internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This imbalance drives prices down, leading to deflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. While current data represents only one month, it aligns with expectations for the start of a deflationary spiral caused by a fundamental mismatch between supply and demand, exacerbated by deglobalization and [[Chinese demographics and population collapse | China's demographic trends]] that are "well past the point of no return" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

Japan faced a similar major deflationary period starting in the late 1990s, which lasted for 20 to 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Addressing such a mismatch between supply and demand is challenging. Solutions typically involve reducing supply (leading to job losses and further reduced spending) or increasing demand through government stimulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## Limitations of China's Economic Model

China's economic system is primarily driven by investment, where the state encourages extensive borrowing to build industrial infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This sector accounts for 40% to 70% of the Chinese economy and has been the main driver of growth for four decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. However, there's a limit to how long this model can be sustained; China had likely reached the point where it no longer needed more bridges or factories even before COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

Further government spending is unlikely to be effective. The marginal economic growth generated per Yuan spent has been steadily declining for 40 years, now yielding less than one-to-one returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This mirrors Japan's experience in the late 1990s and early 2000s, where their economic model became unsustainable, leading to negative returns on investments and two decades of deflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

Japan had advantages China lacks, including an established global supply chain, international allies, options for offshoring manufacturing, strong demand from the United States, and a robust political relationship with the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Crucially, Japan was already a wealthy nation when it entered its deflationary period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. In contrast, the average Chinese citizen's income today is only about a quarter to a fifth of what the average Japanese citizen's income was in 2000, adjusted for inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

This suggests China is aging and entering a permanent recession and deflationary spiral long before achieving significant wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. While the current data represents only one month, it reflects a delayed alignment of economic indicators with underlying [[Demographic Challenges Facing China | demographic]] and geopolitical trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. If these trends continue, the situation could rapidly worsen due to years of compressed damage now becoming apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The centralized political system in China, largely reliant on one individual, may also limit the state's capacity for creative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Japan, even with public discussion and alliances, took a generation to recover from its deflationary period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

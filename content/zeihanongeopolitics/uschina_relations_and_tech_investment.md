New [[investment_restrictions_on_chinese_tech | investment restrictions on Chinese tech]] have been implemented by the Biden Administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. These measures involve bars on private equity and venture capital firms to constrain capital flows to the [[impact_of_tech_sanctions_on_chinese_market | Chinese tech space]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The focus is on technologies with potential military applications or those involved in artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The administration has indicated that these are the initial steps in a series of restrictions that will become "steadily deeper and wider" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## China's Capital Environment

China's primary issue is not a lack of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The Chinese government [[chinese_capital_management_and_state_investment | limits investment options]], preventing capital from flowing abroad or even significantly into its own stock markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This strategy aims to "supersaturate" the capital environment for Chinese firms, particularly state-owned enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This "captured capital" is then used to fund industries deemed strategically important, maintain full employment, and has driven explosive growth over the last three decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

However, the returns on capital in China are among the lowest globally, with some recent data suggesting negative returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Despite this, China possesses the domestic financial capacity to invest heavily in areas like AI without external assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

The Chinese money supply is approximately double that of the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. While the U.S. money supply has been shrinking for the past year, China's has not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The majority of China's currency is traded domestically or in Hong Kong, limiting its international exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Impact of US Policy Shift

The true value of American venture capital and private equity for China lies in the access it provides to American firms and, ultimately, the American market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. China is not a leader in cutting-edge technical development and lacks the workforce to translate new ideas into manufacturing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. They require American know-how and connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

The Biden Administration's policy aims to prevent China from leveraging American capital, expertise, and networks to displace American industries in the global market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This shift is part of an increasingly stringent series of [[impact_of_us_policy_shift_on_china | restrictions by the U.S. on all things Chinese]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

Despite over a trillion dollars in subsidies, China has struggled to develop mid-to-high-end semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. With the new restrictions, it's uncertain if China can even maintain its current technological position, as many doors previously used to operationalize technologies are now closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

These are just the beginning of the Biden administration's [[impact_of_tech_sanctions_on_chinese_market | tech sanctions on the Chinese]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The U.S. consumer market is over three times the size of China's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Without access to this market, China faces challenges in maintaining its employment and tax systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

On the international front, key partners are aligning with U.S. policy. Japan, the Netherlands, and the UK are already onboard with the [[global_alignments_in_tech_restrictions_against_china | tech sanctions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Taiwan and South Korea are in the process of finalizing their participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This broad alignment significantly limits China's access to critical global technology and markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

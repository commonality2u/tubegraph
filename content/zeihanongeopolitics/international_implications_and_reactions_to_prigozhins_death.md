The death of Yevgeny Prigozhin, leader of the Wagner Group, aboard a plane crash in Russia, was not a low probability outcome considering his life choices and associations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. While many internal Russian figures may have wished him dead, a number of international actors also had motives or were impacted by his activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[02:57]</a>.

## International Suspects and Reactions

### Ukraine
[[economic_implications_for_russia_due_to_ukrainian_attacks | Ukraine]] had reasons to want Prigozhin dead, as he was responsible for killing many Ukrainians during the "meat grinder assault" on Bakhmut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[03:02]</a>.

### Poland
[[strategic_and_diplomatic_implications_for_russia | Poland]] was "a little nervous" about Prigozhin, as he and the Wagner Group were supposed to relocate to Belarus following the coup deal, and they subsequently settled near the Polish border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[03:06]</a>.

### Belarus
Belarusian President Lukashenko, described as a "schemer of the former Soviet world," was the one who allegedly brokered the deal between [[vladimir_putins_involvement_and_potential_motive | Putin]] and Prigozhin after the coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. In the "former Soviet world," deals often do not hold until someone is dead, suggesting this outcome could have been part of the arrangement from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

### United States
The United States also had reasons to want Prigozhin dead. He founded the "Troll Factory" and openly bragged about interfering in the American presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[03:46]</a>.

## Broader International Implications
[[the_death_of_wagner_group_leader_yevgeny_prigozhin | Prigozhin's death]] is significant because he held a crucial role for the [[russian_influence_on_global_political_dynamics_and_us_response | Russian State]], providing plausible deniability for various operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[04:50]</a>. He was involved in the "little green men fiascos" during the original 2014 Crimea War, interfered in US elections, and led operations in a dozen African countries where he was accused of war crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[05:00]</a>. This role is too important for the Kremlin to leave empty; someone new will likely step forward to fill the void <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[05:14]</a>.

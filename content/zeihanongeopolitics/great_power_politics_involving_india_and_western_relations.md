Recent events, specifically the alleged assassination of a Sikh emigrant on Canadian soil, have shed light on the evolving dynamics of [[Indias international relations and foreign policy | India's international relations and foreign policy]] and its engagement with Western nations. The incident involved Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accusing the Indian government of orchestrating the assassination of a Canadian citizen who had renounced his Indian citizenship but supported separatist groups in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Intelligence Confirmation and New Indian Capabilities

Intelligence supporting Canada's accusation did not originate from Canada but from the United States, and was shared through the Five Eyes systemâ€”a intelligence-sharing alliance between Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The intelligence was further verified by the British government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. All Five Eyes members quietly affirmed Canada's stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

This alleged action marks a "fundamentally new capacity" for India, as it is the first time the Indian government has been observed assassinating someone outside its immediate borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. While assassinations are becoming more prevalent among state actors like Russia and the United States, India's entry into this practice is significant due to its arguably largest diaspora globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The use of extra-territorial and extra-legal means could lead to serious [[global_implications_of_indian_governments_actions_abroad | global implications]] if an individual significant to a foreign government becomes a target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Diplomatic Fallout and Diaspora Response

[[India and Canadas diplomatic tensions over assassination | Diplomatic tensions]] between India and Canada are exacerbated by Canada being a major destination for Indian students and home to India's fastest-growing ethnic group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Far from quelling discussion, the assassination is likely to generate more agitation within Canada's free press environment, amplifying publicity even within India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Western Alliances and Strategic Prioritization

The confirmation of India's alleged actions by the Five Eyes nations directly impacts relations between India and its Western partners, including Australia, the UK, and the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The US and Australia are part of the Quad grouping with India, a security-focused dialogue, while the UK maintains significant economic and Commonwealth ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

Despite these concerns, the primary focus for the United States and Australia remains [[comparison_of_india_and_china | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. In the realm of great power politics, niceties often fall by the wayside in favor of hard security concerns when facing a perceived large threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This means partnering with diverse countries, even those with "unsavory" aspects, to counter a greater adversary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Historical examples include the US partnering with Stalin against Hitler and Mao against Stalin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

## India's Independent Path

This strategic reality suggests that the US, and to a lesser extent, British and Australian relations with India, will likely remain focused on countering China, despite India's actions. The relationship is seen as an alliance against a specific threat rather than a deep friendship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

India faces significant decisions as actions against China intensify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. While a more productive relationship with Western nations is possible, India has historically prioritized its own interests, even during the Cold War when it unofficially sided with the Soviets while maintaining a stance of non-alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

Regardless of its relationship with the West, India is positioned to do very well, especially given the speaker's prediction that China's current state is not sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. India's policy decisions will ultimately be made in New Delhi, prioritizing Indian interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

Modern warfare has been fundamentally reshaped by the integration and democratization of information technologies, leading to what is described as a two-phase [[revolution_in_military_affairs | Revolution in Military Affairs]] (RMA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Phase One: Information Technology and Precision Warfare (1990s-2000s)

The first phase of the [[revolution_in_military_affairs | Revolution in Military Affairs]] began in the 1990s and 2000s, primarily driven by the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This phase involved marrying information technologies with military capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Key aspects included:

*   **Integration of Sensors and Targeting Information:** Information, whether from satellites or attached directly to weapons, allowed for precise targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Precision Guided Munitions:** Technologies like Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) and Tomahawk cruise missiles exemplify this era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Accuracy:** Explosive ordnance could be delivered to a target with a very high degree of accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This eliminated the need for tactics like carpet bombing, allowing specific targets to be hit with one or two weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **Limitations:** Early ideas that precision weapons combined with hypersonics would eliminate all rules of warfare proved incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Challenges like jamming and the impracticality of using expensive precision weapons against massed infantry (e.g., 100,000 soldiers instead of a single tank) highlighted their limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Hypersonics, while having a role, were too expensive to be a determining factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

The first phase transformed the US's "lumbering Cold War defense industry" into a force with extreme range and precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

## Phase Two: Democratization of Technology

The current second phase of the [[revolution_in_military_affairs | Revolution in Military Affairs]] focuses on the democratization of these technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Instead of centralized control from the White House or a general's chair, individual soldiers are now gaining command of information and can make targeting decisions autonomously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

This phase is most aggressively observed in [[ukraine_war_and_military_innovation | Ukraine]], primarily through the widespread use of [[drones_and_autonomous_warfare | drones]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The Ukrainians are employing a four-part strategy involving these technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>:

### Ukrainian Drone Strategy

1.  **Naval Warfare:**
    *   Ukrainian forces are applying [[drones_and_autonomous_warfare | drone]] technologies to "jet skis" loaded with hundreds of pounds of explosives to target Russian naval vessels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
    *   This has been highly effective, making the western half of the Black Sea a no-go zone for the Russian Fleet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
    *   Larger Russian ships often cannot shoot back because their deck-mounted weapons are designed to hit targets at the horizon or higher, not small boats in the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

2.  **Anti-Personnel / Swarm Tactics:**
    *   Due to challenges in receiving conventional aid like artillery shells from the American Congress, Ukrainians have mass-produced very small [[drones_and_autonomous_warfare | drones]] with a payload of about one pound (grenade-sized) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
    *   These are used to counter Russian human wave tactics, sending swarms of them to drop grenades on massed infantry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
    *   In the Battle of Avdiivka, Ukrainians inflicted 8:1 to 10:1 casualty ratios on the Russians despite lacking artillery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This marks a significant [[changes_in_battlefield_strategies_and_dynamics | change in battlefield strategies and dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

3.  **Mid-Range Infrastructure Strikes:**
    *   Ukrainians have developed [[drones_and_autonomous_warfare | drones]] called the Scythe and the Beaver for mid-range infrastructure strikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
    *   The Beaver is more technologically advanced with longer range and better avionics, while the Scythe is simpler, described as a "garage project" largely made of plywood, with less range but still carrying a decent warhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
    *   These [[drones_and_autonomous_warfare | drones]] target infrastructure within a few hundred kilometers of the front line, including Russian refineries and fuel depots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

4.  **Deep Strikes / [[economic_and_strategic_warfare_using_drones | Economic and Strategic Warfare]] (Phoenix Ghost):**
    *   The American-supplied Phoenix Ghost [[drones_and_autonomous_warfare | drone]] carries a small warhead (5 to 15 lbs) but is modular, lightweight, and can be carried by a single soldier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
    *   Initially used against armored vehicles and supply trucks, Ukrainians quickly adapted them for high-accuracy deep strikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
    *   Unlike many [[drones_and_autonomous_warfare | drones]], the Phoenix Ghost provides a live visual feed to the controller, allowing for strikes within a couple of feet of the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
    *   This enables Ukrainian Special Forces to operate deep within Russia, assembling the [[drones_and_autonomous_warfare | drones]] and targeting unprotected refinery components like distillation towers, leading to significant damage and fires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
    *   These strikes regularly take offline 500,000 to 1 million barrels per day of Russian refining capacity, impacting approximately 8% of Russian government revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Destroying refining capacity can create [[significance_of_logistics_and_infrastructure_in_warfare | logistical]] issues for Russia's crude oil production, potentially forcing them to shut in wells due to pipeline saturation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

### Implications and Future Outlook

This second phase of the [[revolution_in_military_affairs | Revolution in Military Affairs]] demonstrates a new form of warfare, combining [[economic_and_strategic_warfare_using_drones | strategic warfare]], [[role_of_drones_in_modern_warfare | naval warfare]], infantry warfare, and [[economic_and_strategic_warfare_using_drones | economic warfare]] that was not previously considered possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Many of these [[drones_and_autonomous_warfare | drones]] are 100% Ukrainian-born <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

This development is comparable to the technological leaps seen during the American Civil War and the Crimean Campaign, where observers studied early industrial warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Countries are now sending observers to [[ukraine_war_and_military_innovation | Ukraine]] to study this "fundamentally new technological breakthrough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

The current trend maintains the precision achieved in the first phase while marrying it to individual decision-making, utilizing tens of thousands of decentralized weapons platforms that can be launched quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The ability for individuals to target enemy formations at scale across a thousand-mile front, and hundreds of miles behind the front, is unprecedented in warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, and its full transformative impact is only beginning to be understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

The possibility of a severe oil crash due to conflict in the [[geopolitical_tensions_in_the_middle_east | Middle East]] has emerged as a significant concern, a scenario previously deemed unlikely due to Iran's reliance on oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This shift in assessment follows recent [[geopolitical_tensions_in_the_middle_east | geopolitical tensions]] and the potential for retaliatory actions.

## The "Next Gulf War" Scenario

This conflict is envisioned as one of the "Wars of Deglobalization," where countries act desperately or seize opportunities as the [[us_involvement_in_the_middle_east_and_challenges_in_global_security | US steps back]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The scenario involves Iran and [[potential_security_allies_for_saudi_arabia | Saudi Arabia]] fighting each other, driven by an inability to reliably export energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. In this situation, 10 to 12 million barrels of crude oil could be at risk globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Iranian Oil Sector Vulnerabilities

Following Iran's missile launch against Israel, the Israelis have indicated their intent to retaliate, specifically shortlisting Iran's oil sector as a potential target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### Kharg Island: Iran's Achilles' Heel

Kharg Island is identified as a highly vulnerable and obvious target for an attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure:** Subsea pipelines connect the mainland to the island, and all of Iran's offshore loading platforms are located near it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Significance:** It is the only meaningful export point for Iranian crude oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Israeli Capability:** Israel has demonstrated its ability to neutralize air defense systems, as seen in the targeting of air defenses around Iran's nuclear program in Isfahan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Impact:** An Israeli strike could devastate Iran's entire oil export capacity with just a few sorties, completed within an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Potential Iranian Retaliation and Counter-Targets

Should Iran's oil export capacity be crippled, it would leave them with little to lose and could trigger a desperate push to target [[potential_security_allies_for_saudi_arabia | Saudi Arabia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Military Invasion Scenario

One outlined scenario involves a military invasion crossing into Iraq and Kuwait to target oil fields in the south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This is based on the southern half of Iraq being predominantly Shia-populated and having a historically pro-Iranian stance since the war against Saddam Hussein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The ease of such an invasion would depend on the involvement of other countries, including the [[us_involvement_in_the_middle_east_and_challenges_in_global_security | United States]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### Missile Strikes on Gulf States

Even without a ground invasion, Iran possesses enough missiles to target oil export and processing facilities on the western side of the Persian Gulf, specifically in [[potential_security_allies_for_saudi_arabia | Saudi Arabia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Saudi Arabia's Vulnerability:** Most of [[potential_security_allies_for_saudi_arabia | Saudi Arabia]]'s crude comes from the Ghawar region, located near the coast, and most loading platforms are on the Gulf Coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Regional Impact:** A conflict affecting both Iran and [[potential_security_allies_for_saudi_arabia | Saudi Arabia]] could reduce globally available oil by 10 million barrels or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. If Iraq, UAE, or Kuwait are also impacted, the figure could rise to 20 million barrels per day, potentially driving oil prices above $300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## Varying Impacts of a Conflict

Not all global players would be affected equally by such a conflict:

### United States

The US could potentially insulate itself from the most severe price shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Export Authority:** Since 2015, the US President has the authority to summarily end all American crude oil exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Market Impact:** Ending exports would create a super-saturated market within the US, potentially capping domestic prices at $60-$70 a barrel, while global prices could skyrocket to $200-$300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **California Exception:** California would be an exception, as it lacks pipeline connections to other US oil fields and imports most of its crude from the Persian Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This could lead to gasoline prices of $10 a gallon on the West Coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

### China

China would suffer significantly as the largest consumer of crude from [[potential_security_allies_for_saudi_arabia | Saudi Arabia]], UAE, Kuwait, and Iran â€“ all sources that would be severely disrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### Persian Gulf Producers

Producers in the Persian Gulf would experience uneven impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Bypass Pipelines:** [[potential_security_allies_for_saudi_arabia | Saudi Arabia]] and the Emirates have constructed bypass pipelines to avoid the Strait of Hormuz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   **Resilience:** These pipelines could still export 5 to 6.5 million barrels a day, mitigating the budgetary sting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. If oil prices tripled while exports were halved, [[potential_security_allies_for_saudi_arabia | Saudi Arabia]] could be in a stronger financial position, provided it's not conquered by Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

The likelihood of this disruptive scenario occurring within the next few months is estimated to be between one in four and one in three, depending on Israeli actions and Iran's subsequent response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

Peter Zeihan has announced his complete departure from Twitter as a primary information and engagement platform, citing three main reasons for the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. While the platform will still be used as a distribution channel for videos, direct engagement will cease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

## Deterioration of Information Quality

Initially, Twitter was valued for providing access to firsthand information from areas inaccessible to mainstream media, such as during the Ukraine War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. The increasing role of technology in global media has led to fewer human resources vetting stories, resulting in more opinion and less fact-checking in news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. Twitter offered a crucial source of information directly from individuals on the front lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

Prior to Elon Musk's acquisition, the old Twitter management purged Russian bots, which significantly reduced the spread of disinformation and enhanced the platform's utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. However, after Musk took over, he eliminated content moderation in the name of free speech, leading to a resurgence of bots and misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. This change has resulted in Zeihan's curated feed becoming 90-95% misinformation, transforming Twitter from a source of insight into a "time suck" filled with "crap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. This illustrates the [[impact_of_misinformation_on_social_media | impact of misinformation on social media]] and the [[challenges_facing_credible_news_consumption | challenges facing credible news consumption]] in the digital age.

## Loss of Engagement and Interactivity

Old Twitter was highly valued for its [[interactivity and user engagement on Twitter | interactivity and user engagement on Twitter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. It allowed direct engagement with information providers, enabling free information gathering and conversations with potential sources and viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. This interaction was a source of ideas for content, such as videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

Under the new management, the "For You" category, which fostered user engagement, has largely disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. Over a six-week period, Zeihan reported only seven interactions with his followers, while spam, including pornbots and crypto schemes, continues to bypass filters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. This shift has made Twitter one of the least rewarding parts of his job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

## Elon Musk's Personal Conduct

The final reason for leaving Twitter is attributed to [[criticism_of_elon_musks_management_of_twitter | Elon Musk's management of Twitter]] and his personal conduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. Concerns arose when Musk began blindly parroting Chinese, Russian, and Iranian propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. More recently, his actions have veered into white supremacist and antisemitic rhetoric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>, leading to the perception that he is an "unapologetic apartheid era white South African" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

Despite these issues, Twitter will still be used as a distribution channel for videos, particularly for users like "Crypt Bros" who may still find it useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. However, for reliable access to content, signing up for the newsletter at zeihan.com/newsletter is recommended, as videos are released there first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. Zeihan will continue to check Twitter periodically in hopes of future improvements in management or policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

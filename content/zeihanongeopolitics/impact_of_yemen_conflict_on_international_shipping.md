Yemen has been embroiled in an insurgency for decades, involving a relatively secular government, a Sunni militia (semi-officially affiliated with Al-Qaeda), and a Shiite group known as the [[houthi_insurgency_in_yemen | Houthis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Historically, the conflict has been considered by some as irrelevant and tedious due to the lack of significant resources like natural gas (most companies exited by 15-20 years ago) and the widespread use of Khat, a mild narcotic, by the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. However, the conflict's impact on global shipping routes has recently elevated its importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Houthi Attacks on Red Sea Shipping

Since the Gaza War began, the [[houthi_insurgency_in_yemen | Houthis]] have escalated their activities, launching missiles and drones at international shipping passing through the Red Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Their strategic position on the eastern side of the Bab el-Mandeb strait, at the southwestern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, allows them to reach vessels in this critical maritime choke point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The [[houthi_insurgency_in_yemen | Houthis]] claim these attacks target vessels affiliated with Israel, but in practice, they shoot at "anything that happens to go by" due to a lack of precise identification capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

### Iranian Support

The [[houthi_insurgency_in_yemen | Houthis]] are incapable of manufacturing their own weapons, so all their armaments are supplied by Iran, which specifically backs them in the multi-sided conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Iran's motivation for supporting the [[houthi_insurgency_in_yemen | Houthis]] stems from their desire to needle Saudi Arabia, their primary regional rival, by operating on Saudi Arabia's far side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Occasionally, Iran uses Houthi cover to launch missiles and drones into Saudi targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Saudi Arabia, for its part, has largely used Yemen as target practice, recognizing they lack the military capacity to fully root out these groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. A 2022 ceasefire between Saudi Arabia and the [[houthi_insurgency_in_yemen | Houthis]] allowed the latter (with Iranian assistance) to stockpile weapons in anticipation of future hostilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## US Response to Shipping Disruptions

The attacks on shipping by the [[houthi_insurgency_in_yemen | Houthis]] have disrupted approximately 12% of global trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The United States launched a moderate-sized air assault on Houthi targets on January 12th, local time, primarily targeting command and control systems, radar, and ammo dumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This strike was a direct response to a ballistic anti-ship missile being launched at a US Naval asset earlier that day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. The US message appears to be that while shipping disruption is a concern, targeting a US Navy vessel will invariably result in retaliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Iranian Calculus

Iran's relationship with the [[houthi_insurgency_in_yemen | Houthis]] is stronger than with groups like Hamas, as the [[houthi_insurgency_in_yemen | Houthis]] are Shia, fostering a sense of camaraderie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Unlike Hamas, which Iran views as disposable, the [[houthi_insurgency_in_yemen | Houthis]] are a more valuable asset in Iran's long-term strategy, particularly against Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Iran's primary strategic goal is to keep the [[houthi_insurgency_in_yemen | Houthis]] focused on Saudi Arabia, as this is where Iran's future conflict lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. They also want the United States to stay out of this regional rivalry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Therefore, while needling the US and Israel provides good PR, Iran is unlikely to "bleed for it" as their real fight requires preserving every asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

A similar incident in 2016 saw [[houthi_insurgency_in_yemen | Houthis]] targeting an American naval asset, leading to significant destruction of their capabilities and a subsequent cessation of such threats against US naval assets until recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This history suggests a potential for the situation to "smooth out" if Iran is willing to engage in conversation with the US administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. It is expected that tensions in Yemen might simmer down, allowing the focus to return to other geopolitical issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

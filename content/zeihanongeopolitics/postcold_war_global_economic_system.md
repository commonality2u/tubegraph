The [[global_economic_system_transformation | global economic system]] that developed after World War II and continued into the post-Cold War era was largely shaped and maintained by the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This system was not created primarily for the benefit of the United States itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, as the US has a continental economic system and its experience with international trade has been primarily local, even with neighbors like Mexico and Canada since 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Origins and Purpose

At the end of World War II, the United States faced the Soviet Union and perceived a significant threat, being outnumbered and geographically disadvantaged in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. To prevent a Soviet takeover of Western Europe, the US needed to induce other nations to stand up to the Soviets and physically position themselves between American forces and the Soviet threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

The solution was the establishment of a [[global_economic_system_transformation | new global network]] centered on global trade and globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This system provided an "incredible inducement" for countries to align with the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Mechanism of the System

The core components of this [[global_economic_system_transformation | global economic system]] were:
*   **US Navy Patrols:** The US Navy was deployed to patrol the global oceans, ensuring that anyone could trade with anyone, at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Even today, the US Navy remains at least seven times more powerful than all other navies combined, excluding close allies like the British and Japanese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Open US Market:** The American market, which was the only major economy to survive World War II intact, was opened for exports from other nations to the US consumer market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. At the time, the US consumer market was comparable in size to the rest of the world combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Scale and Beneficiaries

This system created the [[global_economic_restructuring_and_its_impacts | world of today]], with a global GDP of roughly $90 to $100 trillion, of which one-quarter to one-third is based on international exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. None of this would have been possible without the US patrolling the oceans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

The two countries that benefited most from this setup were:
*   **Germany:** Currently facing national economic oblivion within a decade due to demographic reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **China:** Aspirationally the next global superpower, despite lacking a global Navy, a consumption-led economic system, and many allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## [[Shift in US Global Strategic Role | Shift in US Global Strategic Role]] and [[Impact of US Withdrawal on Global Trade | Impact of US Withdrawal on Global Trade]]

For over a decade, the United States has been gradually withdrawing from maintaining this global system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This has led to incremental shifts in foreign policy, making the US less likely to protect international shipments, such as oil tankers or goods from the Russian space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. As allies face demographic challenges, the economic case for globalization weakens, and the security case has largely disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

> [!INFO] Example: Persian Gulf
> The Persian Gulf, a crucial maritime shipping area, exemplifies this shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. While the US traditionally sourced most of its energy from the Western Hemisphere and is now net independent, crude oil from the Persian Gulf primarily went to US allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. More recently, especially since the Russia-Ukraine War, most of this crude has gone to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
>
> The strategic justification for maintaining open sea lanes has weakened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This is reflected in policy changes:
> *   In recent months, the US Navy has not intervened when Iranian forces have confiscated or hijacked oil tankers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
> *   While the US is now deploying Marine Expeditionary Units (MEUs) to the Gulf (a carrier with 2,000 Marines), an MEU has about one-sixth the firepower of a Nimitz-class supercarrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. For years, the US had a supercarrier presence in the Gulf, sometimes two, but has recently gone years without a meaningful presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This represents a significant reduction in force compared to previous deployments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## Potential Disruptions to the System

The withdrawal of US protection makes the [[future_prospects_for_global_economic_systems | global economic system]] vulnerable to disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. A likely scenario involves Russia's increasing aggression, particularly targeting Ukraine's agricultural system and shipping confiscated grain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

It is anticipated that the United States may explicitly or implicitly remove protection for Russian maritime shipments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Should something happen to one of these ships, such as piracy or state seizure, global insurance rates will dramatically increase once the US Navy is no longer seen as providing global security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Impact on Supply Chains
> A slight disruption can break many supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Most manufacturing, especially for products below the level of cell phones and computers, operates on margins of less than three percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. These manufacturing processes often involve a dozen or more countries spanning the Asian rim and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
>
> If any one step in these low-margin product chains is interrupted, the entire chain can collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This is particularly true with containerized shipping, where thousands of containers hold hundreds of thousands of components for a single product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Such disruptions could lead to the entire economic model of East Asia breaking down rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

Businesses with complex, "gangly" supply chains may need to prepare for significant challenges, potentially even closure, as there may not be sufficient time to restructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

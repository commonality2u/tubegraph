Iran's stance on the ongoing [[israel_and_hamas_conflict_overview | Israel-Hamas conflict]] is characterized by rhetorical support for "resistance" while largely avoiding direct military engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:06">[03:01:06]</a>.

## Rhetoric and Support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:43">[02:52:43]</a>
Iran's Supreme Leader has delivered speeches expressing strong opposition to Israel, using phrases such as "fight the occupation, kill the Jews" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:43">[02:52:43]</a>. However, this aggressive rhetoric is paired with an stated intention to avoid direct confrontation with Israel "today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:06">[03:01:06]</a>.

## Actions and Limited Involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:06">[03:07:06]</a>
While vocally supportive, Iran has indicated that it will engage in "low-risk things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:06">[03:07:06]</a>. This includes using proxies to launch "poot shots" at American bases in areas like Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:39">[03:11:39]</a>.

As of recent reports, these proxy attacks have not resulted in "noticeable meaningful casualties or damage," limiting the [[usisrael_relations | United States']] need for a significant military response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:14">[03:22:14]</a>. Iran is unwilling to risk a broader confrontation with the American Navy in the Gulf, which is considered their primary source of influence and deterrence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:06">[03:32:06]</a>.

## Relationship with Hamas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:40">[03:41:40]</a>
Despite potential coordination on the timing of the [[hamas_attacks_on_israel | Hamas attacks on Israel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:43">[03:52:43]</a>, Iran has publicly denounced Hamas, referring to them as "apostates and animals" worthy of "destruction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:09">[03:44:09]</a>. This indicates that Iran is "certainly not going to bleed" for Hamas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:40">[03:55:40]</a>.

## Relationship with Hezbollah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:27">[02:39:27]</a>
Iran is described as a "sponsor ally" of [[hezbollahs_position_on_the_israel_hamas_conflict | Hezbollah]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:27">[02:39:27]</a>, a Shiite Arab militia operating primarily out of Southern Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:08">[02:27:08]</a>. Despite the alliance, [[hezbollahs_position_on_the_israel_hamas_conflict | Hezbollah]] is not expected to significantly engage in the current conflict, partly because the [[hamas_attacks_on_israel | Hamas]] operation was not coordinated with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:18">[02:07:18]</a>. [[hezbollahs_position_on_the_israel_hamas_conflict | Hezbollah]] also has different backers, religious affiliations, and strategic approaches, and does not wish to jeopardize its recent gains in Lebanese politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:07">[02:15:07]</a>.

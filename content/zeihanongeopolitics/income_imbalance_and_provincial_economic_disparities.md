Canada has historically faced challenges with income imbalance and economic disparities among its provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:50">[01:53:50]</a>.

## Historical Context

Around 15 to 20 years ago, Alberta was effectively the sole province financially supporting the rest of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:59">[01:56:59]</a>. Other provinces were experiencing significant aging populations nearing mass retirement, with Quebec being the furthest along and Ontario not far behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:60">[02:03:60]</a>.

The traditional arrangement that enabled Canada's existence relied on Ontario taxpayers funding Quebec to prevent its secession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:70">[02:11:70]</a>. This compact became unsustainable as Ontarians began to reach mass retirement, shifting the financial burden almost entirely onto Albertans, who were displeased with this situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:90">[02:20:90]</a>.

## Impact of Immigration

Unlike other countries that faced a "German or an Italian or Korean style" [[demographic_shifts_and_economic_implications | demographic decline and collapse]] 20 years ago, Canada chose immigration as a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:89">[00:26:89]</a>.

A significant immigration surge brought in approximately 4 million migrants, representing over 10% of Canada's population, with most being under age 35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. These new immigrants, having already completed primary and secondary education, are ready to enter the workforce, spend, and pay taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. This contrasts with previous immigration patterns where older migrants often became financial liabilities through pensions before contributing significantly in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

This influx of younger immigrants has led to a demographic shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. As a result, there are now more people in British Columbia, Ontario, and to a lesser extent, Quebec, who contribute to the national compact, providing the Canadian state with increased financial flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:50">[02:27:50]</a>. This strategy has helped Canada manage its internal economic imbalances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:10">[03:57:10]</a>.

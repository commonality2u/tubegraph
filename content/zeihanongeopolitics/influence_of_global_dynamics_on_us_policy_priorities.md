The landscape of American foreign and strategic policy has undergone significant [[shifts_in_us_foreign_policy_and_its_implications | shifts]] since approximately 2012, moving away from a long-standing bipartisan consensus. This internal political flux, coupled with evolving global dynamics, creates an uncertain future for US policy priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:17">[02:17:17]</a>.

## Historical Context: The Bipartisan Consensus
Until roughly 2012, the United States operated under a "bipartisan consensus" regarding foreign and strategic policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. The core tenets of this consensus included:
*   Opposition to the Soviet Union and global communism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
*   Building a worldwide alliance network to secure US security and economic well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.
*   Pursuing a free-trade, globalized world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>, aiming for most countries to benefit from participation in American security agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

This approach led to alliances like NATO, and pacts with Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, and helped integrate the non-aligned world into an economic powerhouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. This broad strategy "broadly worked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

## Erosion of Consensus and Current Flux
The bipartisan consensus began to erode around 2012. This was influenced by:
*   Eight years of "visceral disinterest in governing" during the Obama administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.
*   The presidencies of Donald Trump and Joe Biden, described as two of the most "economically populist presidents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

Over a 16-year period, the bipartisan consensus "withered away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. The Republican Party, historically responsible for much of the policy, saw its National Security conservatives and business conservatives become less integrated into the party architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. Some Republican factions are now "strangely aligned" on certain issues with [[russian_influence_on_global_political_dynamics_and_US_response | Russia]], [[impact_of_us_policy_shift_on_china | China]], Iran, and North Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. This indicates that security policy in the United States is no longer a settled issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

The United States is currently in a period of flux, both internally and internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. This turmoil suggests that many "normal National Security and economic precepts" are unlikely to survive, as the political parties that formed them are themselves in contention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. The leadership of both the Democratic and Republican parties are perceived as leading institutions into a "nonfunctional era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. A meaningful conversation about foreign policy is not expected for a few more years, as the parties will need to reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

### Political Leadership and Its Implications
The current political landscape presents challenges for consistent foreign policy:
*   **Kamala Harris (Democrat):** Described as having "very limited experience" and coming into the White House without a competent circle of loyal advisors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. Her only prior job experience before Vice President was as a prosecutor, viewed as a "relatively myopic view of anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.
*   **Donald Trump (Republican):** His mental fortitude for the job is questioned due to observed "degradation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. It is suggested that a vote for Trump might effectively be a vote for JD Vance, who is characterized as "even more of an empty suit than Kamala Harris" and a "chameleon" willing to say anything to gain power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.

Both potential candidates are seen as economically populist with limited real-world or government experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. This lack of experience means weak institutional loyalties and negligible policy experience, leading to little consistency from past foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.

## Presidential Prerogative and Congressional Influence
US foreign policy is largely a presidential prerogative, with Congress rarely having a say in its formative stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. This makes predicting future policy difficult without a clear understanding of the next president's institutional, political, or ethical leanings, as there is no track record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>.

The only policies likely to stick are those where the president has ceded authority to Congress and locked something in with an act of Congress, limiting presidential maneuverability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>. This is a very short list of items, mostly related to trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.

### NAFTA/USMCA: A Key Exception
The most important policy falling under this exception is the renegotiation of NAFTA (now USMCA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. Donald Trump's handling of this renegotiation is described as "brilliant," being "the right thing at the right time with the right partner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.
*   Mexico has become the US's number one trade partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.
*   Mexico is considered the "core" of any future economic relationship for the United States, especially to avoid a "dangerous and unequal relationship with China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.
*   The fact that the "isolationist right" conducted these negotiations is seen as beneficial, ensuring the agreement's stability regardless of the next president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.

This trade agreement is viewed as the "single most important foreign policy priority" for the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>. It is expected to remain stable because any successor, whether Harris or Vance, is unlikely to have the political authority or interest to overturn it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.

## Global Challenges Influencing Future Priorities
The future of US policy is also being shaped by significant global challenges:
*   Increasing belligerence and potential decline of [[impact_of_us_policy_shift_on_china | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.
*   The ongoing Ukraine war and the "[[russian_influence_on_global_political_dynamics_and_US_response | Russian demographic dissolution]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.
*   Fracturing of the European Alliance due to depopulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.

These [[impact_of_global_geopolitical_issues_on_us_foreign_policy_focus | global geopolitical issues]] highlight the importance of stable foundational policies like the trade relationship with Mexico for the US's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.

The ongoing conflict has led to significant strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia, primarily due to its increasing reliance on countries like North Korea and Iran for military support. This dependency highlights a weakening of Russia's own military-industrial complex and inadvertently draws new, capable players into the geopolitical landscape against Russia.

## Russia's Military Dependency and Vulnerabilities

Russia's military operations in Ukraine have become heavily reliant on external assistance, particularly from countries not considered technological leaders.
*   Reports indicate that North Korean troops are in the process of deploying to Russia, with technical advisors already assisting Russians on using North Korean weaponry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:53">[01:43:53]</a>.
*   North Korea is providing ballistic missiles and artillery shells, potentially accounting for as much as half of the artillery shells used by Russia in Ukraine this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. These shells are often of poor quality, sometimes causing more damage to Russian artillery tubes than to Ukrainian targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.
*   Iran is also involved, supplying Shahed drones, with over a thousand having been utilized in the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

This reliance on "fourth string countries" for essential military supplies "bodes really, really badly" for Russia's long-term ability to sustain the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. Russia is reportedly only able to produce a "double digits number" of new tanks annually, largely refurbishing older models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. This suggests that the technical capabilities within Russia's military-industrial complex have diminished to the point where they may become "wholly dependent upon imports of weapons" in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>, creating new vulnerabilities for the [[strategic_implications_of_russian_military_logistics_disruption | Russian war machine]] that can be exploited by adversaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>.

## Unintended Diplomatic and Strategic Consequences

Russia's actions have inadvertently brought new, significant players into the conflict, shifting the broader geopolitical balance.
*   The deployment of North Korean troops offers an "intelligence bonanza" for the United States and South Korea, providing an unprecedented opportunity to gain information on North Korean military performance and update war plans for the Korean Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
*   Iran's involvement with drones creates an opportunity for Israel. As Israel considers retaliation for recent missile attacks, it could, with U.S. blessing, target Iranian facilities that manufacture Shahed drones, thereby removing a "huge source of military capability" from Russia in the Ukraine war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

This increased involvement of North Korea and Iran has caused South Korea and Israel to become "involved" in the conflict, loosening their previous political restrictions on providing assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.
*   South Korea is one of the world's largest arms exporters, capable of producing high-quality artillery, rocket systems, and tanks at a significantly lower price point than Western counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.
*   Israel is a world leader in anti-missile, anti-artillery, and anti-rocket technologies, particularly with its Iron Dome system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.

The potential for cooperation between South Korea and Israel—combining Israel's technological acumen with South Korea's mass production capabilities—could "change the Strategic calculus" positively for both nations and for the "entire Western Alliance system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>. This unforeseen consequence of Russia's reliance on North Korea and Iran is considered "one of the dumbest things that the Russians could do," as it risks bringing powerful new adversaries into the conflict against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>.

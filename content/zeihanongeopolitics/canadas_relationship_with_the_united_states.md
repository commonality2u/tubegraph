Canada's relationship with the United States is undergoing a significant transformation in the context of a "post-American series," which envisions a world where the United States becomes less globally engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Historical Dynamic

Historically, Canada has benefited from its relatively small population, which posed no threat to the American mainland since the War of 1812 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This allowed Canada to "ring concession after concession" out of Washington simply because it was not considered particularly important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

During periods like the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Berlin Wall fiasco, or conflicts in Iraq, Canada could offer support to the US in exchange for trade concessions, such as those related to auto parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. This approach proved effective throughout the Cold War and into the post-Cold War era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This historical dynamic shaped [[canadas_economic_and_trade_relations_with_the_united_states | Canada's economic and trade relations with the United States]].

## Shifting Landscape

The dynamic began to change in the post-9/11 period, particularly with the Trump administration and beyond, as the United States started to equate trade issues with national security concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. In this new environment, Canada has "nowhere to run" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

As the United States withdraws from its role in maintaining global order, there are fewer international crises that garner its attention, such as the Berlin Airlift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Consequently, Canada's standing on the American "watch list" has shifted from around number 23 to approximately number three or four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This has resulted in Canadians losing their historical "wiggle room" in negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### A Harsher Relationship

The relationship between Canada and the United States is becoming "much harsher, more direct, more bare-knuckled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. A United States primarily focused on North America must now devote more attention to Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

Furthermore, Canada operates as a confederacy where individual provinces can set different trade policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This structure makes Canada, as a whole, one of the most protectionist countries the United States regularly engages with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. The US is now taking greater notice of this, and possesses "a lot more levers" in the bilateral relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This new dynamic showcases the [[impact_of_american_foreign_policy_on_canada | impact of American foreign policy on Canada]] and could lead to increased [[economic_coercion_and_uscanada_relations | economic coercion and US-Canada relations]].

While Finland has historically maintained a neutral stance, particularly due to concerns about facing Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, its recent decision to join [[nato_expansion_and_baltic_sea_control | NATO]] has shifted its diplomatic and security landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

Despite being targeted by recent [[russia_and_chinas_actions_against_finland | actions from Russia and China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, Finland is not considered alone in its strategic position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. The country maintains excellent relations with its "Scandinavian cousins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. These key allies include:

*   Denmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>
*   Sweden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>
*   Norway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>

These nations, collectively referred to as "the Vikings," form strong alliances with Finland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Finland's long-standing [[finlands_historical_military_preparedness | military preparedness]] and its strategic alliances are significant, especially given historical contexts such as the Winter War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

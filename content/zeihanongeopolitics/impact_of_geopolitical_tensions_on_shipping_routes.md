Global maritime shipping faces an increasingly unstable environment due to a confluence of geopolitical tensions and other disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. While a complete breakdown of the traditional system has not yet occurred, a fragile equilibrium has emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

## Current Disruptions and Tensions

Several factors are currently challenging the safety and efficiency of global shipping:

*   **Ukraine-Russia Conflict**: Ukraine has targeted Russian energy facilities in the Baltic Sea (Usluga) and Black Sea (Tuapse) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Roughly two-thirds of the Black Sea has become a "no-go zone" due to Russian actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This impacts [[impact_of_ukrainian_attacks_on_russian_commercial_shipping | Russian commercial shipping]] and creates [[implications_of_disrupted_oil_and_grain_exports_from_the_black_sea | disruptions to Black Sea exports]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Panama Canal Drought**: A severe drought in Panama has reduced the throughput of the Panama Canal by one-third to two-thirds, depending on the metric (value or tonnage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Houthi Attacks in Yemen**: Houthi forces in Yemen have targeted vessels in the Red Sea, reducing shipping through the region by approximately 10% for energy and cargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This contributes to the [[impact_of_yemen_conflict_on_international_shipping | impact of the Yemen conflict on international shipping]] and overall [[geopolitical_tensions_in_the_middle_east | geopolitical tensions in the Middle East]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Piracy**: Piracy has re-emerged in Somalia and persists in areas like the Gulf of Guinea and the Strait of Malacca <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Chinese Assertiveness**: China is making increasingly vocal demands to alter the security environment in its immediate vicinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

Despite these significant [[challenges_in_global_maritime_shipping | challenges in global maritime shipping]], a "meaningful break in the old system" has not yet occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## The Role of Insurance and the "Ghost Fleet"

A key factor in the current stability is the global insurance structure for vessels and cargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. While sanctions on Russia have denied insurance to Russian shipping, Indian, Chinese, and Russian state companies have stepped in to offer policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

This has led to the development of a "ghost fleet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>:
*   Comprised mostly of older vessels nearing decommissioning, brought back into service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   Primarily used for hauling liquids, but also includes bulkers and some container ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   Insured by Chinese, Indian, or Russian policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   May constitute up to 10% of the global tanker fleet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   Operates largely "under the table" from the perspective of global record-keeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

This ghost fleet has deferred and absorbed risk, acting as a buffer in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## Unstable Equilibrium and Future Breakdown

Currently, nations are largely avoiding direct targeting of each other's commercial shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. The US Navy continues to patrol oceans, benefiting global trade, particularly for China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. However, this equilibrium is considered "very unstable" and not sustainable in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

The breakdown of the system could be triggered by several events, leading to [[potential_geopolitical_shifts | geopolitical shifts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>:
*   A ghost fleet ship encountering trouble, raising questions about potential US Navy intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   A "real country" targeting another country's shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   US action against Iranian activities in the Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   Chinese actions in the South China Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   Ukraine accidentally hitting a third-party vessel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   Russia boarding or capturing a vessel en route to a Ukrainian port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## Consequences of Disruption

A breakdown in the current system would eliminate the existing buffer and insulation, leading to a rapid collapse of global shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This would render long-range shipping, especially through dangerous areas, no longer viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

The primary beneficiaries of the current global shipping system are:
*   Russian sanctions-busting oil exports, which require long hauls around Eurasia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   Chinese merchandise exports, also requiring extensive long-haul routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

These longest-haul operations, often traversing dangerous zones, would be the first and most significantly impacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Given that East Asia accounts for half of all manufacturing supply chain steps, global manufacturing, especially in computing and electronics, is reliant on safe global shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

A future without safe global shipping will necessitate a fundamental shift towards a new model, likely based on regional trade rather than global exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This potential shift highlights the broader [[impact_of_global_geopolitical_issues_on_us_foreign_policy_focus | impact of global geopolitical issues on US foreign policy focus]] and the global economy.

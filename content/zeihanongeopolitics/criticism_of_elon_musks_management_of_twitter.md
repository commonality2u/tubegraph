Criticism of Elon Musk's management of Twitter centers on significant changes to the platform's content moderation, user engagement, and the personal conduct of Musk himself. These changes have prompted individuals, including content creators like Peter Zeihan, to stop actively using the platform for research and interaction, leading to [[reasons_for_leaving_twitter | reasons for leaving Twitter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Decline in Information Quality and Content Moderation

Initially, Twitter was valued for providing access to firsthand information from places that mainstream media could not or would not reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. For example, during the Ukraine War, individuals with personal contacts could share information, which, despite requiring vetting, served as a crucial source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The previous Twitter management had purged Russian bots, which helped reduce spam and [[impact_of_misinformation_on_social_media | disinformation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

However, under Elon Musk's ownership, there has been a marked decline:
*   **Destruction of Content Moderation** As part of a commitment to free speech, Musk "destroyed all [[changes_in_twitters_content_moderation | content moderation]]" and "allowed [and] encouraged the Bots to come back in force" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Increase in Misinformation** This policy shift has led to a significant increase in [[impact_of_misinformation_on_social_media | misinformation]], with personal feeds reportedly consisting of 90-95% misinformation, making it difficult to discern what is happening in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Pornbot and Crypto Spam** While legitimate interactions are hindered, spam, including pornbots and crypto schemes (especially porn-themed ones), easily proliferates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Deterioration of Interactivity and User Engagement

Twitter's prior appeal also stemmed from its [[interactivity_and_user_engagement_on_twitter | interaction]] features, which allowed users to engage directly with information providers and sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This facilitated free information gathering and enabled creators to gauge audience interest for future content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

Under new management, this [[interactivity_and_user_engagement_on_twitter | interaction]] has largely ceased:
*   The "4u" category has disappeared from feeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   User engagement has dramatically dropped, with one user reporting only seven interactions over six weeks with all their followers combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   The platform has transformed from a rewarding part of one's job to a "time suck and a waste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Criticism of Elon Musk's Personal Conduct

Elon Musk's personal behavior and perceived biases have also drawn sharp criticism:
*   **Parroting Propaganda** He has been observed "blindly parrot[ing] whatever piece of Chinese propaganda came across his screen," and subsequently doing the same for Russian and Iranian propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Divisive Views** More recently, he has adopted "the white supremacist Road and the anti-semitic Road" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, leading some to conclude that he is "an unapologetic apartheid era white South African" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

Despite these criticisms, some content creators continue to use Twitter as a distribution channel for videos, though they emphasize more reliable alternatives like newsletters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

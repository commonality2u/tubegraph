The [[US military strategy and current status | United States' military strategy]] regarding the [[Impact of the Russia Ukraine Conflict on Naval Strategy | Ukraine war]] is shaped by the imperative to avoid direct involvement due to the significant risk of nuclear escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Consequently, the US is primarily engaged in supplying the [[ukrainian_military_strategy_and_offensive_preparations | Ukrainians]] to fight the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Equipment and Support

Much of the [[us_military_support_and_equipment_transfer_to_ukraine | military assets being transferred]] to Ukraine are older, decommissioned equipment from the 1970s and 1980s that the US no longer considers part of its active inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The US views these transfers as a disposal of old equipment, with the [[ukrainian_military_strategy_and_offensive_ तैयारी | Ukrainians]] effectively saving the US money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This approach ensures that the US Army retains its primary equipment, with minimal impact on its overall readiness, aside from some ammunition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Artillery shell production has also significantly increased, now producing five times the pre-war daily amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Broader Strategic Context

Historically, during the Cold War, the [[US military strategy and current status | US military policy]] aimed to be capable of fighting "two and a half wars" simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. In the post-Cold War era, this shrunk to focusing on one major conflict due to more concentrated and focused assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

Despite concerns about simultaneous conflicts with [[russian_military_strategies_and_advancements_in_ukraine | Russia]] and China, the US is deemed capable of managing both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. A potential conflict with China is expected to be primarily naval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The US can manage a land war in Eurasia (like supporting Ukraine) and a naval war in the Pacific simultaneously because these involve radically different military assets, command structures, and logistical chains that do not necessarily need to be in the same location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

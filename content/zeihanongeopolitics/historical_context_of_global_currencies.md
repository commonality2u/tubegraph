The notion that the [[global_dominance_of_the_us_dollar | US dollar]] is nearing its end as the global currency is a recurring idea, often asserted by those who may lack an understanding of historical context and economic realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Historically, a country's power as a global hegemon is a prerequisite for its currency to become the global standard, rather than the other way around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## The Role of Power in Global Currency Dominance

A global currency requires a power capable of imposing a "tax" on the trading system, ensuring the very possibility of trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This often translates to military and naval dominance, which secures trade routes and global stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. For example, the U.S. Navy is significantly more powerful than all other navies combined, with its expeditionary capabilities further amplified by allies like Japan and Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This strategic advantage underpins the [[global_dominance_of_the_us_dollar | US dollar]]'s position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Economic Requirements for a Global Currency

Beyond strategic power, a global currency must meet specific economic criteria to facilitate global trade:

*   **Immense Scale**: The currency must be vast enough to lubricate global exchange mechanisms, which involve tens of trillions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The actual currency supply must be even larger than the value of trade it supports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Insensitivity to Daily Fluctuations**: The issuing country cannot be overly concerned with the daily value changes of its currency, as trade surges can cause significant supply and demand shifts leading to domestic economic distortions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Persistent Trade Deficit**: The issuing country must be able to run a persistent trade deficit to provide its currency to traders worldwide, without needing to approve each transaction individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This criterion eliminates many potential contenders:
    *   European currencies are disqualified because Europe, due to its aging demographics, must run a trade surplus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
    *   The Chinese Yuan is not viable due to its heavily manipulated nature and significant capital controls. Attempts to loosen these controls historically result in a flood of private savings leaving the country, forcing their re-imposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## Historical Examples of Global Currency Use

The reliance on a dominant currency has been consistent throughout history, even amidst political conflict:

*   **Spanish Currency in British Trade**: At the height of British-Spanish confrontations during the late Colonial period, the British almost exclusively used Spanish currency to facilitate their trade triangle involving slaves, rum, and finished goods between the Caribbean colonies, American colonies, and the British mainland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **U.S. Dollar During Vietnam War**: Even during the Vietnam War, the Vietnamese used the [[global_dominance_of_the_us_dollar | U.S. dollar]] for their international exchange due to a lack of viable alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Russian Sanctions and the Yuan**: More recently, Russia, under financial sanctions, attempted to shift petroleum earnings from Euros and Dollars into Chinese Yuan. However, when they tried to withdraw these funds, China was reluctant to take them back, leading to Russia losing tens of billions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. This highlights the [[challenges_of_establishing_alternative_global_currencies | challenges of establishing alternative global currencies]].
*   **British Pound in Early US History**: During the War of 1812, even as the British were close to destroying the United States, the U.S. internally used the British pound as its unit of exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

There is no historical precedent for the global unit of exchange being anything other than the currency of the global hegemon and largest economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

## Challenges to Alternative Currencies

Discussions about alternatives to the [[global_dominance_of_the_us_dollar | US dollar]] often arise, such as within the [[role_of_the_brics_in_global_currency_discussions | BRICS]] group (Brazil, Russia, India, China) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Despite the occasional meetings of [[role_of_the_brics_in_global_currency_discussions | BRICS]] leaders, no meaningful policy has emerged, largely because these countries do not extensively trade with one another (beyond all trading with China) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Proposed alternatives, such as a jointly managed currency or one based on the IMF's Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), face significant hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>:

*   **Lack of Trust**: Countries within such groupings are generally unwilling to use each other's currencies, as it would grant that nation an undue advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Insufficient Scale**: SDRs are merely an accounting fiction, not a currency or unit of exchange. They would need to expand by a factor of at least a thousand to manage global trade effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Future Prospects in a De-globalizing World

As the world potentially moves towards [[Global Economic System Transformation | de-globalization]] and more regional trade, the American position could actually entrench <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. While regional hegemons might emerge and attempt to enforce the use of their own currencies (e.g., Turkey and the Lira in the Eastern Mediterranean) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, other countries will likely resist this, preferring the more liquid, less politically problematic, non-manipulated, and stable [[global_dominance_of_the_us_dollar | US dollar]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This suggests the [[future_prospects_for_global_economic_systems | future prospects for global economic systems]] continue to favor the dollar as the global standard.

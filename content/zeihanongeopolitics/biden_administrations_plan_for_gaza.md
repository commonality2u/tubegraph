The Biden Administration has publicly committed to building a floating dock to service the [[israel_and_hamas_conflict_overview | Gaza]] territory, aiming to deliver humanitarian aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The objective is to provide enough throughput for at least 2 million meals per day, which would meet roughly one-third of the territory's food demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Context: Humanitarian Crisis in Gaza

[[israel_and_hamas_conflict_overview | Gaza]] is described as an "open air prison camp," completely dependent on aid as it grows no food itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Following the [[hamas_attacks_on_israel | October Hamas attacks on Israel]] that killed approximately 1,600 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, the Israeli counter-effort to root out Hamas has destroyed an estimated two-thirds of housing stock and more infrastructure within [[israel_and_hamas_conflict_overview | Gaza]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This has led to about 35,000 deaths among the [[israel_and_hamas_conflict_overview | Gaza]] population, exceeding 1% of the pre-war civilian population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The conflict is expected to worsen, with preparations for an assault in the southern part of the strip, where most of the population is now huddled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. [[israel_and_hamas_conflict_overview | Gaza]] is not self-sustaining, unable to generate its own energy or grow its own food, relying entirely on external aid, which has been severely restricted by Israeli blockades due to the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Plan Details and Military Involvement

The United States intends for the aid to be delivered via the floating dock, requiring a logistics team for small boat delivery to the dock, and then "boots on the ground" in [[israel_and_hamas_conflict_overview | Gaza]] to establish a truck distribution system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. The scale of this operation, providing 2 million meals daily, is much larger than the Berlin airlift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Since the UN cannot operate in a war zone like [[israel_and_hamas_conflict_overview | Gaza]], only the US military could manage such a distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This suggests a larger [[military_presence_and_aid_distribution_in_gaza | US military presence in and around Gaza]] than in the rest of the Middle East combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

Despite the significant [[military_presence_and_aid_distribution_in_gaza | military footprint]] in an area without strategic value to the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, the floating nature of the dock allows for rapid withdrawal of personnel, potentially within hours, unlike the Afghan evacuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. However, [[hamas_attacks_on_israel | Hamas]] remains active, and attacks on US forces are anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Implications for US Foreign Policy

The Biden Administration's plan, particularly the deployment of a [[military_presence_and_aid_distribution_in_gaza | US military presence in Gaza]], is perceived as a potential breach of the [[usisrael_relations | US-Israeli relationship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This move cuts to the core of Israeli survivability, and there is broad political support within Israel for the military operation in [[israel_and_hamas_conflict_overview | Gaza]], even among "left-wing peace nicks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. [[Benjamin Netanyahus political strategy | Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu]] has ignored calls for restraint, pursuing Israeli national interests, as he believes Israel cannot be secure while Hamas exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

This initiative may signal a broader [[us_policy_shift_in_the_middle_east | US policy shift in the Middle East]], potentially leading to a full pullout from the entire region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Such a disengagement would leave existing US allies, including Israel, Jordan, [[egypts_stance_on_the_gaza_conflict | Egypt]], Morocco, Tunisia, and the UAE, to manage regional security on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. It could also lead to the US cutting ties with Persian Gulf states like Saudi Arabia and the UAE due to their labor practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

In this potential [[us_policy_shift_in_the_middle_east | re-alignment]], Turkey emerges as the only viable alternative partner for the US in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. There have already been renewed diplomatic connections between the Biden Administration and Turkey, with discussions at the assistant defense secretary level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Turkey possesses the most powerful military in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>, making it a strategically viable and capable partner for a post-Israel, post-Saudi American position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

The commitment of the Biden Administration to this plan and its broader implications will become clearer once the dock is operational or if significant shifts in US-Turkish relations are observed, likely within the next two to three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

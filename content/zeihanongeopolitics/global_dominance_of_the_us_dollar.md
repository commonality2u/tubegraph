The idea that the United States is in its final years or months, and that a major political event will dethrone the US dollar as the [[potential_global_economic_impact_and_the_future_of_international_currency | Global Currency]], is a persistent conventional wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. However, this logic chain has historically been incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This narrative often stems from anti-American sentiment, lacking mathematical or historical basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Foundation of Dollar Dominance

The US dollar's position as the [[potential_global_economic_impact_and_the_future_of_international_currency | Global Currency]] is not the cause of US power, but rather a reflection of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. A global currency necessitates the ability to enforce stability and facilitate trade, even through force if required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The US Navy's power significantly underpins this, being approximately seven times more powerful than all other navies combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. When considering the Japanese and British fleets—the world's second and third most powerful expeditionary navies—as American allies for force projection, this factor exceeds 12 to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. From both strategic and economic viewpoints, the US dollar's position faces no immediate danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Challenges and Their Limitations

Periodically, speculation arises that nations will cease using the US dollar. Currently, much discussion centers on countries joining the [[role_of_the_brics_in_global_currency_discussions | BRICS]] group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### The [[role_of_the_brics_in_global_currency_discussions | BRICS]] Group

[[role_of_the_brics_in_global_currency_discussions | BRICS]] comprises four large developing economies: Brazil, Russia, India, and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Initially conceived by a finance professional in the 2000s, its primary purpose was to identify large countries with significant bond markets for potential group trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. While [[role_of_the_brics_in_global_currency_discussions | BRICS]] leaders meet, no significant policy has resulted, largely because these nations do not engage in substantial trade with each other, beyond their individual trade relationships with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The notion of other countries like South Africa, Argentina, or Saudi Arabia joining is considered uninteresting due to their lack of commonality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### Viability of Alternative Currencies

The conspiratorial argument suggests that if countries stop using the US dollar, the US will be "doomed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. However, this presumes an alternative would be adopted. A key challenge is that none of these nations wish to use each other's currencies, as it would grant undue advantage to the issuing country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

For example:
*   The Russian Ruble's claim to be a [[potential_global_economic_impact_and_the_future_of_international_currency | Global Currency]] is met with skepticism, as even Russians are reluctant to hold it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   The Chinese Yuan is the most manipulated currency in [[historical_context_of_global_currencies | human history]], with China printing two to five times more currency monthly than the US Federal Reserve did at the peak of its monetization programs in 2007-2008 and during Covid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Any attempt by China to loosen capital controls to promote the Yuan internationally results in hundreds of billions of dollars in private savings rapidly exiting the country, forcing them to re-impose controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

Another concept is a jointly managed currency, possibly based on the International Monetary Fund's Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. However, SDRs are not currencies; they are an accounting fiction created to centralize funds from various member locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. For SDRs to manage global trade, they would need to expand by at least a factor of one thousand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### Requirements for a Global Currency

To function as a [[potential_global_economic_impact_and_the_future_of_international_currency | Global Currency]], a currency must meet several stringent criteria:
*   **Immense Scale**: It must be vast enough to lubricate global exchange mechanisms, which operate in the tens of trillions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. The currency itself would need to be even larger than the trade volume it facilitates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Insensitivity to Fluctuations**: The issuing nation must be indifferent to daily fluctuations in its currency's value. A trade surge could cause demand for the currency to skyrocket and supply to plummet, leading to significant domestic economic distortions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Persistent Trade Deficit**: The issuing nation must maintain a consistent trade deficit to supply currency to everyone engaging in global trade, without requiring approval for each transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This rules out:
    *   **Europeans**: They cannot serve this role because their aging demographics necessitate running a trade surplus, meaning they will never be net importers again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
    *   **Chinese**: The Yuan is heavily manipulated, and any attempt to liberalize capital controls leads to massive capital flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## [[Historical context of global currencies | Historical Context]]

There is no historical precedent for the unit of exchange for global trade being anything other than the currency of the global hegemon and largest economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

*   During intense British-Spanish confrontations in the late Colonial period, the British almost exclusively used Spanish currency to facilitate their slave, rum, and finished goods trade triangle between the Caribbean, American colonies, and the British mainland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   At the height of the Vietnam War, the Vietnamese used the US dollar for international exchange because no other viable option existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   More recently, Russia attempted to convert petroleum earnings from Euros and Dollars into Chinese Yuan to circumvent sanctions. However, when they tried to withdraw these funds, the Chinese were unwilling to buy back the Yuan, leading to Russia losing tens of billions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   During the War of 1812, even as the British sought to destroy the United States, the US's internal unit of exchange was the British Pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

## Future Outlook

As the world potentially moves towards de-globalization and a [[global_economic_system_transformation | shift to regional trade]], the American dollar's position may become even more entrenched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Regional hegemons might attempt to impose their currencies, but other countries in their sphere of influence will likely resist. The US dollar, being more liquid, less politically problematic, stable, and not manipulated for trade advantages, will likely continue to be preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. For example, while Turkey might try to force the Lira as the central currency in the Eastern Mediterranean, Middle East, and Balkans, other nations will likely prefer the US dollar to avoid being bound too closely to Turkish economic policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

The recurring narrative about the dollar's demise continues to hold little weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

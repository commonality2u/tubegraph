From: [[zeihanongeopolitics]] <br/> 

Peter Zeihan forecasts that [[potential_collapse_of_chinese_economy_and_governance | China]] will not exist as an industrialized, unified nation-state within a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This timeline assumes no further complications, but the internal degradation of the government suggests it could happen much sooner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Such an event would render $35 trillion of industrial plant worthless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Consumers and businesses are advised to prepare to produce goods themselves if they currently rely on Chinese manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Drivers of Collapse

Zeihan identifies three primary factors contributing to [[chinas_industrial_and_political_challenges | China's industrial and political challenges]]: demographics, debt and holdings, and leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Demographics
[[chinas_economic_decline_and_consumer_spending | China]] has historically falsified its population data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. For 40-45 years, the one-child policy was in effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, with local governments inflating kindergarten numbers to secure subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The Shanghai Academy of Sciences, one of the few reliable data sources in [[potential_collapse_of_chinese_economy_and_governance | China]], now reports that the population has been overcounted by over 100 million people, primarily those under the age of 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

Official government updates and COVID-related data further indicate a drastic decline in birth rates, dropping by over half in the last five years, possibly closer to 70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Birth rates in major Chinese cities are now below 0.5, significantly lower than the 2.1 required for population replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The official data suggests that by the end of the decade, [[potential_collapse_of_chinese_economy_and_governance | China]] will lack sufficient workers under 50 to sustain a consumption or production-based system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Debt and Holdings
[[potential_collapse_of_chinese_economy_and_governance | China]] faces an immense debt crisis:
*   Local governments in [[potential_collapse_of_chinese_economy_and_governance | China]] have accumulated more than Mexico's total national debt annually for the past 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. These local governments, unable to raise taxes, rely on land sales (which are no longer viable) or state transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Their debt now stands at half the size of the United States' total national debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   Corporate debt in [[potential_collapse_of_chinese_economy_and_governance | China]] is 250% of GDP, more than triple the US total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   The Chinese government compels its citizens to keep savings domestically, which are then used to fuel this debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. As a result, 80-85% of an average Chinese citizen's personal holdings are in real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This has led to a surplus of 1.5 to 3 billion condos, enough housing for the entire Western Hemisphere and Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. The market value of these properties is estimated at only 10% of their face value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, effectively rendering the population's entire savings worthless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### Leadership
Chairman Xi Jinping has established an unprecedented cult of personality, far exceeding that of Mao Zedong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. He has systematically purged competent officials and leaders at all levels of government, including local leaders, political factions, academia, and the business community, to eliminate any potential challenges to his authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. This has led to the cessation of data collection on critical areas like land sales, bond markets, and political biographies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

This leadership style has created a severe disconnect in information flow and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. An example is the Chinese weather balloon incident: Xi Jinping was unaware of the balloon's existence until it was shot down over the US, and even [[potential_collapse_of_chinese_economy_and_governance | China]]'s Defense Ministry was uninformed until it was over US territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. This exemplifies a system where no one dares to speak truth to power, leading to decisions made in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

The combination of demographic collapse, insurmountable debt, and a dysfunctional government means [[potential_collapse_of_chinese_economy_and_governance | China]] faces multiple severe threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

## Global Impact and Opportunities

The [[impact_of_chinese_collapse_on_global_supply_chains_and_us_industrial_growth | collapse of the Chinese economy]] will lead to a [[deglobalization_and_its_impact_on_american_industry | deglobalization]] of industrial production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

### North America
For North America, this situation presents a significant opportunity:
*   **United States**: The US is poised for its fastest historical economic growth, even with minimal intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. The main priority for the US is capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. The retirement of Baby Boomers (aged 55-65), who hold 70% of global private capital, is causing a significant increase in capital costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. Capital costs have tripled in the last three years and are expected to triple again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.
*   **Mexico**: Mexico has an unprecedented chance for an overhaul of its infrastructure within the next six years, potentially leading to 20-30 years of Korean-style growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. While Northern Mexico already benefits from its trade relationship with Texas (80% of US-Mexico trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>), Central Mexico, with twice the population and labor availability, lacks the necessary heavy rail multimodal infrastructure for integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. Mexico needs its largest infrastructure buildout in history to connect Central Mexico's 60 million people to the rest of the continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.
*   **Canada**: Canada's primary focus should be processing raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. While [[potential_collapse_of_chinese_economy_and_governance | China]] currently handles most processing but has little ore, Canada possesses significant mineral reserves like lithium and platinum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. Canada's proactive immigration policies, targeting skilled individuals aged 15-35, have helped manage its demographic challenges and foster intellectual property development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.

### Other Regions
*   **Southeast Asia**: This region shows promise due to stable demographics (unlike [[potential_collapse_of_chinese_economy_and_governance | China]], Germany, or Italy) and existing industrial capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Thailand and Malaysia excel in mid-level tech manufacturing, while Vietnam has transformed its educational system, with 40% of its college graduates in STEM fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. However, Southeast Asia lacks physical integration among its countries and faces significant internal stresses due to uneven development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. ASEAN, as a political talk shop rather than an economic union, limits their ability to act as a unified front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   **Germany**: Germany is also facing its "last decade" due to its demographic situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.

### Manufacturing and Supply Chains
The end of [[chinas_economic_dependency_on_exports | China's economic dependency on exports]] and its role in global supply chains will necessitate a massive rebuilding of industrial capacity in North America. This will be inflationary and expensive, but necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

*   **Textiles**: The US demonstrated adaptability during COVID-19 by re-establishing textile manufacturing in North Carolina, using automation to achieve lower per-item costs than traditional methods in Bangladesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.
*   **Electronics**: The electronics sector, particularly electronic products, faces the greatest disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. East Asia's electronics supply chain relies on a complex network of differentiated labor and skill sets across multiple countries for various components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. North America currently lacks this diversity of skill sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>.
*   **Semiconductors**: There are three classes of semiconductors:
    *   **90 nanometer to 10 nm**: Used in non-cutting-edge smartphones, televisions, cars, and most laptops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>. This segment has a deep, competitive ecosystem across a dozen countries, making it resilient to regional disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>.
    *   **90 nanometer and Dumber (analog chips, IoT)**: 80% of this production is in [[potential_collapse_of_chinese_economy_and_governance | China]] and is expected to break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>.
    *   **10 nanometer and Better (high-end smartphones, satellite communications, smart grid, AI, EVs, national security)**: Primarily produced in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>. However, the fabrication facilities rely on a supply chain of 9,000 companies globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>. If even one country is removed from this chain, the entire system stops. Germany is a particular concern in this regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>. Rebuilding this high-end semiconductor ecosystem outside of its current structure will take a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:48">[00:33:48]</a>.

North America's collective resources, including the US's shale revolution (providing 300 years of natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>), Mexico's manufacturing capabilities, and Canada's processing potential, are crucial for this re-industrialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. The US and Mexico are "stapled together at the hip" and will need each other for this transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.

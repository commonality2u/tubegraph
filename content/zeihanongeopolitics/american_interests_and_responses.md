## Initial US Stance on Gaza

Prior to the October 13th, 2023, events, the United States' intelligence and military focus was primarily on the [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_us_interests | Ukraine zone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>, including areas between Moscow and Kyiv, to support the war effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

The US had a policy of outsourcing issues to local authorities in regions where it lacked a direct national interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. Israel, being a capable country, largely managed its own affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. The US held "zero interest in Gaza" because the area had no economic significance, was not on transport routes, lacked resources, and was not a manufacturing or intellectual hub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.

## Shift in US Focus and National Interest

The situation changed dramatically with the kidnapping of American citizens and their transport into Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. This development transformed Gaza into a direct US concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. A fundamental aspect of the American social contract is the commitment to retrieve its citizens: "no matter who you are no matter where you are no matter what you have done we will send the Marines for you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

The challenge in fulfilling this commitment is the lack of intelligence regarding the hostages' locations, exacerbated by the significant intelligence failure of the Israelis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

## US Response Strategies

### Direct Military and Intelligence Efforts
The US will dedicate "every eye and every ear that you can spare" to Gaza to locate the kidnapped Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. Although this is a substantial resource expenditure for a limited number of individuals, it is considered a necessary action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. Once locations are identified, Special Forces and potentially a Marine Group will be deployed to extract them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

### Engagement with Iran
Given the theory that Iran may have influenced the timing of the assault, the US may seek to leverage Iran's potential access to the perpetrators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. The principle of intelligence dictates that information must be sought from those who possess it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. Since the individuals who carried out the attacks are associated with the Iranian government, Tehran is identified as one of the very few places where the US can obtain information to guide its special forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

Regardless of opinions on the [[political_dynamics_and_alliances_in_the_united_states_and_its_implications | Trump Administration or the Biden Administration or American approaches to the Middle East in general]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>, there is now a clear and pressing reason for the US to engage with Iran to secure the information needed to fulfill its "most basic, sacred social contracts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

For the US, retrieving its citizens is now the primary objective, making the broader situation in Gaza secondary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. This process is expected to be difficult and fraught with challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

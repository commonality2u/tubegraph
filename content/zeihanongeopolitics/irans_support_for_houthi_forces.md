## Iran's Support for Houthi Forces

An [[houthi_insurgency_in_yemen | insurgency]] has been ongoing in [[houthi_insurgency_in_yemen | Yemen]] for decades, involving a relatively secular government, a Sunni militia unofficially affiliated with Al-Qaeda, and a Shiite group known as the Houthis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. [[houthi_insurgency_in_yemen | Yemen]] itself has little of economic value, with natural gas businesses having largely exited years ago and much agricultural production dedicated to qat, a mild narcotic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### Nature of Iranian Support

[[irans_political_objectives_and_actions | Iran]] specifically backs the Houthis in this multi-sided conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The Houthis are incapable of manufacturing their own weapons, so all their armaments are supplied by [[irans_political_objectives_and_actions | Iran]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Since a 2022 ceasefire agreed upon by the Saudis and Houthis, the Houthis, with [[irans_political_objectives_and_actions | Iran's]] assistance, have been stockpiling weapons in anticipation of renewed hostilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

### Strategic Objectives

[[irans_political_objectives_and_actions | Iran]] supports the Houthis due to [[houthi_insurgency_in_yemen | Yemen's]] location on the far side of Saudi Arabia, which is [[irans_political_ob`jectives_and_actions | Iran's]] regional rival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The [[irans_political_objectives_and_actions | Iranians]] often use the Houthis as a proxy to launch missiles and drones at Saudi targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

[[irans_political_objectives_and_actions | Iran]] has a stronger support relationship with the Houthis than with [[hezbollahs_position_on_the_israel_hamas_conflict | Hamas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. While [[hezbollahs_position_on_the_israel_hamas_conflict | Hamas]] is Sunni and Arab, the [[irans_political_objectives_and_actions | Iranians]] are largely Persian and Shia, leading them to view [[hezbollahs_position_on_the_israel_hamas_conflict | Hamas]] as disposable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. The Houthis, being Shia, share more camaraderie with [[irans_political_objectives_and_actions | Iran]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

From [[irans_political_objectives_and_actions | Iran's]] perspective, needling Saudi Arabia is a more strategically important objective than needling Israel, which is seen as convenient and good for PR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. [[irans_political_objectives_and_actions | Iran]] prefers to keep the Houthis focused on Saudi Arabia, as that is where their primary future conflict is anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. [[irans_political_objectives_and_actions | Iran]] also desires the United States to stay out of the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. While [[irans_political_objectives_and_actions | Iran]] engages in actions that needle the United States and Israel for good PR across the Middle East, it is not willing to "bleed for it," reserving its assets for its real strategic fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

### Impact on Red Sea Shipping

In the aftermath of the October 7th assault on Israeli targets by [[hezbollahs_position_on_the_israel_hamas_conflict | Hamas]], the Houthis began launching missiles and drones at international shipping in the Red Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The Houthis claim these attacks target ships affiliated with Israel, but in practice, they shoot at anything passing through, as they lack effective identification methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. These actions have disrupted 12% of global trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

On January 12th, the [[us_air_assault_on_houthi_targets | United States launched a moderate-sized Air Assault]] on Houthi targets, including command and control systems, radar, and most notably, ammo dumps and processing facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This strike was precipitated by the Houthis launching a ballistic anti-ship missile at a US Naval asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. The US response indicates that while shipping disruption is a concern, direct targeting of a naval vessel triggers a more immediate and forceful military reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

The recent [[brics_summit_and_its_significance | BRICS summit]] in South Africa aimed to formulate plans and consider new members, though initial expectations suggested it would "amount to nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>.

## Origins and Initial Structure of BRICS

BRICS was never a grouping founded by its members; rather, it was conceived by a finance professional who identified Brazil, Russia, India, and China as significant bond markets due to available capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:30">[00:58:30]</a>. South Africa was later included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Historically, the group has not facilitated "meaningful deal[s]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a> among its members. While a Development Bank was formed, over 90% of its capital originates from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

## [[internal_conflicts_and_diverse_interests_within_brics | Lack of Cohesion Among Original Members]]

Beyond trade relations with China, member countries like Brazil, South Africa, and Russia exhibit minimal trade with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. India, a "special case," is notable for its dislike of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Discussions about forming a [[role_of_the_brics_in_global_currency_discussions | global currency]] to challenge the U.S. dollar consistently falter when details are addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. India, China, South Africa, and the BRICS-owned bank have explicitly stated they are "not interested in a Global Currency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. Only Russia, advocating for the ruble, and Brazil, with its "La Dee Da" foreign policy, maintain interest in such a currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

## [[relation_between_brics_countries_and_their_global_strategic_goals | Diverse Agendas of Original Members]]

At the summit, each BRICS nation presented its own "list of Grievances and desires" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>:
*   **Russia**: Sought support for a boycott of the West until its demands regarding Ukraine are met, while insisting on its own right to trade freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. This highlights [[strategic_and_diplomatic_implications_for_russia | strategic and diplomatic implications for Russia]].
*   **China**: Aimed to gather enough countries to demand trade concessions from Washington, valuing other nations purely for its own gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   **India**: Maintained a non-aligned stance, but has increasingly leaned towards the American camp due to China's assertiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.
*   **South Africa**: As host, claimed neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
*   **Brazil**: Maintained a "very la di da" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a> approach.

## Historical Precedent: The Non-Aligned Movement

Many of the countries now showing interest in BRICS were part of the Non-Aligned Movement during the Cold War, seeking a "new international economic order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. This movement aimed for the West to restructure trade practices to benefit former colonies. While this eventually led to preferential trade access for Africa, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) countries in European markets, it did not achieve the desired restructuring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. The current context presents even greater diversity of interests than the post-colonial era, making broad agreement challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.

## BRICS Expansion: New Members and Their Implications

The BRICS summit decided to expand its membership by adding six countries: Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Ethiopia, and Argentina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. This expansion indicates to some observers that BRICS "has no plans of doing anything useful in the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.

### Oil-Producing Nations: Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Iran
The addition of Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Iran has led to claims that BRICS now controls "about half to 60 percent of global oil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>, potentially leading to the "downfall of the dollar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a> and the end of the petrodollar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. However, this view is largely dismissed as "absolute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

*   While Saudi Arabia and Russia sell some oil in yuan or rupees, this is often to bypass sanctions or as a means to secure defense assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.
*   Saudi Arabia and the UAE are exploring non-U.S. dollar transactions primarily due to concerns about U.S. disengagement from the region and a desire for security guarantees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>. Their past use of the U.S. dollar was based on a bilateral security relationship with the U.S., not participation in a caucus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>. Current trilateral negotiations involving the U.S., Saudis, and Israelis underscore the Saudis' priority for security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>. China lacks the capacity to deploy military assistance at a level the Saudis would accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>, especially given Iran as a primary concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>.
*   The simultaneous addition of Iran, Saudi Arabia, and UAE ensures that future decisions on "all significant issues" within BRICS will face "diametrically opposed positions forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>, making a meaningful energy policy impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.

### Other New Members
*   **Ethiopia**: Brings "very little to the table," being one of the world's poorest landlocked countries and even excluded from China's One Belt, One Road initiative due to lack of investment potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. It was added primarily for "African Flair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.
*   **Argentina**: Characterized by an "entitlement complex" and a desire to avoid debt repayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. It joined BRICS hoping for Chinese financial assistance, not out of anti-U.S. dollar sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. Argentina is seen as a "drain on the organization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.
*   **Egypt**: Primarily functions as a U.S. satellite state, receiving U.S. payments to maintain peace with Israel and Jordan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>. Its inclusion might be attributed to India's lingering affinity for the non-aligned movement, where Egypt once held political significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.

## [[potential_geopolitical_shifts | Future Prospects of an Expanded BRICS]]

Organizational expansion typically leads to one of two outcomes: dominance by an overwhelmingly powerful member (e.g., the U.S. in NATO) or paralysis due to diverse viewpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>. BRICS is firmly in the latter category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>.

For BRICS to become significant, two scenarios are considered:
1.  **China subsidizes everything**: This would involve China covering the costs of members like Argentina and Ethiopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>. This is deemed "not very likely," as similar attempts by the Soviet Union in the 1970s "broke the bank" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>.
2.  **Rapid expansion into a "new non-aligned movement"**: This is also unlikely, as China and Russia have "very clear" nationalist and domineering goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>. While many countries in the Global South have not condemned Russia's actions in Ukraine, they are unlikely to follow Russia or become pawns in a Chinese-led alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the Chinese perspective, as evidenced by President Xi Jinping's absence from some opening ceremonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>, suggests that BRICS is primarily a "useful vehicle except rhetorically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>, implying it should not be treated as anything more impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>.

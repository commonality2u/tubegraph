From: [[zeihanongeopolitics]] <br/> 

While there is no definitive "smoking gun," [[irans_political_objectives_and_actions|Iran]] is considered a likely suspect in the recent conflict due to timing and the nature of supplies used by Hamas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Motivation for Involvement

The primary motivation for [[irans_political_objectives_and_actions|Iran's]] suspected involvement is to disrupt a normalization process between Saudi Arabia and Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. This potential alliance would have united economically powerful Arab nations with Israel, creating a formidable opposition bloc against [[irans_political_objectives_and_actions|Iran]] throughout the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

[[irans_political_objectives_and_actions|Iran]], being predominantly Shia and Persian, faces a regional landscape largely composed of Sunni Arabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Had the normalization succeeded, Israel would have been able to leverage its relationships within the Arab world to contain [[irans_political_objectives_and_actions|Iran]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## Relationship with Hamas

Despite suspected influence, Hamas is not a direct proxy of [[irans_political_objectives_and_actions|Iran]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Hamas operates for its own reasons, shaped by its position in Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

It is believed that [[irans_political_objectives_and_actions|Iran]] views Palestinians as "animals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Given the religious and ethnic divides (Hamas is Sunni and Arab, while [[irans_political_objectives_and_actions|Iran]] is Shia and Persian), [[irans_political_objectives_and_actions|Iran]] officially considers Hamas and Arabs in general to be apostates worthy of elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. This suggests that [[irans_political_objectives_and_actions|Iran]] would readily abandon Hamas if a beneficial deal were offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

## US Perspective and Engagement

The United States did not foresee the Hamas attack, as its intelligence focus has largely been on the [[iranian_participation_in_the_ukraine_conflict|Ukraine conflict]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. The U.S. has minimal economic interest in Gaza and typically defers to Israel on matters concerning the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

However, the kidnapping of American citizens into Gaza has created a direct [[us_military_involvement_and_middle_eastern_politics|U.S. national interest]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. Due to Israel's intelligence failure, the U.S. lacks information on the hostages' whereabouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.

Given the theory that [[irans_political_objectives_and_actions|Iran]] influenced the timing of the assault, they are considered the only entity with meaningful access to the groups who carried out the attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. This situation creates a compelling reason for the U.S. to engage directly with [[irans_political_objectives_and_actions|Iran]] (in Tehran) to gather information necessary to retrieve its citizens, making such engagement a primary objective, secondary only to what occurs in the rest of Gaza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

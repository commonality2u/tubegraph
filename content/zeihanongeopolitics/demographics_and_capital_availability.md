The Federal Reserve's monetary policy is significantly influenced by underlying demographic shifts, particularly concerning [[capital_availability_and_its_effects_on_technology_development | capital availability]] [00:03:39]. Despite Wall Street's expectations for rate cuts, the Federal Reserve does not appear interested, with the personal consumption expenditures index (PCE)—the Fed's preferred inflation measure—ticking up to 2.7% on April 26th [00:00:07]. It is suggested that rate cuts are unlikely, and rate increases are more probable for the next two to five years [00:00:44].

## Inflation Context

Much of the recent inflation has been linked to COVID-related consumption shifts [00:00:52]. Each change in demand, whether due to openings, closings, new variants, or vaccines, required supply chains to retool [00:01:07]. This adjustment period for supply chains typically takes 18 to 24 months [00:01:22]. While inflation has steadily decreased from a peak of around 9% to approximately 3% as supply chains caught up [00:01:58], it is now leveling off [00:02:03]. This 3% rate is likely the new normal for inflation lows, not the average [00:02:20]. Unless the Fed's mandate changes, interest rates are not expected to fall below current levels; they are more likely to rise [00:02:27].

## Federal Reserve's Stance on Wall Street

The Federal Reserve views Wall Street as having been irresponsible with substantial capital inflows, attributing the dot-com and subprime crashes to this behavior [00:02:45]. The Fed needed 10 years to rebuild the financial sector after each catastrophe [00:03:01]. Consequently, what Wall Street deems necessary for its business plans does not necessarily align with the needs of the United States' real economy from the Fed's perspective [00:03:13]. There might be an element of "spiteful revenge" in the Federal Reserve's decisions regarding Wall Street's desires [00:03:26].

## Demographics as a Core Driver of Capital Availability

The primary independent reason for current monetary policy considerations is [[demographic_shifts_and_economic_implications | demographics]] [00:03:39].

### The Capital-Rich Phase
Individuals are at their most [[capital_availability_and_its_effects_on_technology_development | capital rich]] between the ages of 45 and 65, particularly from 55 to 65 [00:03:44]. During this phase, children are typically moving out, houses are being paid down, and individuals are saving for retirement [00:03:47]. Income is also at its highest due to decades of job experience [00:03:53]. This age group is the source of all private capital [00:04:02].

### The Baby Boomer Impact (2000-2020)
The Baby Boomers, the largest generation in human history globally, significantly influenced [[capital_availability_and_its_effects_on_technology_development | capital availability]] [00:04:08]. The oldest Baby Boomers turned 45 in 1990, and the youngest will turn 65 and retire by 2030, liquidating their savings into low-velocity investments [00:04:20].

From approximately 2000 to 2020, most Baby Boomers were in their [[capital_availability_and_its_effects_on_technology_development | capital-rich]] phase [00:04:34]. This period saw the highest [[capital_availability_and_its_effects_on_technology_development | capital availability]] on both American and global bases, resulting in the lowest [[capital_availability_and_its_effects_on_technology_development | capital costs]] ever recorded [00:04:44]. The sheer volume of Baby Boomer capital was more than the United States could metabolize domestically [00:04:59]. This led to the rise of an entire financial class dedicated to developing new financial products to utilize this capital, much of which was sent abroad [00:05:04].

During the same period (2000-2020), China's economy also flourished [00:05:15]. While less reliant on private savings, China's central bank extensively used monetization (currency printing) [00:05:24]. For 20 years, an enormous amount of capital flowed out of the United States and China, making the financial sector and its professionals essential for managing this wealth [00:05:45].

### Current and Future Capital Scarcity
This wave of abundant capital is now diminishing [00:06:04]. The vast majority of Baby Boomers have retired, and the remainder will exit the system within the next five to six years, leading to the depletion of their active capital [00:06:07]. This capital transforms into low-velocity investments like T-bills and cash [00:06:13].

The subsequent generation, Gen X, is smaller in number [00:06:19]. The next large generation, the Millennials, will not enter their [[capital_availability_and_its_effects_on_technology_development | capital-rich]] period for another 10 to 12 years [00:06:22]. This timeline is further extended by the fact that Millennials have generally delayed major life milestones, such as having children, buying homes, or getting married, by about six years compared to previous generations [00:06:29].

Consequently, there is significantly less free capital available, implying a reduced need for a large financial sector [00:06:40].

## Implications for Interest Rates and the Economy

The Federal Reserve recognizes that with less capital, demand is falling [00:06:51]. As the U.S. rapidly disentangles itself from global supply chains due to deglobalization, there's a skyrocketing demand for American employment, capital, and materials [00:07:19]. This necessitates building a new industrial infrastructure, which is expensive and drives demand and inflation [00:07:33]. While this is considered "productive inflation" because it builds essential industrial plant for future generations [00:07:51], it contributes to higher costs.

Until the Federal Reserve's mandate changes or this new industrial plant is built, and until another large capital-generating class (Millennials) reaches their 50s, a world of 2% inflation is unattainable, especially if interest rates are lowered [00:08:00]. The phrase "higher for longer" means that significant relief in [[capital_availability_and_its_effects_on_technology_development | capital costs]] is not expected for another decade [00:08:18]. Therefore, current [[capital_availability_and_its_effects_on_technology_development | capital costs]], despite having quadrupled in the last five years, are still the cheapest they will be until the mid-2030s [00:08:39].

Belgorod, a significant logistical hub and population center on the Russian side of the border, has become a pivotal target in the Ukraine war due to its strategic importance for Russian military operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The recent lifting of Western restrictions on the use of supplied weapons on Russian territory has dramatically shifted the balance of power, allowing Ukraine to target military assets within the Belgorod area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Historical and Current Russian Operations

Early in the war, forces originating from Belgorod launched a massive assault on Kharkiv, nearly capturing the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Ukrainian counter-offensives about a year into the war pushed Russian forces back to the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. More recently, Russia renewed its attempts to overwhelm Ukrainian defenses near Kharkiv using large numbers of T-62 tanks, suffering horrific casualty ratios of 5-6 to 1 against Ukrainian forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

From Belgorod, Russia has consistently launched waves of artillery and missile attacks targeting Kharkiv City, including its power grid and logistical hubs, causing significant hardship for the civilian population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Russia had been relying on the understanding that Western weapons supplied to Ukraine could not be used on the Russian side of the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Ukrainian Countermeasures and Tactical Impact

In a significant shift, Western restrictions on the use of weapons on the Russian side of the border have been lifted, at least for the Kharkiv axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Within 24 to 36 hours of this change, Ukraine began targeting all military significant assets in the Belgorod area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This includes artillery positions, air defense sites, [[impact_on_russian_ammunition_depots | ammo dumps]], fuel depots, and rail yards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

This targeting of Belgorod has immediate tactical implications:
*   **Disruption of Russian Assaults:** Russia had committed considerable resources to the assault on Kharkiv, and with their [[consequences_for_russian_logistics_and_transport | logistical hub]] in Belgorod now being "obliterated," a significant Ukrainian counter-offensive is anticipated within days to weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Liquidation of Firepower:** Russian forces in the area will struggle to receive reinforcements, equipment, ammunition, and fuel, leading to a potential "significant liquidation" of Russian military firepower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. They will likely be forced to retreat towards the Russian border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Strategic Significance

The neutralization of Belgorod is crucial for Ukraine's long-term security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. It has always been a primary [[russian_geographic_and_strategic_military_objectives | military node]] for the Russians, serving as the closest population and [[significance_of_logistics_and_infrastructure_in_warfare | logistical hub]] to the Ukrainian border for launching new assaults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. For Ukraine to emerge as an independent state with security, Belgorod must be neutralized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

While current attacks are significant, it is unlikely they will be enough to permanently neutralize Belgorod without Ukrainian ground forces crossing the border, which is currently considered beyond their capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Comparison with Rostov-on-Don
> Another crucial [[strategic_implications_of_russian_military_logistics_disruption | logistical hub]] is Rostov-on-Don, which serves the southern and southeastern fronts of Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Rostov-on-Don is much further from the front lines than Belgorod, making it harder for Western weapons to reach meaningfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. If Rostov could be neutralized, the Crimean Peninsula's supply lines would be cut, potentially allowing it to fall back to Ukrainian control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

The decision to lift restrictions on targeting Russian territory followed an assessment that Russia's threats of retaliation, often voiced by figures like Dmitry Medvedev, were not serious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This breaking of the "seal" means Western nations are expected to further liberalize restrictions on Ukrainian use of military equipment to target Russian military assets anywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. This shift reflects a growing realization in Europe that the war needs to be taken more seriously in terms of finance, equipment, policy, and troop deployment to achieve a favorable conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

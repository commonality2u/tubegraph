In March 2023, the United States experienced a "banking hiccup," with three notable banks—Silvergate, Signature, and Silicon Valley Bank—either collapsing or being closed by regulators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Silicon Valley Bank was the 16th largest bank in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This event is not considered a cause for widespread concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

This situation is unlike the [[comparison_of_2023_banking_hiccup_to_2007_financial_crisis | financial crisis of 2007]], which saw the top ten banks facing significant trouble simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

Typically, financial crises arise from problems with loans, where rising capital costs make previous loans unfeasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. In 2007, the issue was subprime loans, affecting a half-trillion to two-and-a-half trillion dollars in the real estate market, impacting nearly every bank in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The realization that individuals with no income had qualified for 100% mortgages on million-dollar homes led to widespread problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

In 2023, there is no similar widespread loan problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. While there has been an expansion with cheap capital, and some issues need resolving, the current situation is more akin to the financial system "taking out the trash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Some bank failures are expected and do not necessarily signal systemic risk or broad contagion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The overall national banking system is not experiencing a broad bank run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## [[role_of_fdic_in_banking_stability | Role of the FDIC]]

The United States has the [[role_of_fdic_in_banking_stability | Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)]], where banks contribute monthly fees to insure depositors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Deposits under $250,000 are federally guaranteed, meaning depositors will be made whole without direct government intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Specific Causes of 2023 Failures

### Connection to [[impact_of_tech_industry_on_recent_banking_failures | Tech Industry]]

The three banks that failed in March 2023 were all connected to the [[impact_of_tech_industry_on_recent_banking_failures | tech sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The [[impact_of_tech_industry_on_recent_banking_failures | tech industry]], especially newer and startup firms, is capital-intensive and often focuses on future profits rather than current income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. When capital costs rise, these companies face problems, which in turn impacts the banks catering to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

Furthermore, the [[impact_of_tech_industry_on_recent_banking_failures | tech sector]] experienced a boom in 2020 and 2021 (and to a lesser extent in 2022) due to increased demand for tech products during the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This boom was inevitably followed by a bust as consumers updated their devices and reduced subsequent purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

### Deposit Issues, Not Loans

Unlike typical bank failures, the problem for these banks was not primarily on the loan side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Tech startups primarily obtain capital directly from venture capitalists, not traditional bank loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. As venture capitalists had less capital to invest, startups drew down their cash deposits at these banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This reduction in deposits meant banks lacked sufficient operating capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. This characteristic limits the overall financial sector's exposure, as loan selling among banks is less prevalent in this scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

## [[biden_administrations_response_to_banking_issues_and_moral_hazard | Biden Administration's Response]]

The [[biden_administrations_response_to_banking_issues_and_moral_hazard | Biden Administration]] intervened because many small startups had deposits exceeding the $250,000 FDIC insurance limit, particularly at Silicon Valley Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. The administration declared that all depositors would be made whole by the FDIC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This will be funded by other banks paying slightly higher fees into the FDIC system, ensuring taxpayers do not bear the cost of the bailout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

This response effectively halts any immediate risk of a bank run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. However, it also introduces [[biden_administrations_response_to_banking_issues_and_moral_hazard | moral hazard]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. By guaranteeing all deposits, it may encourage companies that made poor financial decisions (such as concentrating uninsured deposits in one bank) to continue doing so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This effectively shifts the cost to all bank customers through potentially lower interest rates or stricter loan conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

The early 21st century has witnessed significant advancements in fertility technologies, coinciding with and often driven by evolving demographic trends, particularly the tendency towards later parenthood. These technologies offer new possibilities for family planning and disease prevention, while also raising complex societal and ethical questions.

## Current Fertility Technologies and Their Demographic Impact

### In Vitro Fertilization (IVF)
IVF has become a widespread solution for millions of families globally, often utilized due to fertility challenges or the increasing age of mothers, typically women in their 30s or 40s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. The process often involves hormone stimulation, leading to the production of multiple eggsâ€”ranging from 5-20 for typical IVF patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a> to as many as 60-100 eggs for young, hormonally stimulated egg donors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. These eggs are then fertilized, creating multiple embryos and presenting families with the "embryo choice problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

The impact of IVF is notable in several developed countries. For instance, in Denmark, one in ten babies is born through IVF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>. In the United States, approximately 3-5% of births involve IVF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:48">[01:29:48]</a>. The prevalence of IVF has made companies in this sector, such as those specializing in embryo selection, an investment avenue with exposure to trends like "demographic collapse" or delayed family formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:37">[01:29:37]</a>.

### Embryo Selection and Genomic Prediction
Building upon IVF, companies like Genomic Prediction offer services to analyze the genetic makeup of embryos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. By genotyping embryos from small biopsies, these services can predict risks for various conditions, such as breast cancer or cardiovascular disease, allowing parents to select embryos with lower genetic predispositions to such illnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. Genomic Prediction currently works with 200-300 IVF clinics across six continents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. The aim is to improve health outcomes, potentially increasing "disability adjusted life years" (DALYs); for example, selection from 10 embryos might add four healthy years to a life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">[00:36:28]</a>. Current applications are focused on health-related traits rather than cosmetic or non-medical "edgy stuff" like height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>.

### Egg Donation
Egg donation is a significant part of the fertility landscape, particularly for individuals or couples unable to use their own eggs. Egg donors are typically young women (e.g., 22-23 years old) who undergo hormone stimulation to produce a large number of eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:20">[01:35:20]</a>. The high yield of eggs from young donors (potentially 60-100 per cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:45">[01:35:45]</a>) contrasts with the often lower yields from older women undergoing IVF for their own fertility, highlighting the impact of age on egg quantity and the potential for greater selection when more eggs are available.

## Future Fertility Technologies

The field of fertility technology is rapidly advancing, with several innovations on the horizon that could further reshape demographic and reproductive landscapes.

### Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) for Gamete Production
Technology to convert somatic cells (like skin cells) into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and then differentiate them into gametes (eggs or sperm) is progressing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:24">[01:37:24]</a>. This process, known as in vitro gametogenesis (IVG), has been largely mastered in animal models like mice and rats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:02">[01:38:02]</a>, and human application is considered a matter of years, with startups actively working on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:26">[01:38:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:34">[01:38:34]</a>. IVG could theoretically overcome the limitation of egg availability, potentially allowing for the creation and selection from thousands of embryos for a given couple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:36">[01:39:36]</a>. However, initial adoption might face trepidation due to the novelty of the process compared to using naturally sourced eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:05">[01:39:05]</a>.

### Gene Editing
Technologies like CRISPR are expected to mature for massively multiplexed edits within approximately a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:08">[00:41:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:03">[01:40:03]</a>. If gene editing becomes safe and effective on a similar timescale to IVG, it might offer a more direct route to modifying embryos for desired traits or disease resistance, potentially supplanting the need for large-scale embryo creation via IVG for selection purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:10">[01:40:10]</a>.

### Iterated Embryo Selection
This more speculative technology involves creating embryos, selecting the "best" ones, and then using those selected embryos to create a new generation of embryos for further selection, all without an intermediate human generation growing to reproductive age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:55">[01:40:55]</a>. While considered plausible, there is less active research in this specific area currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:29">[01:41:29]</a>.

### Genomic Matching in Mate Selection
There has been speculation, and even early patent applications by companies like 23andMe, about using genomic information to advise on mate selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>. Future dating apps could potentially incorporate features where users upload their genomes to assess genetic complementarity for traits like intelligence or even provide DNA-verified information such as height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>.

## Societal and Ethical Considerations

The increasing sophistication and accessibility of fertility technologies bring forth numerous societal and ethical debates.

### Adoption Rates and Accessibility
There is debate about the ultimate uptake of these technologies. While some, like commentator Gwern, express pessimism about widespread adoption, citing factors like societal hostility, the complexities of advanced family planning, financial costs, and the arduous nature of IVF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:10">[01:25:10]</a>, current trends show significant use. Already, 10% of babies in Denmark and 3-5% in the US are born via IVF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:48">[01:29:48]</a>. It's argued that families already undergoing IVF will likely opt for advanced genetic screening if the marginal cost is low, especially as the technology for genotyping embryos can become a cloud-based data analysis service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:29">[01:28:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>.

### Concerns about Inequality
A major concern is that these technologies could exacerbate societal inequalities, potentially leading to a future reminiscent of H.G. Wells' Morlocks and Eloi, where a genetic divide separates societal classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:40">[01:43:40]</a>. Initially, the benefits of advanced techniques like gene editing or extensive embryo selection might be accessible only to the wealthy (e.g., "Elon Musk like people" or "Trump grandchildren") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:59">[00:54:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>. A potential countermeasure could be the integration of these technologies into national healthcare systems, making them freely available, similar to how countries like Denmark and Israel cover IVF for infertile couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a>. Such systems could even theoretically redistribute resources to allow "below average" families greater access to these enhancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:49">[01:44:49]</a>.

### Regulation and Global Access
The nature of these technologies, especially if they evolve into data-driven cloud services, will make regulation challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:38">[00:49:38]</a>. Individuals in countries with restrictive laws might still access services from vendors in more permissive jurisdictions. Nations may adopt divergent approaches, with some banning these technologies and others providing universal free access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a>.

### Shifting Perspectives on "Enhancement"
Historical perspectives on improving human populations have varied. Many early 20th-century progressives, including figures like Margaret Sanger, advocated for what would today be termed eugenics, believing in societal responsibility to promote healthy reproduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">[01:09:10]</a>. This contrasts sharply with contemporary "wokeist" views, which often express hostility towards such technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">[01:09:10]</a>. Interestingly, in East Asia, including Communist China, the concept equivalent to "eugenics" (often translated as "healthy production") is viewed positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>. The underlying goals of healthier, longer-lived populations are arguably progressive, yet the means to achieve them through genetic technologies are contentious [[ethical_implications_of_genetic_selection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:46">[01:41:46]</a>.

## Conclusion
Fertility technologies are at a pivotal juncture, driven by demographic shifts and scientific breakthroughs [[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society]]. They offer unprecedented control over reproduction and the genetic makeup of future generations. While the potential benefits for individual and public health are immense, these advancements also necessitate careful consideration of their ethical implications, accessibility, and potential to reshape society. The ongoing dialogue will be crucial in navigating the path forward as these transformative technologies continue to evolve.

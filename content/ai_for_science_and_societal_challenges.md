Demis Hassabis, CEO of DeepMind, emphasizes the significant role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in advancing scientific discovery and addressing major societal problems. This forms a core part of DeepMind's mission and Hassabis's personal passion [[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | Impact of AI on future technology and society]]. The development of AI tools for science is seen not only as a way to achieve breakthroughs but also as a method to "battle test" AI concepts and ensure their real-world applicability [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_deploying_ai_at_scale | Challenges and opportunities in deploying AI at scale]].

## Current Applications and Successes

DeepMind has pioneered several AI systems that have made notable contributions to various scientific fields:

*   **AlphaFold:** This system has achieved "amazing science" by predicting protein structures, a significant challenge in biology. AlphaFold's success has been widely recognized and its findings published [[open_source_ai_models_and_their_implications | Open source AI models and their implications]]. It serves as an example of a specialized system making impactful contributions.
*   **Health and Drug Discovery:** AI is seen as a tool for "incredible breakthroughs in health". DeepMind's spin-out, Isomorphic Labs, aims to leverage AI to accelerate drug discovery and potentially cure terrible diseases [[the_impact_of_ai_and_quantum_computing_on_industries_like_gaming_and_healthcare | The impact of AI and quantum computing on industries like gaming and healthcare]].
*   **Mathematical and Scientific Discovery:** AI systems are contributing to broader "mathematical and scientific discovery" [[implications_of_ai_on_future_scientific_advancements | Implications of AI on future scientific advancements]]. This includes systems like AlphaCode for coding and theorem proving systems, with ongoing progress in math and coding domains.
*   **Weather Prediction:** GraphCast, a weather prediction system, is another example of DeepMind's open-sourced contributions to science.
*   **Material Science:** DeepMind has also published work in material science, showcasing AI's versatility [[scientific_and_technological_developments_in_ai | Scientific and technological developments in AI]].
*   **Assisting Scientists:** Current AI systems can help the "best human scientists make their breakthroughs quicker" by, for example, triaging the search space for potential solutions [[ai_potential_impact_on_software_and_application_development | AI's potential impact on software and application development]]. They are suitable for searching large combinatorial spaces when a problem and a clear objective function can be specified.

## Future Potential and Societal Impact

Hassabis expresses optimism about AI's capacity to solve some of humanity's most significant challenges:

*   **Solving Grand Challenges:** There is hope that AI can be applied to tackle climate change and other "big challenges that face humanity" [[climate_change_in_historical_contexts | Climate change in historical contexts]].
*   **AI as a Research Assistant:** Once issues such as factuality and grounding are improved, AI could become "the worldâ€™s best research assistant" for scientists and clinicians.
*   **Advancing Medicine:** A key goal is to advance fields like medicine responsibly using AI.

## Limitations of Current AI in Science

Despite the successes, current AI systems have limitations in the scientific domain:

*   **Hypothesis Generation:** AI systems are "not at the level where they can create the hypothesis themselves or ask the right question". Asking the right question and formulating the problem correctly is considered the hardest part of science and is not something current systems can do [[limitations_of_large_language_models_llms_in_solving_novel_tasks | Limitations of large language models (LLMs) in solving novel tasks]].
*   **Reliability:** AI systems are "not reliable yet enough to do things like science with them" independently, requiring improvements in factuality and grounding [[challenges_in_ai_alignment_and_potential_risks | Challenges in AI alignment and potential risks]].

## Motivation for Domain-Specific Solutions (Pre-AGI)

Developing AI for specific scientific applications is pursued vigorously even before the advent of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) for several reasons:

*   **Timeliness and Immediate Benefit:** The timeline for AGI is uncertain [[timeline_predictions_for_agi_development | Timeline predictions for AGI development]]. Applying AI now can bring "incredible benefits to the world", allowing society to benefit many years before AGI might arrive.
*   **"Battle-Testing" AI Ideas:** Applying AI to real-world scientific problems "battle tests" the underlying ideas [[ai_developments_in_hardware_and_software_advancements | AI developments in hardware and software advancements]].
    *   It prevents research from deviating from real-world applicability and impact.
    *   It provides direct feedback on practical requirements like data efficiency, sample efficiency, and scalability.
    *   This process "keeps you honest" and helps steer research directions correctly to ensure they remain on the right path.
*   **Impact via Products:** As part of Google, DeepMind has the opportunity to ship advances into products used by billions, enhancing daily lives.

## Openness and Collaboration

DeepMind has a history of contributing to open science, having published thousands of papers and open-sourced tools like AlphaFold and GraphCast. The broader goal is to advance science and medicine in a bold yet responsible manner, ensuring these powerful tools benefit everyone and are used for the good of society [[philanthropy_and_global_impact_strategies | Philanthropy and global impact strategies]].

This article explores concepts related to economic growth, technological acceleration, and their potential future trajectories, as discussed by Holden Karnofsky, co-CEO of Open Philanthropy. The information is drawn from a podcast episode where Karnofsky elaborates on his "Most Important Century" thesis and related ideas.

## Historical Economic Growth and Acceleration

Historically, the rate at which the world economy has grown has seen an acceleration, with growth being significantly faster today than in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### The Feedback Loop Theory
One way to understand this acceleration is through a basic economic growth theory involving a feedback loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>:
1.  People come up with ideas.
2.  Ideas lead to greater productivity and more resources.
3.  More resources historically led to more people.
4.  More people then have more ideas, restarting the loop.

This "people, ideas, resources" cycle, when run over centuries, is theorized by standard economic models to produce accelerating growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Projecting this historical economic trajectory forward in the simplest way suggests the economy could reach an infinite growth rate within the current century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## The Broken Feedback Loop and AI's Potential Role

Karnofsky notes that a key step in this historical feedback loop broke a couple of hundred years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. While more ideas still lead to more resources, people generally stopped having more children when they had more resources; instead, they became richer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This means the "more resources" step no longer reliably leads to "more people" to generate more ideas, thus breaking the accelerating feedback loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, if developed to the point where they can perform the tasks humans do to advance science and technology (the "more ideas" part), could potentially restore this feedback loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This could lead to unbounded, heavily accelerating, and explosive growth in science and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Automating the creation of new technologies could mean every computer becomes a potential mind working on advancing technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

If such AI systems emerge this century, it could lead to explosive progress, packing thousands of years of change into a much shorter period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. This could result in reaching the limits of science and technology, leading to a civilization that expands beyond Earth and is very stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

## The "Weirdness" of Current Growth Rates

Even without considering transformative AI, the current era is described as extraordinarily "weird" based on commonly accepted facts about economic growth and technological development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
*   The last couple of hundred years have seen faster economic growth than any other period in human history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.
*   Significant scientific and technological developments are heavily concentrated in the recent past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

Karnofsky argues that current economic growth rates (around 2% in developed countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>) seem too high to be sustained for cosmologically significant periods, like another 10,000 years. Extrapolating this growth suggests we would require resources equivalent to multiple times the current world economy per atom in the galaxy, which is materially impossible if we cannot exceed the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>.

Even if the growth rate fell to 0.5%, Karnofsky suggests it would still likely hit limits within a cosmologically short timeframe (e.g., 25,000 years was a figure discussed, though its accuracy for the galaxy-limit calculation was questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>). Such a scenario would still mark the current period of 2% growth as a uniquely dynamic and fast-changing time in human history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>. If growth slowed even further, to say 0.01%, the contrast with the current 2% growth period would be even starker, making this era appear very special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>.

The argument about current growth rates is one piece of evidence suggesting we live in an unusual time, which makes the prospect of transformative AI this century less "crazy" than it might otherwise sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>. The accelerating trend of growth throughout history, even from low levels around 0 AD, points to a general pattern that might imply further acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>.

## The Industrial Revolution as a Precedent

The Industrial Revolution is cited as an example of an enormous deal in terms of changing the world and accelerating growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. Karnofsky posits that if one had foreseen it, focusing on its implications might have been the "right thing to be thinking about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. This historical transformation underscores the importance of looking for the "next big thing" given the current weirdness of accelerating growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

## Innovation and Its Limits

### Innovation as Mining
Karnofsky references his "innovation as mining" metaphor, which suggests that ideas are somewhat like natural resources: once discovered (like a scientific hypothesis or a great symphony), that specific innovation cannot be "done" again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:15">[00:54:15]</a>. This implies it might get harder over time to find revolutionary ideas because the easiest ones are found first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>. However, he doesn't see this as a major impediment to the AI-driven acceleration scenario, as the core idea is about automating the process of discovery itself [[open_source_ai_models_and_their_implications | open source AI models and their implications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.

### Potential Bottlenecks to Acceleration
A significant skepticism for the "Most Important Century" thesis is the possibility that even with highly capable AI, some steps in the innovation sequence might remain non-automatable by humans or real-world constraints [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_deploying_ai_at_scale | challenges and opportunities in deploying AI at scale]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:34">[00:55:34]</a>. For instance, real-world experiments might take a fixed amount of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:53">[00:55:53]</a>.

However, Karnofsky argues that one doesn't need to automate the *entire* economy to get the explosive growth loop. Automating key R&D sectors like energy technology and AI research itself might be sufficient [[ai_scalability_and_breakthroughs | AI scalability and breakthroughs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>. These areas, he suggests, seem less prone to physical bottlenecks than other parts of the economy. For example, AIs could design better AI algorithms and chips, which robots could manufacture, leading to even better designs, fueled by AI-designed efficient solar panels [[metas_advancements_in_ai_technology_and_infrastructure | Meta's advancements in AI technology and infrastructure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:44">[00:56:44]</a>. With enough analytical power, many experiments might be simulated, bypassing physical bottlenecks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:29">[00:57:29]</a>.

### Hardest vs. Easiest Automation
Counterintuitively, Karnofsky suggests that tasks like energy and AI innovation might not be the hardest to automate with advanced AI [[impact_of_ai_on_software_development_and_productivity | impact of AI on software development and productivity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>. Some of the hardest things to automate might be those requiring physical dexterity (like robotics, where progress is slower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:04">[00:59:04]</a>) or specific human presence/trust (e.g., care work, teaching, business deals where people prefer humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:02">[00:58:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a>). Progress in AI has been more on the software/cognitive front [[human_intelligence_vs_neural_network_intelligence | human intelligence vs neural network intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a>. Thus, an AI might take a scientist's job (discovering theories in a lab) before it fully replaces a teacher or doctor due to regulatory and social factors, even if its "brain" capabilities are equivalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:43">[00:59:43]</a>.

## Stagnation and the Future of Progress

There's a concern that economic and technological growth might slow down significantly or stagnate [[economic_impacts_of_ai_and_automation | economic impacts of AI and automation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:36">[01:07:36]</a>. Karnofsky acknowledges that the rapid change of the last few hundred years is historically anomalous and likely won't continue indefinitely at the same pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:55">[01:20:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:26">[01:21:26]</a>. There are observations suggesting some current slowdowns in innovation that might continue by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>.

The "Progress Studies" perspective often emphasizes increasing progress in science, technology, and economic growth [[impact_of_ai_on_economic_and_societal_structures | impact of AI on economic and societal structures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:04">[01:18:04]</a>. While sympathetic to the benefits of the last 200 years of growth, Karnofsky cautions that technological development isn't always positive (citing the agricultural revolution as a potential example of making things worse for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:05">[01:19:05]</a>). Humanity might be reaching a point where its technological power could be catastrophically dangerous (e.g., bioweapons, AI), suggesting a need for more caution rather than just accelerating all progress indiscriminately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:24">[01:19:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>.

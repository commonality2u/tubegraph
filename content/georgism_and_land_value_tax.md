Georgism is an economic philosophy developed by the 19th-century American economist Henry George, primarily known from his work "Progress and Poverty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>. The central thesis, as summarized by Lars Doucet in his book "Land is a Big Deal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>, is that land plays a significantly underrated yet crucial role in the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:53">[01:01:53]</a>. Georgism proposes solutions to the paradox of "progress and poverty"—why poverty persists and even advances despite technological and societal progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:45">[02:02:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:52">[02:02:52]</a>.

Lars Doucet, a game developer known for "Defender's Quest," authored "Land is a Big Deal," an expansion of his award-winning review of "Progress and Poverty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. His interest in Georgism was partly sparked by observing "virtual housing crises" in online multiplayer games [[game_development_and_virtual_land_speculation]], where digital land speculation mirrored real-world problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:02">[06:06:02]</a>.

## Core Tenets

### Land as a Unique Asset
Georgism emphasizes that land is a unique factor of production because it is not created by human effort; "nobody made the earth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:07">[09:09:07]</a>. Its value is derived from natural attributes and, more significantly, from the presence and activities of the surrounding community (location, location, location) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:44">[01:01:44]</a>. Control over land has been a fundamental struggle throughout human and even pre-human history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:05">[02:02:05]</a>.

### The Problem of Rent-Seeking
Georgism argues that private ownership of land allows landowners to capture "economic rent"—the unearned increment of value that accrues to land due to societal progress and public investment, without the landowner necessarily contributing to that value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:03">[04:04:03]</a>. This is seen as a form of "rent-seeking," where individuals or entities gatekeep access to a necessary resource that they did not create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:03">[04:04:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:19">[09:09:19]</a>.

### Addressing the "Progress and Poverty" Paradox
George observed that as societies progress and wealth increases, poverty often deepens. Georgism posits that this is because the benefits of progress are largely absorbed by rising land values and rents, enriching landowners at the expense of labor and capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:52">[02:02:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:07">[03:03:07]</a>. The philosophy suggests that by capturing this socially created value, the paradox can be resolved.

## Land Value Tax (LVT)

The primary policy prescription of Georgism is the **Land Value Tax (LVT)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:25">[01:01:25]</a>.

*   **Definition**: LVT is a tax levied on the unimproved value of land. It specifically excludes the value of buildings, infrastructure, or any other improvements made by humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a>.
*   **Distinction from Property Tax**: Unlike typical property taxes, which tax both the land and the improvements on it, LVT only targets the land component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>. This means building a new structure or improving an existing one would not increase one's tax burden under an LVT system.
*   **Economic Efficiency**: Georgists argue LVT is highly efficient. It aims to tax unproductive rent-seeking and non-produced assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:30">[09:09:30]</a>, rather than productive activities like labor or capital investment. The aphorism "if you want less of something, you should tax it" implies current taxes on income and capital discourage desirable activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:43">[09:09:43]</a>.

## Arguments for LVT / Georgism

*   **Pro-Worker and Pro-Business**: Georgism claims to be genuinely pro-worker and pro-business by being against land speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:28">[02:02:28]</a>. It seeks to remove burdens from productive labor and capital.
*   **Discouraging Land Speculation**: LVT would make it costly to hold land vacant or underutilized, especially in high-demand areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:33">[16:16:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:50">[16:16:50]</a>. This encourages landowners to develop their land to its most productive use or sell it to someone who will.
*   **Funding Public Services / Replacing Other Taxes**: Revenue from LVT could be used to fund public services or replace less efficient and more distortionary taxes like income, sales, or capital gains taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:11">[10:10:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:26">[10:10:26]</a>. Doucet estimates that a 100% LVT in the US could raise around $4 trillion annually, potentially funding Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid, or defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:00:05">[49:00:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:04:00">[49:04:00]</a>. The revenue could also fund a Universal Basic Income (UBI) or "Citizen's Dividend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:00:54">[49:00:54]</a>.
*   **Simplicity and Transparency**: Compared to income tax, which Doucet describes as requiring a "full anal probe on everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:00:52">[54:00:52]</a>, LVT is simpler. The tax is on the land itself; one simply needs to ensure "the check shows up in the mail" for a given address, regardless of complex ownership structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:00:41">[54:00:41]</a>.
*   **Severance Tax**: A related concept is the severance tax on the extraction of natural resources, like Norway's successful model with its oil industry, which has helped it avoid the "resource curse" [[the_history_and_evolution_of_the_oil_industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:59">[12:12:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:03">[13:13:03]</a>.

## Addressing Criticisms and Questions

### Incentives for Land Use
*   **Why aren't landowners already maximizing use?** Land speculators may optimize for the rate of return on land appreciation, not necessarily immediate development income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:38">[14:14:38]</a>. Existing property taxes can incentivize leaving lots empty to avoid higher tax burdens on improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:11">[16:16:11]</a>. "Land banking" (holding land while waiting for prices to rise) is common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:33">[16:16:33]</a>.

### Scarcity Mindset vs. Abundance
*   Doucet argues the current system embodies a scarcity mindset, while Georgism promotes an abundance mindset by efficiently sharing the earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:49">[18:18:49]</a>. The "urban agglomeration effect" (value from proximity to human networks) is key, making specific locations non-fungible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:19:22">[19:19:22]</a>. America's history involved frontier expansions (Westward, then automobile-driven suburbanization) which temporarily masked underlying land issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:19:05">[19:19:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:54">[20:00:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00:52">[21:00:52]</a>. These frontiers eventually "close" as their benefits get priced into land values.

### Comparison to Taxing Unimproved Labor/Capital
*   The argument for taxing land differently stems from justice: the Earth pre-exists human labor and was not made by any individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:08">[08:08:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:07">[09:09:07]</a>. The focus is on taxing non-produced assets and monopolies first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>. Taxing the "opportunity cost" of labor is deemed too subjective and bureaucratic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:03">[11:11:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:22">[11:11:22]</a>.

### The "Search Theoretic" Critique (Kaplan & Gauthier)
*   This critique suggests that identifying valuable land is itself a productive activity deserving reward. Doucet notes Gauthier may have revised his views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:00:33">[25:00:33]</a>. Kaplan's argument mainly applies to a 100% LVT, while most Georgists advocate for a slightly lower rate (e.g., 85%) to leave some incentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:00:56">[25:00:56]</a>. Norway's oil model, which subsidizes discovery costs but heavily taxes extraction via a severance tax, serves as a counter-example, showing discovery can be incentivized differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:00:02">[27:00:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:00:09">[27:00:09]</a>.

### Impact on the Banking Sector
*   A sudden, full implementation of LVT could shock the banking sector due to crashing property selling prices, as many loans are backed by real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:00:06">[33:00:06]</a>. However, Doucet argues any transition would be incremental, allowing time for adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:00:44">[33:00:44]</a>.

### Competition Among Landowners (Ricardo's Law of Rent)
*   **Ricardo's Law of Rent** explains that rent is determined by the difference in productivity between a given piece of land and the least productive land in use (the "margin of production") or the best free alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:00:04">[35:00:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:00:45">[37:00:45]</a>. Tenants compete, bidding up rents. In high-productivity cities like San Francisco, it takes time for land values to fully absorb productivity gains. High-income workers can afford to live there because their earnings exceed the average productivity captured in rent, while lower-income individuals are pushed to more marginal areas [[the_impact_and_philosophy_of_san_francisco_on_innovation_and_entrepreneurship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:00:03">[39:00:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:00:16">[39:00:16]</a>.

### Source of Wealth (Are the richest landowners?)
*   While some prominent billionaires are tech founders, Doucet points out that many billionaires are involved in finance (hedge funds, banking), and a large portion of bank lending (two-thirds) is tied to real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:00:51">[40:00:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:01:01">[41:01:01]</a>. Much wealth is extracted by a "hidden landed gentry" of upper-middle and upper-class individuals owning residential land, particularly from younger and productive populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:00:57">[42:00:57]</a>.

### Regressivity Concerns
*   LVT is sometimes perceived as regressive. However, Doucet argues that the majority of land value is concentrated in commercial real estate in central business districts, not primarily in residential areas owned by lower or middle-income individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:00:25">[44:00:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:00:41">[44:00:41]</a>. Furthermore, current property tax assessment inaccuracies (under-assessing valuable properties, over-assessing less valuable ones and those owned by minorities/poor) contribute to perceived regressivity, an issue improved assessment could fix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:00:50">[45:00:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>.

### Practical Implementation: Assessing Land Value
*   A key challenge is accurately separating land value from improvement value. Lars Doucet's startup, **GeoLand Solutions** (working name) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:38">[01:02:38]</a>, aims to improve mass appraisal techniques using modern methods like multiple regression, moving beyond outdated cost-approach methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.
*   Transparency is crucial, potentially through open-source models and publicly accessible data, allowing citizens to verify assessments [[open_source_ai_models_and_their_implications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:45">[01:06:45]</a>.
*   Land selling value is derived from its rental value (Net Present Value of future income flow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>. A 100% LVT would theoretically reduce the selling price of land to zero, but its productive (rental) value remains, with the rent flowing to the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>. If vacant lots still have a selling price, it indicates not all rent is being captured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:26">[01:01:26]</a>.

### Transition and Political Feasibility
*   **Gordon Tullock's "transitional gains trap"** acknowledges that people who bought assets (like land or taxi medallions) at high, speculation-inflated prices in good faith could be unfairly harmed by reforms that devalue those assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:00:13">[57:00:13]</a>.
*   A gradual transition is proposed, perhaps starting with a **revenue-neutral split-rate property tax**, where the tax rate on buildings is set to zero, and the LVT rate is adjusted to collect the same total revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:00:31">[51:00:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:00:04">[52:00:04]</a>. This could be combined with a citizen's dividend to ensure fairness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:00:31">[58:00:31]</a>.
*   Politically, LVT could be more feasible if pitched as property tax reform, exempting buildings from taxation [[political_feasibility_of_land_value_tax]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:11">[01:25:11]</a>. There are current discussions in cities like Detroit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:54">[01:27:54]</a>.
*   In Texas, a constitutional provision requiring uniform property taxation (interpreted as same rate for land and buildings) poses a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:18">[01:26:18]</a>, though interpretations vary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:44">[01:26:44]</a>.

## Broader Applications and Interpretations

Georgist principles can be applied beyond physical land:

### Digital "Land" and Land-like Assets
A "land-like asset" is defined as scarce, necessary for production, and obtaining locational value within a network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:23">[01:16:23]</a>.
*   **Domain Names**: Vitalik Buterin has written about applying Georgist theory to domain names like the Ethereum Name System (ENS), considering issues of identity linked to names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a>.
*   **App Stores**: Platforms like Apple's App Store charging a 30% "tithe" exhibit rent-seeking characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:49">[01:15:49]</a>.
*   **Social Media Attention & Chart Positions**: High-ranking positions on platforms (e.g., search results, app store charts) can be seen as a form of virtual land, with advertising spend acting as a kind of rent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:44">[01:18:44]</a>.
*   **Crypto Forcing LVT**: It's speculated that if cryptocurrencies make income and capital gains difficult to tax, governments might be forced to rely on LVT as the only remaining legible tax base [[crypto_skepticism_and_the_impact_of_cryptocurrency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:00:19">[55:00:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:00:47">[55:00:47]</a>. Many crypto proponents, including Vitalik Buterin (who endorsed Doucet's book), are interested in Georgism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>.

### Copyright and Patents
The application here is less developed, but Georgism critiques the enclosure of natural monopolies and rent-seeking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:14">[01:23:14]</a>. Excessively long copyright and patent terms could be seen as such, hindering innovation by preventing creative reuse (e.g., Disney benefiting from public domain works then advocating for longer copyright) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22">[01:19:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:33">[01:23:33]</a>. Patent trolling, like the "Carmack's Reverse" algorithm issue, also exemplifies this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:43">[01:19:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:58">[01:19:58]</a>. A Georgist approach might suggest shorter terms.

### Space Colonization (Interstellar Georgism)
The Outer Space Treaty currently embodies Georgist-like principles by stating celestial bodies cannot be claimed by nations, treating them like international waters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:12">[01:21:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:17">[01:21:17]</a>. As space colonization becomes feasible, applying Georgist principles could prevent first-comers from monopolizing resources and charging excessive rents to later arrivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51">[01:20:51]</a>.

### The Disney World Question
If an entity like Disney World owns so much land that it essentially creates its own local amenities and value, are they entitled to all the proceeds? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:38">[01:30:38]</a>. In this scenario, Disney World effectively becomes the "government" or "community" for that area, internalizing the positive externalities of its own development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:03">[01:31:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>. The question then shifts to one of governance of this "private city" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:12">[01:32:12]</a>. The core Georgist idea that rents *will* be collected one way or another still applies; the question is whether they are collected for private benefit or on behalf of the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a>.

## Lars Doucet's Work

Lars Doucet is actively working to advance practical Georgism. His startup, **GeoLand Solutions** (working title) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:19">[01:35:19]</a>, recently closed a funding round led by Sam Altman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:03">[01:37:03]</a>. The company aims to partner with municipalities to improve mass appraisal of property, making assessments more accurate, efficient, up-to-date, and transparent, often leveraging open-source and open-data solutions [[open_source_ai_models_and_their_implications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:34">[01:35:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:50">[01:35:50]</a>. Doucet believes that accurately measuring land value is a crucial step toward both advocating for and implementing Georgist policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:33">[01:36:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:12">[01:37:12]</a>.

He continues his work in game development, with "Defender's Quest 2" slated for release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:10">[01:35:10]</a>.

Patrick Collison, CEO of Stripe, shared his evolving perspective on the cultural impact of San Francisco on career development, particularly for individuals in their 20s. This discussion stems from his earlier advice for people aged 10 to 20, where he had recommended going to San Francisco [[advice_for_young_professionals_and_career_paths | [00:00:54]]], [[impact_of_robert_moses_on_new_york_citys_infrastructure | [00:01:13]]].

## The Prevailing San Francisco Ethos

Collison identifies a distinct cultural orientation in San Francisco, often using the city as a "metonym for a cultural orientation" [[impact_of_culture_and_environment_on_intelligence | [00:02:49]]].

### Valorization of Iconoclasm and Founding Archetypes
San Francisco's culture highly "valorizes striking out on your own, iconoclastically dismissing the received wisdom" [[artificial_intelligence_vs_human_intelligence | [00:02:11]]]. It particularly "praises the founding archetypes and lore of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates and all the rest" [[historical_influences_on_leadership_and_innovation | [00:02:17]]]. Collison acknowledges that his own company, Stripe, to some extent, fits this pattern [[potential_risks_and_benefits_of_ai_alignment | [00:02:33]]]. While he sees value in this phenomenon, he also notes that "the world needs lots of other things" [[open_source_ai_models_and_their_implications | [00:02:39]]].

### Emphasis on Entrepreneurship
There is a "strange emphasis placed on entrepreneurship in San Francisco" [[philosophical_perspectives_on_consciousness_and_free_will | [00:07:03]]]. Collison believes that entrepreneurs are "held in excessively high regard" in the city [[meritocracy_and_the_role_of_billionaires_in_entrepreneurship | [00:06:40]]]. While he appreciates entrepreneurs as a group, he cautions that this focus "should not be people's only fixation" [[potential_ai_takeover_scenarios_and_implications | [00:07:07]]].

## Limitations and Alternative Paths

Collison now wonders if people in their 20s "shouldn't go to San Francisco," [[environmental_impact_and_sustainability_in_the_anthropocene | [00:01:24]]], or at least, that it's not a universal recommendation, despite a "significant set of people who should go" [[advice_for_young_professionals_and_career_paths | [00:01:31]]].

### Discouragement of Deep Technical Expertise
A key concern is that San Francisco's cultural orientation "doesn't encourage the pursuit of really deep technical knowledge" [[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | [00:02:55]]]. This is problematic because many career paths that are valuable for the world and fulfilling for individuals "require accumulating a lot of expertise and studying a domain in tremendous depth" [[advice_for_young_professionals_and_career_paths | [00:01:40]]] - [[the_role_of_cultural_and_technological_innovations_in_human_evolution | [00:02:02]]].

### The Case for Deep Specialization
Collison provides examples of individuals whose significant contributions required long-term dedication to acquiring specialized knowledge:
*   **Herb Boyer**: Co-founder of Genentech, who helped produce cheap insulin for the first time with recombinant DNA [[economic_growth_and_technological_acceleration | [00:03:18]]] - [[historical_and_modern_perspectives_on_urban_development_and_public_works | [00:03:27]]]. Collison notes, "Herb Boyer couldn't have done that at age 23. Herb Boyer first had to accumulate all of the knowledge and the skills required... over the course of a multi-decade career." [[historical_influences_on_leadership_and_innovation | [00:03:35]]] - [[philosophical_perspectives_on_consciousness_and_free_will | [00:03:47]]]. He feels San Francisco "doesn't culturally encourage one to become Herb Boyer" [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_deploying_ai_at_scale | [00:03:52]]].
*   **Patrick Hsu**: Co-founder of Arc, who announced a new phenomenon of "bridge editing," a new recombinase technology [[impact_of_ai_and_quantum_computing_on_industries_like_gaming_and_healthcare | [00:04:02]]] - [[historical_influences_on_leadership_and_innovation | [00:04:22]]]. Collison states, "In order to do something like that, you have to study for a long time and acquire a lot of technical skills" [[the_impact_of_design_and_technology_in_education | [00:04:31]]] - [[ai_alignment_and_potential_risks | [00:04:38]]].

## Status Orientation
Collison also observes that "San Francisco is very status oriented" [[economic_and_political_structures_in_historical_contexts | [00:06:25]]], though he qualifies this by adding that "everything is status oriented" [[economic_inequality_and_rent_seeking | [00:06:32]]]. This status orientation seems to contribute to the high regard in which entrepreneurs are held.

In summary, while San Francisco fosters a dynamic environment for iconoclastic entrepreneurship, Collison suggests that its cultural values may not be as conducive for individuals pursuing paths that require deep, long-term accumulation of specialized technical expertise.

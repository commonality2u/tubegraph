Virtual Reality (VR) involves wearing a headset to become completely immersed in a new virtual world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Augmented Reality (AR), on the other hand, overlays virtual elements onto the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Both VR and AR are considered difficult to effectively demonstrate, requiring users to experience them firsthand to fully understand and appreciate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. There is ongoing curiosity about VR, with questions about whether it's merely a fleeting tech trend, like 3D TVs, or a glimpse into a future resembling "Ready Player One" or "Wall-E" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## [[meta_and_the_metaverse | Meta's]] Vision for VR and AR

[[meta_and_the_metaverse | Meta]], formerly known as Facebook, is a prominent company heavily investing in VR and AR, viewing them as the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. [[meta_and_the_metaverse | Meta's]] CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has reaffirmed his commitment to the metaverse, with the company pouring substantial funds into its development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This commitment comes as [[meta_and_the_metaverse | Meta's]] stock has fallen over 60% and Facebook's growth has stagnated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The strategy is to control the next major technological shift, focusing on VR and AR to manage software, hardware, and advertising within this future ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## The [[comparison_with_other_vr_headsets | Meta Quest Pro]]

The [[comparison_with_other_vr_headsets | Meta Quest Pro]] headset, priced at $1,500, is lauded for its advanced technology and comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Its design distributes components, placing displays and lenses at the front, speakers and buttons in the middle, and the battery at the back, improving balance and perceived lightness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

Key specifications include:
*   **Processor**: Custom Snapdragon XR2+ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>
*   **Storage**: 256 GB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>
*   **RAM**: 12 GB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>
*   **Display Resolution**: 1920 x 1800 pixels per eye at up to 90 FPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>
*   **Sensors**: 10 external sensors and cameras for full-color pass-through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>
*   **Controllers**: New Touch Pro controllers with their own cameras and sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>
*   **Battery Life**: Approximately 1.5 hours unplugged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>

The headset also features internal sensors for [[user_experience_and_eye_tracking_with_apple_vision_pro | face and eye tracking]], allowing for real-time replication of user expressions and movements in virtual environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. While the headset is somewhat bulky and doesn't fold, limiting its travel portability, future iterations are envisioned to be significantly smaller, resembling regular glasses or lightweight devices like Google Glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## [[vision_pros_unique_applications_and_ecosystem | Unique Applications and Ecosystem]]

[[meta_and_the_metaverse | Meta's]] strategy is to replicate and enhance real-world internet activities within VR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

### [[game_compatibility_and_nextgen_gaming_experience | Gaming]]
VR currently offers good gaming experiences, with ongoing efforts to expand game variety, improve fidelity, and enhance immersion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Significant investment in the VR ecosystem is aimed at enticing developers to create more advanced games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### Virtual Meetings and Work
[[meta_and_the_metaverse | Meta]] has developed a virtual meeting room experience for video conferencing in VR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. This includes features like:
*   Breakout rooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>
*   Immersive presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>
*   [[personalized_spatial_audio_and_ear_scan | Relative audio positioning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>
*   Ability to lean over and speak quietly to nearby participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>

Current avatars are customizable but described as "cringey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. However, [[meta_and_the_metaverse | Meta]] has demonstrated a live avatar feature allowing users to scan themselves with a phone to create a photorealistic virtual version of themselves, complete with [[user_experience_and_eye_tracking_with_apple_vision_pro | face and eye tracking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

For remote work, [[meta_and_the_metaverse | Meta]] is building a "Virtual Office Building" where people can collaborate in shared spaces globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. The [[comparison_with_other_vr_headsets | Meta Quest Pro]] offers native Mac support, allowing users to project their Mac screen onto multiple, large virtual displays, effectively providing a portable triple-monitor setup with high resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. [[meta_and_the_metaverse | Meta]] has also partnered with Microsoft to integrate Office 365 into virtual workrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, and with Accenture to provide thousands of headsets for virtual work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

## [[developments_and_future_expectations_for_vr_and_ar | Developments and Future Expectations]]

The younger generation is more likely to engage with VR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. [[meta_and_the_metaverse | Meta]] leadership firmly believes VR is the future, a stance necessary given the company's full commitment to this direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. The company aims to make VR applications so good that they surpass their real-life counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

There are concerns about one company, [[meta_and_the_metaverse | Meta]], controlling the foundation of this "second-generation internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. [[meta_and_the_metaverse | Meta]] seeks to build the next foundational platform, controlling all experiences that grow on it, including workrooms and games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. This ambition stems from Facebook's previous reliance on existing foundations, which they now want to avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

Despite [[meta_and_the_metaverse | Meta's]] aggressive investments, other companies like Pico and Google are also developing VR technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. Apple is also expected to unveil its own VR headset, which could introduce significant competition for [[meta_and_the_metaverse | Meta]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. While [[meta_and_the_metaverse | Meta]] has already built numerous connections and acquired many VR companies and studios, positioning them to potentially bring VR technology to the mainstream, the concern remains about a single company having too much control over the future of the internet, especially regarding data usage like [[user_experience_and_eye_tracking_with_apple_vision_pro | eye tracking]] for advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. Competition is seen as crucial for driving innovation and producing better products for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

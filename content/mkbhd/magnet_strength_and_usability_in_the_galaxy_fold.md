The [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Samsung Galaxy Fold]] incorporates strong magnets that contribute to its unique folding mechanism and user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Magnet Placement and Strength
There is a magnet located on each side of the [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Galaxy Fold]], positioned approximately two-thirds of the way down the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. These magnets are notably strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## Magnetic Field and Object Interaction
The magnets in the [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Galaxy Fold]] create a significant magnetic field that extends effectively outside the phone itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. This strength allows the device to pick up various metal objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

Examples of objects the [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Galaxy Fold]]'s magnets can attract:
*   A bunch of washers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>
*   Nails, including whole bags of nails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>
*   Keychains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>
*   A small wrench <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>
*   An Apple Pencil (due to its internal metal components) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>
*   A very large Allen key made of metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>

The presence and strength of these magnets were demonstrated using magnet paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## User Experience
The strong magnets contribute to a "super satisfying" feel when closing the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. The secure closure provided by the magnets supports the appeal of foldable, "flip phone" designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

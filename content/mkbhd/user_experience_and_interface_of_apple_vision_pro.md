The [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | Apple Vision Pro]] is described as one of Apple's most radical products, offering an experience that is both "absolutely incredible" and "borderline unfinished" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. Having been used for about a week, the experience of wearing and interacting with the device reveals many new technologies, including a new operating system, infrared [[user_experience_and_eye_tracking_with_apple_vision_pro | eye tracking]], and virtual reconstructions of the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

## Hardware Design Influencing User Experience
The [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | Vision Pro]] is constructed from metal and glass, making it a high-quality but relatively heavy device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. It features a Digital Crown that can be pressed or turned, and a single larger button, similar to an Apple Watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. Downward-facing speakers pointed at the ears work "surprisingly well," though some audio can be heard by others nearby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

The headset, weighing 638 grams with the solo knit band, is front-weighted due to the external battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. This external battery, with a "surprisingly small" 3,366 mAh capacity, connects via a non-removable four-foot cable with a proprietary twist-and-lock connector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. The device powers on when connected, displaying an Apple logo on the outside screen during its less-than-a-minute boot time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. There is no dedicated on/off button; to turn it off, the cable must be unplugged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. Battery life is typically two to four hours, which is comparable to other VR headsets, but can be extended by plugging the battery into a power source via its USB-C port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.

## Core Interaction and Control
The [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | Vision Pro]] operates without physical controllers, relying primarily on eye and hand input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>. It also supports external input methods like game controllers, mice, and keyboards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.

### Initial Setup and Calibration
Upon first use, the headset undergoes a calibration process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>:
1.  **Lens Adjustment**: The lenses physically move to match the distance between the user's eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.
2.  **Hand Scan**: A scan is performed to help the headset understand the user's hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.
3.  **Eye Tracking Calibration**: The user looks at various dots on the screen and taps their fingers together to select them, akin to an eye test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.

### Eye and Hand Input
The primary input methods are **eye tracking** and **hand gestures** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>:
*   **Eye Tracking**: Users select items by simply looking at them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>. A significant adjustment for users is the need to look "exactly what you're looking at" to control it, unlike traditional UIs where control can extend beyond the direct gaze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.
*   **Hand Gestures**: Pinching fingers together acts as a "select" action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>. Thanks to wide-angle sensors, users can rest their hands anywhere—in front or in their lap—as long as the pinch gesture is visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>. Pinching and grabbing in the air allows for scrolling, behaving as if pulling a string <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.

### VisionOS Interface
VisionOS is described as "kind of similar to iPadOS, but way more glassy, and of course with the extra dimension of 3D space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.
*   **App Drawer**: A single press of the Digital Crown brings up the app drawer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>.
*   **Spatial Positioning Lock**: A highly impressive feature is the "incredible spatial positioning lock," where virtual windows and objects appear "locked in place in 3D space" within the room, maintaining their position regardless of head or body movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.
*   **Window Interaction**: VisionOS app windows are "glassy" with frosted glass around the UI, allowing some transparency to the real world and casting shadows to solidify their presence in the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. A bar at the bottom of each window allows users to drag it forward, backward, or anywhere in 3D space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>. Corners allow for resizing, and an 'X' closes the window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.
*   **Control Center**: Accessed by physically turning the head upwards and selecting an arrow that appears, providing quick access to battery life, notifications, focus modes, and screen recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>.
*   **Text Input**: Three main methods for text input:
    1.  **Hunt and Peck**: Physically "poking" virtual keys on an in-air keyboard, which only reacts to pointer fingers, making fast typing difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>.
    2.  **Gaze and Pinch**: Looking at a desired key and pinching to select it. This method can be surprisingly fast for users familiar with a keyboard layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>.
    3.  **Voice Input**: In Safari, users can speak a URL into the microphone for quick navigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>.

## Passthrough and Immersive Environments
By default, [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | passthrough]] mode is active, allowing users to see their surroundings through the device's cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>. This is presented as "augmented reality," although it's technically a reconstructed camera feed, not true AR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>. The [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | Vision Pro]] offers the "best passthrough of any VR headset," characterized by high pixel density, 90Hz refresh rate, impressive dynamic range, and correctly adjusting shutter speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. Passthrough latency is under 12 milliseconds, the lowest in the industry, processed by the R1 chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>. This low latency allows for legitimate interaction with the physical world, such as catching items or even playing ping pong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>.

Limitations of passthrough include blurriness for very close-up objects and inability to read small text (like on a phone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>. Colors and brightness in passthrough are very close to reality, but the real world still appears brighter once the headset is removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>.

Users can fully immerse themselves by rotating the Digital Crown clockwise, which gradually dials in a virtual environment, replacing the real world view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>. Existing open windows remain locked in place within the chosen environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>. Built-in environments are "most realistic digital environments" seen to date, often featuring relaxing scenic locations like Mount Hood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>.

## Applications and Ecosystem
The [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | Vision Pro]] features two types of applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:00">[15:39:00]</a>:
1.  **Vision Pro Native Apps**: Specifically built to leverage the headset's capabilities, often with a "super glassy frosted window" design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>.
    *   **Apple Music, Notes, Settings**: Rebuilt with a new "material design," looking like glassy iPad apps in the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:00]</a>.
    *   **Media Apps (Apple TV, Disney+)**: Include entire environments for media consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:44:00">[16:44:00]</a>. Apple TV offers proprietary 180-degree videos for [[content_consumption_and_applications_on_apple_vision_pro | Vision Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52:00">[16:52:00]</a>.
    *   **Photos App**: Allows viewing panoramic photos in a fully immersive view with a parallax effect, making them feel like a window into the photo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a>.
    *   **Third-Party Apps**: Examples include Sky Guide for exploring constellations with interactive information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:00">[17:30:00]</a>, Jig Space for loading and manipulating 3D models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:47:00">[17:47:00]</a>, and Keynote for practicing presentations in virtual conference rooms or the Steve Jobs Theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:00]</a>.
2.  **Compatible iPhone/iPad Apps**: These are iOS/iPadOS apps that developers haven't opted out of, appearing largely as standard iPad apps with the same functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:04:00">[19:04:00]</a>.
    *   **Notable Absences**: Major apps like Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify have actively chosen not to be available at launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a>. Users can, however, access web versions through the Safari browser, which supports full-screen 4K video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:32:00">[20:32:00]</a>.

### Apple Ecosystem Integration
The "killer app" of the [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | Vision Pro]] is identified as its seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:52:00">[20:52:00]</a>. Upon logging in with an Apple ID, services like iMessages, Photos, and Notes are immediately accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00:00">[21:00:00]</a>.

### Mac Integration
A standout feature is the ability to connect to a Mac as a virtual display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:37:00">[21:37:00]</a>. By selecting "Become My Mac's Virtual Display," the Mac's screen blacks out and is transformed into a 4K window within the headset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:44:00">[21:44:00]</a>. The Mac's physical keyboard and trackpad continue to function, controlling the virtual display, which can be resized and repositioned as desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:02:00">[22:02:00]</a>. Users can also open and place other VisionOS apps around the Mac's virtual display, controlling them seamlessly with the same keyboard and trackpad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:19:00">[22:19:00]</a>. A current limitation is that only one virtual monitor from the Mac can be used at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:37:00">[23:37:00]</a>.

## Personas: Digital Representation of Self
A defining characteristic of the [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | Vision Pro]] is **Personas**, a beta feature involving virtual representations of the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:09:00">[00:24:09]</a>.
*   **Outward-Facing Eyes**: The headset displays a representation of the user's eyes on an outward-facing OLED screen, visible to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:48:00">[00:24:48]</a>. This is not a passthrough, but a reconstruction based on internal sensors tracking the user's eyes at 90 frames per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[00:24:50]</a>.
    *   **Indicating Presence**: When in passthrough mode, the eyes "shine through" to signal to external individuals that the wearer can see them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:32:00">[00:25:32]</a>.
    *   **Immersion Indicator**: During immersive experiences, the eyes are covered with a blue/purple glowing animation, indicating the wearer cannot see their surroundings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:43:00">[00:25:43]</a>.
    *   **Interacting with Others**: If a person outside the headset speaks while the user is immersed, that person can "appear through the fog" of the immersive environment, and the user's eyes will subtly show through the glow on the exterior display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:56:00">[00:25:56]</a>.
    *   **Display Technology**: The screen for the eyes is behind a lenticular film, creating a 3D depth effect that makes the eyes appear sunken into the display rather than flat on the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:42:00">[00:26:42]</a>.
    *   **Appearance**: The actual appearance of the eyes on the outside is often dim, especially for darker skin tones, and can look "weird" or have eyes that are "a little too far apart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:30:00">[00:30:30]</a>.
*   **Persona Creation**: To enable the outward-facing eyes and virtual camera feed, users register their Persona through a scanning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:26:00">[00:27:26]</a>. This involves taking off the headset and holding it at eye level while slowly turning and tilting the head, and performing facial expressions like smiling and raising eyebrows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:10:00">[00:28:10]</a>. This creates a "digital representation of your face" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:16:00">[00:29:16]</a>.
    *   **Uncanny Valley**: While impressive, Personas are noted to be "right at the edge of the uncanny valley," not quite human-like, with hair often appearing as a "frozen lump" instead of flowing realistically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:42:00">[00:31:42]</a>.
*   **FaceTime Integration**: The Persona serves as the camera feed for apps like FaceTime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:54:00">[00:31:54]</a>.
    *   **Virtual Windows**: FaceTime calls appear as "glassy windows floating in space" with participants looking through them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:36:00">[00:32:36]</a>.
    *   **Dynamic Eye Contact**: The angle at which a user looks into a window matches the angle seen by the other participant, meaning if a user looks at a specific person, others on the call see the side of their head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:46:00">[00:32:46]</a>.
    *   **Tracked Gestures**: Hand gestures made within the interaction bubble are tracked and appear at the correct angle towards the intended recipient, not broadcast to all participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:17:00">[00:33:17]</a>.
    *   **Spatial Audio**: Incredibly well-developed, with voices emanating from the direction of the corresponding Persona window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:43:00">[00:33:43]</a>. Moving a Persona window also shifts the perceived source of their audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:54:00">[00:33:54]</a>. Activating immersive environments changes the sound to simulate a "gigantic space with no echo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:08:00">[00:34:08]</a>.
    *   **Overall Impression**: FaceTime on [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | Vision Pro]] is described as the "most well thought out" and "most futuristic" experience, despite the Personas not being perfectly human-like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:25:00">[00:35:25]</a>.

## User Experience Summary
Overall, the [[user_experience_and_eye_tracking_with_apple_vision_pro | Vision Pro]] offers unparalleled experiences in immersion, spatial placement, [[user_experience_and_eye_tracking_with_apple_vision_pro | eye tracking]] and hand control, [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | passthrough]], [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | ecosystem]] integration, and spatial audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:38:00">[00:36:38]</a>. However, it faces challenges with its weight and comfort, the appearance of the outward-facing eyes, limited [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | app selection]], [[technical_limitations_and_drawbacks_of_apple_vision_pro | battery life]], and [[pricing_and_potential_market_for_apple_vision_pro | price]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:51:00">[00:36:51]</a>.

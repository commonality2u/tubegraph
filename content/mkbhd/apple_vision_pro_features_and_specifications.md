Zeiss lenses are available for users who wear glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Sensors and Tracking

The [[apple_vision_pro_hardware_and_design | Apple Vision Pro]] is equipped with numerous sensors for environmental and user tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>:
*   Two main forward-facing cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
*   Two downward-facing cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>
*   Two side cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>
*   Two infrared illuminators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>
*   A LiDAR scanner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>
*   A TrueDepth camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>
These external sensors track the surrounding environment and the user's hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

Inside the headset, infrared illuminators and cameras are solely dedicated to tracking the user's eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This [[user_experience_and_eye_tracking_with_apple_vision_pro | eye tracking]] is described as exceptionally impressive and "like magic," allowing for immediate UI highlighting and selection based on gaze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. A calibration process, where the user looks at various dots, helps the headset learn their eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### User Interaction and Interface

The [[user_experience_and_interface_of_apple_vision_pro | user experience and interface of Apple Vision Pro]] is designed to be controller-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Eye Tracking**: Users look at an item to highlight it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Hand Gestures**: To select an item, users simply touch their fingers together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. The external sensors accurately pick up hand movements regardless of their position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This allows for scrolling, resizing windows, and dragging objects by touching fingers together and moving them in the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   **Voice Input**: For text entry, users can look at a search box or text field and start talking, with the headset filling in the words via its microphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   **Optic ID**: The headset uses [[user_experience_and_eye_tracking_with_apple_vision_pro | Optic ID]], a biometric security feature that scans the unique pattern of a user's eyes for login <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Digital Crown**: A digital crown on the side allows users to adjust immersion levels, spinning it clockwise to increase VR environment envelopment or counter-clockwise to bring in more of the real world via pass-through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

### Pass-through and External Display

The [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | Apple Vision Pro]] features a unique "2-way pass-through" system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>:
*   **Pass-through Mode**: Unlike typical opaque VR headsets, the [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | Apple Vision Pro]] has an external OLED screen facing outwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. The pass-through mode, which uses external cameras, is stereo, color, sharp, and real-time, making it the best seen in a headset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **External Eye Display**: When the user is in pass-through mode (seeing their environment), the external OLED display shows a representation of their eyes, making it appear as if others can see them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. If the user is fully immersed in a VR environment, like watching a movie or playing a game, the external screen displays a graphic instead of their eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

### Operating System and [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | Applications and Ecosystem]]

The [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | Apple Vision Pro]] runs on a new operating system called VisionOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

*   **Standalone Computing**: The headset can function as its own computer for web browsing and other tasks, displaying 4K windows that can be moved and manipulated with hand gestures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. The system uses selective rendering based on [[user_experience_and_eye_tracking_with_apple_vision_pro | eye tracking]], focusing computing power to sharply render the part of the screen the user is looking at, conserving power elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Mac Integration**: Users can look at a Mac while wearing the headset, and the [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | Vision Pro]] will mirror the Mac's display as one of its 4K windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Bluetooth keyboards and trackpads can also be connected for a full desktop experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   **Communication**: Messaging is available, similar to a Mac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. FaceTime calls are supported, where other participants see a 3D rendered model of the user, scanned from their iPhone, which syncs with their face movements via the headset's sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

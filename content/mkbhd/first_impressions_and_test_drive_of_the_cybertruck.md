The reveal of the Tesla CyberTruck was a highly anticipated event in California, notably one of the few pieces of tech that did not leak in 2019, similar to the Roadster's unveiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>. The event was described as "pretty wild" and "the most showy Tesla event in a while," featuring props, lasers, and excited attendees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Unveiling and Initial Reaction

When the [[tesla_cybertruck_design_and_unveiling | CyberTruck]] rolled out, the immediate reaction was surprise at its unconventional shape and look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. It was likened to a low-polygon render of a pickup truck from a video game, or a fan-made render that one would not expect to be real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This design sparked a "wild" reaction among observers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## [[Tesla CyberTruck design and features | Design and Features]] Overview

Elon Musk presented the CyberTruck's stainless steel exoskeleton, which was impressively demonstrated by Franz hitting it with a sledgehammer without causing a dent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The body is essentially bulletproof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Window Durability Demo

A demonstration of the window's toughness involved dropping a heavy metal ball from a great height onto a sheet of the glass, which did not shatter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. However, when the same ball was lightly tossed at the actual prototype truck, the glass broke both times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. While the ball didn't completely penetrate, it suggested that the prototype might not have had the super-tough glass or that further development was needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

## [[CyberTruck specifications and performance | Performance Specifications]]

The [[tesla_cybertruck_specifications | CyberTruck's specifications]] were a highlight, deemed perhaps the most impressive aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

Key specifications include:
*   **Starting Price**: $40,000 for a single-motor rear-wheel drive variant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **0-60 MPH**:
    *   Single motor, rear-wheel drive: 6.5 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
    *   Triple motor, all-wheel drive: 2.9 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Suspension**: Adaptive suspension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Range**: The triple-motor all-wheel-drive option will have a 500+ mile range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Towing Capacity**: Up to 14,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. For [[comparison_to_other_tesla_models_and_conventional_pickup_trucks | comparison]], the 2024 F-150 can tow about half of that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## In-Person Impressions and Test Drive

In person, the [[tesla_cybertruck_design_and_features | CyberTruck]] is described as "a really striking truck" and "huge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. A test ride was taken in a dual-motor variant, offering a quick one-minute "hot lap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Interior Features and Experience

The interior felt like a "very bare prototype" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Steering Wheel**: Features a yoke steering wheel, similar to the 2020 Roadster prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Touchscreen**: Essentially the same touchscreen as a Model 3, but with new CyberTruck graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   **Space**: Offers tons of glass, space, headroom, and footroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   **Ride Height**: Passengers are very high off the ground, requiring a "hike" to get in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Rearview Mirror**: A display showing the rear-facing camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Seating**: Configured as a six-seater with three bench seats in the front row and three in the back, the middle space between the driver and passenger being a folded-down third seat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Dashboard**: Features a "marble countertop-like blank surface area" in the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

### Acceleration

During the test drive, an acceleration test was performed, with the dual-motor variant quickly reaching 60 MPH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. The truck "clearly hauls" and sounds "crazy with those tires and all that weight," confirming it will be very fast for a pickup truck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

## [[Questions and unknowns about the CyberTruck | Questions and Unknowns about the CyberTruck]]

Despite the unveiling, many details remain unknown:
*   **Release Date**: No specific release date was given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Pre-orders**: Pre-orders and reservations are already available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Missing Features**: Questions remain about the location of windshield wipers and side-view mirrors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   **Bed Material**: The material of the truck bed was not specified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **ATV**: An ATV was brought out at the end of the event, fitting and charging in the back of the CyberTruck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. It is unclear if the ATV will be sold, its price, or if it's an optional accessory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

Tesla's approach is to release details gradually as they finalize production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## Overall Reception and Polarity

The [[tesla_cybertruck_design_and_features | CyberTruck]] is considered "one of the most polarizing automotive designs" ever seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Its unconventional design, featuring angles instead of curves and a triangular cabin, makes it stand out, sharing "pretty much no DNA" with other Tesla models aside from door handles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. The design includes bar headlights, a roof bar headlight, a bar taillight, and "crazy" wheels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

For someone not typically a truck person, it appears "super badass" and "Mars rover type of stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Public opinion seems sharply divided, with people either strongly liking or strongly hating the design, with little middle ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

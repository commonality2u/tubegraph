## Overview
The iPhone 14 lineup introduces satellite connectivity for emergency SOS services, a feature deemed "really impressive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This new capability allows users to send messages in areas where no cellular connection is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Functionality
Traditionally, satellite connectivity is challenging, requiring large antennas, an unobstructed view of the sky, and precise aiming at a satellite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. However, Apple has integrated this sensitivity directly into the iPhone 14's antennas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

A dedicated user interface (UI) assists users in pointing their iPhone directly at a satellite to facilitate sending an emergency message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. The system can package messages into a smaller format, allowing them to be sent within 30 seconds to one or two minutes, even without cellular service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. While it's an edge case feature, the ability to get messages sent in such situations is notable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## Availability and Cost
The satellite connectivity feature is set to launch later in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. It will initially be available in the U.S. and Canada and will be free for the first two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

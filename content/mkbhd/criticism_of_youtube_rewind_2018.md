YouTube Rewind 2018 faced significant criticism upon its release, quickly becoming one of the most disliked videos in YouTube's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Within days, it became the second most disliked video ever, trailing only Justin Bieber's "Baby," and was on track to surpass it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This marked a major shift in public sentiment regarding YouTube Rewind, contrasting sharply with the positive reception of earlier versions from 2013-2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## The Fundamental Disconnect

The core issue with YouTube Rewind 2018, as identified by content creator Kip EHD (MKBHD), stemmed from a fundamental difference in how creators and audiences viewed the annual video versus how YouTube itself saw it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Divergent Perspectives

*   **Creator and Audience View**: Creators and audiences traditionally saw YouTube Rewind as a grand [[creators_perspective_on_youtube_rewind | celebration]] of the year's biggest YouTubers, events, and memes that happened on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. It was perceived as a retrospective look at the most impactful moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **YouTube's View**: As YouTube grew and needed to generate revenue, it increasingly viewed Rewind as a showcase for [[youtubes_relationship_with_advertisers | advertisers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The video became a platform to display "advertiser-friendly" content, featuring "super clean creators" and traditional late-night show hosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Essentially, YouTube Rewind transformed into a "giant ad for YouTube" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### Omissions and Inclusions

The disparity between these views led to significant omissions and questionable inclusions in the 2018 Rewind:
*   **Missing Popular Creators and Events**: Major YouTubers and significant events from 2018, such as PewDiePie, Shane Dawson, and the KSI versus Logan Paul fight, were notably absent despite their massive impact on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Inclusion of Traditional Celebrities**: Conversely, figures like Will Smith, Trevor Noah, and John Oliver were included, even though they were not primarily "YouTubers" or particularly prominent in 2018's YouTube trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Their inclusion was attributed to their appeal to advertisers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## Stylistic Shortcomings

Beyond the content choices, the overall style of YouTube Rewind 2018 was also criticized as being "hard to watch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### Evolution of Rewind's Style

The [[youtube_rewind_concept_and_evolution | concept and evolution]] of YouTube Rewind shows a shift from simplicity to overproduction:
*   **2011 (First Rewind)**: This was a simple, two-minute video featuring Rebecca Black counting down the top 10 most viewed videos of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **2012**: The first year to bring creators in for new content, it was a four-minute Gangnam Style remix with a clear list of featured participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This was considered "peak Rewind as far as actual video style" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   **2013**: The first attempt at a mash-up style, produced by Portal A, this six-minute video featured six songs and 56 creators (plus Cookie Monster and Jimmy Kimmel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. This is speculated to be the first year Rewind was used to engage advertisers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **2014**: The "mashup style" continued, with 95 creators, six songs, and increased fast motion and cutting, leading to "absolute chaos" as they tried to "shove more things in each time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **2017**: This marked the "peak of it all," featuring many late-night talk show hosts, creators, and traditional celebrities in a seven-minute barrage of clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Personal Experience in Rewind 2018

Despite promises to cut back on the number of creators from over 300 to around 100 and to "give creators a voice" in Rewind 2018, the final product remained a "chaotic barrage of clips" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. MKBHD, who participated in the shoot, recounted spending 12 to 14 hours filming various takes for a segment that was ultimately cut down to a brief, almost uninterpretable clip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. He noted that other creators likely had similar experiences, filming for a full day for clips lasting only a few seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This highlights the disconnect between the extensive production efforts and the final, overwhelming viewing experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

## Conclusion and Proposed Solutions

The fundamental problem with YouTube Rewind 2018 is its attempt to simultaneously appeal to advertisers by excluding controversial content and satisfy the community by including hundreds of diverse elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. This "mashup style" makes it seem as though everything is included, while the absence of major cultural moments becomes glaringly obvious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

To improve future YouTube Rewinds, it is suggested that YouTube embrace the idea of deliberately leaving some things out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Instead of trying to please everyone, the video should hand-select a few key moments that truly "popped and represented YouTube that year," harkening back to the more focused style of earlier Rewinds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

The [[display_technology_and_specifications_of_galaxy_s22 | Galaxy S22]] series is described as "boring" but "quietly really really good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This assessment extends to its battery life and overall performance, which, while not "headline making," is "San Antonio Spurs boring level good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Battery Life Concerns and Realities
Initially, there were concerns regarding the battery life of the [[display_technology_and_specifications_of_galaxy_s22 | Galaxy S22]] series due to a few factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>:
*   **Smaller Batteries** Both the [[display_technology_and_specifications_of_galaxy_s22 | Galaxy S22]] and S22+ have batteries that are 300 mAh smaller than their predecessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 Chip** The new Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip, while very efficient and high-performance, runs a little hot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Many flagships using this chip feature massive cooling solutions to manage its heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Display Technology** The lack of full variable refresh rate (LTPO) like in the S22 Ultra also contributed to battery concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

Despite these concerns, the battery life turned out to be adequate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>:
*   **Galaxy S22+** The S22+ can last a solid day and a half, starting at 7:00 AM and lasting until 10:00 PM the next day before dying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **Smaller Galaxy S22** The smaller [[display_technology_and_specifications_of_galaxy_s22 | Galaxy S22]] typically ends a normal day with 10% to 20% battery remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

However, heavy use, such as high-brightness navigation and gaming, can quickly drain the battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. While the 4-nanometer process node of the chip contributes to excellent standby performance, it can be "burned through" with intensive tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Charging Capabilities
The [[display_technology_and_specifications_of_galaxy_s22 | Galaxy S22]] series offers different charging speeds:
*   The [[display_technology_and_specifications_of_galaxy_s22 | Galaxy S22+]] supports 45-watt fast charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   The smaller [[display_technology_and_specifications_of_galaxy_s22 | Galaxy S22]] supports 25-watt charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

Neither phone includes a charger in the box; acquiring the 45-watt charger is an additional $50 expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

## Performance
The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip enables excellent performance, putting up "great numbers" on benchmarks and excelling in gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## Other Considerations
While the battery life is solid, a subtle change from last year's model is the vibration motor. The [[design_and_physical_features_of_galaxy_s22 | Galaxy S22]] uses an x-axis vibration motor instead of a z-axis motor. This change in direction makes the vibrations less strong when the phone is in a pocket or on a table, potentially leading to missed notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

The [[comparing_iphone_16e_to_other_iphone_models | 2025 iPhone 16e]] is positioned as the cheapest new iPhone available, starting at $599, though the tested model costs $900 due to storage upgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. It is explicitly stated as not a budget phone, unlike previous [[pricing_and_value_of_the_iphone_16e | iPhone SE]] models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. The price point makes it harder to recommend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

## Design and Build

The [[design_and_usability_changes_in_the_iphone_16e | iPhone 16e]] employs a "parts bin strategy," reusing engineered components to keep costs down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.
It primarily utilizes the body of the [[iphone_14_pro_features_and_innovations | iPhone 14]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, featuring:
*   Aluminum build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>
*   Flat sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>
*   USB Type-C port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>
*   IP68 water resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>
*   A new single camera ring on the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>
*   An Action Button on the left side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>

The design is described as super clean but also super boring, with a complete lack of text on the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. It is available only in matte black or matte white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. Unlike previous [[pricing_and_value_of_the_iphone_16e | iPhone SE]] models, there are no Product Red options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

## Display

The front of the [[design_and_usability_changes_in_the_iphone_16e | iPhone 16e]] also appears to be from the [[iphone_14_pro_features_and_innovations | iPhone 14]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>:
*   6.1-inch screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>
*   Features a notch and Face ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>
*   Not the brightest display, becoming less visible in direct sunlight compared to other modern displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>
*   Retains a 60 hertz refresh rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>

## Performance and Internals

The [[design_and_usability_changes_in_the_iphone_16e | iPhone 16e]] features the A18 chip, which is the newest silicon straight from the flagship [[iphone_16_and_16_pro_features_and_updates | iPhone 16]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>. However, this is a binned version, having one less GPU core than the flagship A18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. This difference is unlikely to be noticed unless playing intense GPU-taxing games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. Despite this, it remains one of the most powerful phones in its price bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.

### Cellular Modem (C1)
A significant new component is Apple's first in-house-designed cellular modem, named C1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. This marks the first iPhone not to feature a Qualcomm modem, with Apple's own C1 replacing it for 4G, 5G, GPS, and satellite connectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>.
Key aspects of the C1 modem include:
*   Users will likely not notice a difference in performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.
*   Does not support millimeter wave 5G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.
*   Main claimed improvement is efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>.
*   Physically smaller, making room for a larger battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>.

## Camera

The [[design_and_usability_changes_in_the_iphone_16e | iPhone 16e]] features a new single camera on the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>. While it is a 48-megapixel sensor, similar to the [[iphone_16_and_16_pro_features_and_updates | iPhone 16]] and [[iphone_16_and_16_pro_features_and_updates | 16 Pro]], it uses a much smaller sensor with inferior stabilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>.
*   Photos have a different look, with less shallow depth of field and less natural bokeh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>.
*   Maintains sharpness and typical iPhone colors/saturation in good light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.
*   Image quality quickly degrades in low light, becoming softer, less likely to freeze action, and more reliant on night mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.
*   Missing a second lens means it lacks features like Cinematic Mode, Spatial Video, and Macros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>.

## Other Features and Omissions

*   **MagSafe:** The [[design_and_usability_changes_in_the_iphone_16e | iPhone 16e]] does not include MagSafe, relying on slow, first-gen Qi wireless charging (max 7.5 watts) without magnets for alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.
*   **Wireless Connectivity:** Lacks Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.
*   **Ultrawide Band:** Does not have ultrawide band, meaning no precision finding with AirTags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.
*   **Action Button:** While present, it lacks camera control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.
*   **Battery Life:** Battery life is noted as very good, on par with the [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | iPhone 16 Pro]], benefiting from the larger physical size and the efficient C1 modem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>.
*   **Apple Intelligence:** Supports Apple Intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

## Target Audience and Comparison

The [[comparing_iphone_16e_to_other_iphone_models | iPhone 16e]]'s new price point and feature set make it difficult to recommend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. It is seen as a way to push consumers towards the more expensive [[iphone_16_and_16_pro_features_and_updates | iPhone 16]] or [[iphone_16_and_16_pro_features_and_updates | 16 Pro]] models, which offer features like MagSafe and an ultrawide camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>.

A refurbished [[iphone_15_pro_advanced_features | iPhone 15 Pro]] is suggested as a better alternative for around $600, as it offers a brighter, higher refresh rate screen, triple cameras, and similar battery life, despite being a year older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>.

Apple's own comparison tool for the [[design_and_usability_changes_in_the_iphone_16e | iPhone 16e]] shows comparisons only against much older models like [[iphone_12_pro_features | iPhone 12]], [[iphone_12_pro_features | 12 Mini]], [[iPhone 14 Pro features and innovations | iPhone 11]], and older [[pricing_and_value_of_the_iphone_16e | iPhone SEs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>. For users upgrading from these older phones, the [[design_and_usability_changes_in_the_iphone_16e | 16e]] offers a more modern design, a new chip, and Apple Intelligence, making it a "perfectly fine upgrade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:00]</a>. However, the new price is considered not to match the phone's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>.

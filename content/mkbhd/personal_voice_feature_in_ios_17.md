The Personal Voice feature, introduced in [[New Features in iOS 17s Messages and Widgets | iOS 17]], is an accessibility setting designed to help users at risk of losing their voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Unlike many other new features, this was not discussed on stage during Apple's presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Creation Process

To create a personal voice:
1.  Navigate to Settings > Accessibility > Speech section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
2.  Select "Create a personal voice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
3.  The iPhone will prompt the user to find a quiet place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
4.  Users must then say 150 random phrases displayed on the screen into the microphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Examples of phrases include "Sally sold seashells in 1979" and "the president of Morocco is very tall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

All voice compilation occurs locally on the device overnight, ensuring no server involvement in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

## Usage with Live Speech

Once a personal voice is created, it can be used with the Live Speech feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Live Speech is enabled by a triple-tap of the power button, which brings up a text block where users can type anything they wish the synthesized voice to say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

The resulting voice sounds similar to the user, though it might not pass as entirely human, resembling a phone conversation with a poor connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## Purpose

This feature is specifically designed for individuals who might lose their voice due to conditions such as MTD (Motor Neuron Disease) or those whose vocal cords fatigue over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. It allows them to continue interacting with the world using a voice that still sounds like their own, rather than a generic Siri voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

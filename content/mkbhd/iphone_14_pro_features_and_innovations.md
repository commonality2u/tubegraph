The [[iPhone 14 Pro camera enhancements | iPhone 14 Pro]] represents a refined update from Apple, with its primary innovations found in its internals, display, and camera system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Design and External Appearance

The [[iPhone 14 Pro camera enhancements | iPhone 14 Pro]] looks nearly identical to the [[iPhone 13 lineup and features | iPhone 13 Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. There is no radical design or hardware innovation like folding screens or significantly improved charging/battery sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.

Key external details include:
*   **Colors** New Space Black and a new purple color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Camera Bumps** Slightly larger and thicker than those on the [[iPhone 13 lineup and features | iPhone 13 Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Case Compatibility** An [[iPhone 13 lineup and features | iPhone 13 Pro]] case can still fit an [[iPhone 14 Pro camera enhancements | iPhone 14 Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## Internal Upgrades

The [[iPhone 14 Pro camera enhancements | iPhone 14 Pro]] includes several internal advancements:
*   **A16 Bionic Chip** The phone features the new A16 Bionic chip, a top-of-the-line 4-nanometer system-on-a-chip, along with six gigabytes of RAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This is a minor performance bump from the A15 Bionic, benchmarking only slightly above it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. It provides rock-solid performance, fluid animations, and reliable all-day battery life for both the [[iPhone 14 Pro camera enhancements | 14 Pro]] and [[iPhone 14 Pro camera enhancements | 14 Pro Max]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **Crash Detection** New internal sensors, including an improved gyroscope and a better accelerometer, enable "Crash Detection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. If a car crash is detected and the user doesn't respond to on-screen prompts, it automatically calls emergency services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This feature uses multiple sensors and factors like GPS speed, microphone input (for loud noises), barometric pressure changes (for airbags), and gyroscope data (for hard stopping force) to accurately determine a crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **eSIM Only** For the US market, the [[iPhone 14 Pro camera enhancements | iPhone 14 Pro]] is eSIM-only, removing the physical SIM card tray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. This reduces water ingress points and moving parts but makes international travel with local SIM cards less convenient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Satellite Connectivity** All [[iPhone 14 Pro camera enhancements | iPhone 14s]] feature satellite connectivity, allowing users to send messages to dispatchers or emergency services in areas without cellular service by pointing the phone at an overhead satellite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## Display Features

The [[iPhone 14 Pro camera enhancements | iPhone 14 Pro]] and [[iPhone 14 Pro camera enhancements | 14 Pro Max]] feature updated 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch OLED displays, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Brightness** The display has a significantly higher peak brightness of 2000 nits, which is noticeable in bright, sunny conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Always-On Display** This feature is new to the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. The LTPO OLED display drops to 1 Hz, showing the lock screen, clock, and notifications at a lower brightness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The always-on display maintains full color and album art if music is playing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. It automatically turns off when in a pocket, in sleep mode, or when an Apple Watch user walks far away from the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. The always-on display uses slightly more battery than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Island** This software feature cleverly fills the gap between the iPhone's new eye-shaped display cutouts for the selfie camera and Face ID hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. It uses black pixels to create one large pill-shaped area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
    *   **Functionality** The Dynamic Island indicates ongoing and background activities with beautiful, fluid animations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. It works immediately with most apps using existing APIs (like Now Playing or CallKit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
    *   **Examples** It displays system alerts (calls, AirPods connection, charging, silent mode, Face ID unlock) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, live background activities (calls, music, timers, Maps directions, voice memos, screen recording) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>, and microphone/camera access indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
    *   **Interactions** Tapping opens the associated app, while a long press brings up a widget with controls (e.g., media playback) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. When multiple background activities occur, it splits into two sections, functioning as a multitasking app switcher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
    *   **Technology** The Dynamic Island's smooth animations are handled by a new display engine in the A16 Bionic chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. It responds to touches even on the "dead zones" around the physical cutouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
    *   **Impact** While not a "game-changing" feature, it's a significant quality-of-life improvement and is expected to be widely copied by other smartphone manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

## Camera System

The camera system on the [[iPhone 14 Pro camera enhancements | iPhone 14 Pro]] introduces the most significant changes in many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
*   **Main Camera**
    *   A new 48-megapixel sensor, 65% larger than the one on the [[iPhone 12 Pro features | 12 Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
    *   Features second-generation Focus Shift Optical Image Stabilization, 100% Focus Pixels, and an f/1.78 lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
    *   Most photos are binned down to 12 megapixels, benefiting from increased sharpness and light gathering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.
    *   Enables faster shutter speeds, better low-light performance with shorter shutter times, and a natural shallow depth of field without portrait mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.
    *   Manages fringing and autofocus well, with focus pixels effectively tracking subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.
    *   Has a weak minimum focus distance, requiring switching to macro mode for close-up shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.
*   **2x Zoom** The 48-megapixel sensor enables a new 2x zoom option, which is an optical zoom achieved by cropping the middle 12 megapixels of the sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
*   **Action Mode** A new video stabilization mode that provides super-aggressive stabilization for shaky footage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. It applies a heavy crop but can still shoot up to 2.8K resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.
*   **ProRaw** Users can shoot in ProRaw to get full 48-megapixel DNG files (50-70 MB), offering extensive detail and latitude for editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.
*   **8K Video** Despite the 48-megapixel sensor, the [[iPhone 14 Pro camera enhancements | iPhone 14 Pro]] does not support 8K video, possibly due to storage limitations and slow Lightning port transfer speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.
*   **Selfie Camera** Now features 12 megapixels and autofocus, handling various focal lengths better and providing sharper images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. It can, however, still overexpose dark skin tones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.
*   **Cinematic Mode** Now supports 30 frames per second (FPS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
*   **Overall Camera Performance** The [[iPhone 14 Pro camera enhancements | iPhone 14 Pro]] is considered the best camera system in any phone in 2022 due to improvements in shutter speed, photo quality, autofocus, color consistency across cameras, and enhanced image processing for the ultra-wide lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. It can sometimes overbake HDR in harsh conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

## Pricing and Value

The [[iPhone 14 Pro camera enhancements | iPhone 14 Pro]] starts at $1,000, and the [[iPhone 14 Pro camera enhancements | 14 Pro Max]] at $1,100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>. It is considered competitive among $1,000 phones, offering the best camera, a bright and responsive display, the Dynamic Island, and classic iPhone features like iMessage and FaceTime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

For users with an [[Software and features in iPhone 11 Pro | iPhone 11]] or later, the iOS 16 update provides significant user experience improvements that might be comparable to getting a new phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.

## Repairability

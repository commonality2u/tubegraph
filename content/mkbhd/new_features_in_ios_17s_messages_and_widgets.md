iOS 17 introduces many new features, with a focus on refining existing functionalities and adding new capabilities, particularly within its core applications like Messages and through enhancements to widgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. While many features require interaction with other iPhone users, they contribute to a more integrated ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Widgets

A significant improvement in iOS 17 is that widgets are now interactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Previously, widgets primarily served to display information, requiring users to open the corresponding app for interaction. The intention behind widgets was always to allow viewing and interaction with information without launching the app, a capability that is now realized in iOS 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This change is a welcome refinement, addressing a long-standing desire for more functional widgets since their introduction with [[using_widgets_on_ios_14 | iOS 14]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

## Messages Features

The Messages app in iOS 17 receives several new additions, aiming to streamline communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

### Check In

A notable new feature is "Check In," designed to provide peace of mind when someone is traveling or going somewhere alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Instead of manually texting upon arrival or sharing live location, "Check In" automates this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

To use "Check In":
*   Initiate the feature by hitting the plus button in Messages and selecting "Check In" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   The person being checked in on can choose with whom to share their location and how much data they want to share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   A tracker updates the recipient, notifying them when the user has arrived at their destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

### Other Small Enhancements
*   [[iOS 18 Connectivity and Messaging Features | Stickers]] can now be used all over iMessage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   The Messages app, along with other stock applications, benefits from various other small tweaks and additions throughout the operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

Many of these new features, particularly within Messages, are dependent on both parties having an iPhone, leveraging the Apple ecosystem for enhanced functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

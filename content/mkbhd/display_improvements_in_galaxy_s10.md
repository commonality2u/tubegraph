The [[samsung_galaxy_s10_models_overview | Samsung Galaxy S10]] series, including the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10 Plus, introduce significant advancements in display technology. The display is highlighted as one of the three main improvements in these new models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Display Specifications and Quality
The Galaxy S10 features a 6.1-inch display, while the Galaxy S10 Plus boasts a larger 6.4-inch display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Samsung maintains its reputation for having top-tier displays in smartphones, with continuous improvements year after year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

Key display enhancements include:
*   **Screen-to-Body Ratio** A screen-to-body ratio of over 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Resolution and Aspect Ratio** A super-high resolution with a 19:9 tall aspect ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **HDR10+ Certification** The displays are now HDR10+ certified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **"Next-Level Infinity Display"** Samsung has named it the "Next-Level Infinity Display," characterized by its extension to the very edges of the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Camera Cutout (Punch-Hole Design)
A notable design change is the camera cutout located in the top right corner of the display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This is a laser-cut hole in the AMOLED panel, precisely designed to accommodate the front-facing camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

*   The Galaxy S10 features a single 10-megapixel selfie camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   The Galaxy S10 Plus includes an additional depth sensor next to the selfie camera, resulting in a dual cutout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

While this punch-hole design has been seen on other phones, Samsung's cutout appears slightly smaller and less distracting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The design shifts battery and signal indicators from the right edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Samsung also incorporates clever software solutions, such as wallpapers with a dark top-right corner to minimize the cutout's visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, and a fancy animation around the hole when switching to the front-facing [[camera_features_of_galaxy_s10 | camera]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This approach allows Samsung to technically claim it has never used a "notch" design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Apple's September 2021 event unveiled the new iPhone 13 lineup, which includes the iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Mini, iPhone 13 Pro, and iPhone 13 Pro Max <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Overall, this was considered a "pretty small update" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, with the series looking "a lot like the [[iphone_12_design_changes | iPhone 12]] series" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, but with significant updates to the display and cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

## Display Enhancements

All new iPhone 13 models feature brighter screens for improved visibility and HDR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   The iPhone 13 boasts 1000 nits of brightness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   The Pro models (iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max) achieve 1200 nits peak brightness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

A notable design change across all models is a 20% smaller notch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. While retaining the same Face ID hardware and selfie camera, Apple has compressed the notch to reclaim some screen real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### ProMotion Display (120Hz)
The iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max finally incorporate a [[iphone_13_pro_screen_improvements | 120Hz display]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This ProMotion display features a variable refresh rate, ranging from 10Hz all the way up to 120Hz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This variable refresh rate is a key differentiator between the regular iPhone 13 and the Pro models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## Camera System Updates

The iPhone 13 series introduces significant camera improvements.

### iPhone 13 and 13 Mini Cameras
The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini feature a new dual-camera layout with lenses positioned diagonally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Both cameras remain 12 megapixels but come with larger sensors and wider apertures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. They also include sensor-shift optical image stabilization on the main sensor, aiming for better low-light performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

### iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max Cameras
The iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max feature matching triple-camera systems, all 12 megapixels, with wider apertures than the regular iPhone 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This allows for shallower natural depth of field and improved light gathering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. The telephoto lens has been upgraded to 3x optical zoom (up from 2.5x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, and all cameras now support Night Mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. The new Ultra Wide camera can also shoot macro photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

### New Video Features

The iPhone 13 Pro models introduce two significant video features: Cinematic mode and ProRes video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   **Cinematic Mode:** Offers focus tricks and tools for controlling focus in video, including smooth focus racking and AI-based depth detection. This allows users to adjust fake blur and smoothly rack focus between subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **ProRes Video:** Allows users to shoot 4K 30fps ProRes video on the Pro models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. However, the 128GB baseline Pro iPhone models are limited to 1080p ProRes video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

## Performance and Battery

All iPhone 13 models are powered by the new A15 Bionic chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. The Pro models feature a 5-core GPU, while the regular models have a 4-core GPU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

There is a slight battery bump across the lineup, with physically larger batteries leading to a projected "slightly better battery life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>, ranging from one and a half to two and a half hours more use depending on the model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. To accommodate these changes, the new iPhones are "a tiny bit thicker and a little heavier than last year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. They retain the Ceramic Shield front cover and IP68 water resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

## Pricing

The pricing for the iPhone 13 lineup is as follows:
*   **iPhone 13 Mini:** $699 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>
*   **iPhone 13:** $799 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>
*   **iPhone 13 Pro:** $999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>
*   **iPhone 13 Pro Max:** $1099 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>
*   The fully maxed-out one-terabyte iPhone 13 Pro Max is priced at $1599 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

## Conclusion

While presenting a "bunch of small upgrades overall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, it's suggested that existing [[iphone_12_design_changes | iPhone 12]] owners likely "don't need to run out and get an iPhone 13" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. However, the [[iphone_13_pro_screen_improvements | 120Hz display]] on the Pro models could be a compelling reason for users with older iPhones, including the [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 11]] or earlier, to consider an upgrade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

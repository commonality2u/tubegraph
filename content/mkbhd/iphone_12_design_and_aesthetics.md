The [[iPhone 12 design changes | iPhone 12]] series introduced a refreshed design, which is always a significant aspect in the phone world, as the iPhone's design no longer changes as frequently as it once did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:58">[04:06:58]</a>. Design is often what people most anticipate and what identifies the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:36">[04:14:36]</a>. Leaks and rumors often focus on new case designs, dimensions, or camera bump aesthetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:01">[04:25:01]</a>. The physical look and feel in hand are consistently the most exciting unknowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:47">[04:40:47]</a>.

## Overall Design Philosophy
The [[iPhone 12 design changes | iPhone 12]] series features a modern, super-flat design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:39">[04:47:39]</a>. It retains the familiar rectangle shape with rounded corners and is available in various colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. A key characteristic is its flat, 90-degree sides, allowing the phone to stand upright on its edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:06">[04:56:06]</a>. This flatness serves as an identifying trait, reminiscent of older models like the [[iPhone 4 | iPhone 4]], 4S, 5, and 5S <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:27">[05:00:27]</a>. Unlike some phones with "2.5D glass" that curves at the edges, the [[iPhone 12 design changes | iPhone 12]] has straight, flat glass on both the front and back, complemented by a flat stainless steel band around the perimeter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:24">[05:08:24]</a>.

This flat design offers practical benefits:
*   It provides Apple with slightly more internal volume within the same physical shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:58">[05:22:58]</a>.
*   The flatter edges can make the phone easier to hold and grip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:26">[05:30:26]</a>. Some users, however, may find these sharper edges less comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:20">[05:36:20]</a>.

## Finishes and Details
The [[iPhone 12 Pro features | iPhone 12 Pro]] models feature a matte finish on the back, which is a satin texture that resists fingerprints and maintains its appearance over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:10">[05:49:10]</a>. In contrast, the Apple logo, camera bump, and the stainless steel band around the outside have a glossy finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:03">[06:01:03]</a>. While the glossy logo is acceptable, the camera bump's glossy finish (despite the regular [[iPhone 12 design changes | iPhone 12]] having a matte one) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:04">[06:11:04]</a>, combined with raised, sharp camera rings, tends to accumulate a lot of dust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:54">[06:17:54]</a>.

A more notable aesthetic annoyance is the constant fingerprints on the glossy stainless steel rails, making immediate cleaning seem pointless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:23">[06:38:23]</a>. Despite this, other rail elements are well-executed:
*   The power button is slightly larger and remains very clicky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:24">[06:51:24]</a>.
*   The mute switch functions exactly as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:04">[06:55:04]</a>.

Ideally, a hybrid design combining the matte back of the Pro with the matte camera bump and aluminum rails of the standard [[iPhone 12 design changes | iPhone 12]] would be preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>. However, much of the discussion about finishes and grip becomes moot for most users who opt to put their phone in a case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:04">[07:14:04]</a>.

## Size and Ergonomics
The iPhone's size has gradually increased over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:52">[07:27:52]</a>. The [[iPhone 12 Pro features | iPhone 12 Pro]] is considered a preferred size, feeling as large as possible before requiring "hand gymnastics" to reach the notification shade or screen corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:04">[07:33:04]</a>. The [[iPhone 12 design changes | iPhone 12 Pro Max]] has a larger screen, but Apple's software doesn't fully leverage it in a meaningful way, making its size-to-camera/battery trade-off less appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:03">[07:44:03]</a>.

The [[iPhone 12 design changes | iPhone 12]] has an identical size to the Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:26">[08:00:26]</a>. The [[iPhone 12 design changes | iPhone 12 mini]], despite potential battery shortcomings, is praised as the best compact flagship phone available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:01">[08:03:01]</a>.

As a premium device, the [[iPhone 12 Pro features | iPhone 12 Pro]] incorporates high-end industrial design features:
*   It is IP68 certified, meaning the entire body is sealed and resistant to dust, dirt, and liquid submersion up to 6 meters for 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:03">[08:27:03]</a>.
*   Modern iPhones, including the [[iPhone 12 design changes | iPhone 12]], are robust and do not flex or creak when tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:04">[08:57:04]</a>.

The main drawback in terms of physical design is the continued use of the Lightning port in a world shifting towards USB-C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:47">[09:12:47]</a>.

## Haptics
One of the most underrated yet best parts of the iPhone's design is its haptics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:43">[09:29:43]</a>. This is a primary design consideration, with a large space allocated internally for a "taptic engine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:38">[09:36:38]</a>. This linear oscillating vibrator delivers incredibly precise and convincing vibrations that simulate physical taps or phone taps in a pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:08">[09:53:08]</a>. The haptics in the [[iPhone 12 Pro features | iPhone 12 Pro]] are not necessarily an improvement over previous models but remain superior to other phones on the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:44">[10:08:44]</a>. Apple's proficiency in haptics allows them to replace traditional buttons, such as a MacBook trackpad, with flat glass surfaces and a taptic engine underneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:34">[10:17:34]</a>.

## Camera Array Appearance
The triple camera array on the [[iPhone 12 Pro features | iPhone 12 Pro]] is noted to visually resemble a stovetop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:08">[10:29:08]</a>.

## Display Design and the Notch
The display of the [[iPhone 12 Pro features | iPhone 12 Pro]] is a flat 6.1-inch diagonal screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:02">[12:28:02]</a>. It boasts a 2532 x 1170 resolution (460 pixels per inch), an OLED panel with a maximum brightness of 1200 nits (HDR certified), a 2 million to 1 contrast ratio, wide P3 color gamut support, and True Tone automatic white balance adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:04">[12:33:04]</a>. The screen is also coated with a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:56">[12:51:56]</a>.

A prominent design feature is the large notch at the top of the display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:07">[12:57:07]</a>. This cutout houses components for Face ID, including an infrared dot projector, a receiver, an ambient light sensor, a 7-megapixel selfie camera, an earpiece speaker, and a microphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:04">[13:08:04]</a>. While other phone manufacturers have progressively shrunk their notches or moved to hole-punch designs and under-display cameras, the iPhone's notch has remained largely the same size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:07">[13:27:07]</a>. Despite personal dislike for its size, users have generally grown accustomed to it, and Apple seems to believe the majority do not mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:09">[13:55:09]</a>. Rumors suggest it may get slightly smaller in the future but is not expected to disappear soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:49">[14:02:49]</a>.

## Ceramic Shield
The front of the [[iPhone 12 design changes | iPhone 12]] features a layer Apple calls "Ceramic Shield" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:30">[16:30:30]</a>. While not truly ceramic, it is a glass reinforced with a crystallized structure, claimed to offer four times better drop performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:05">[16:35:05]</a>. However, it still scratches at a level 6, with deeper grooves at level 7, and can shatter when dropped, indicating it's not a "magical next-level solution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:56:07">[16:56:07]</a>. Any observed improvement in drop performance is more likely due to the new flat design, where the rails absorb more impact when dropped on an edge, rather than the "Ceramic Shield" itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:05">[17:08:05]</a>. The perfectly flat display also makes it easier to apply a screen protector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:07">[17:42:07]</a>.

## MagSafe Integration
MagSafe is a notable new feature on the [[iPhone 12 design changes | iPhone 12]] series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:54:19">[26:54:19]</a>. It involves a wireless charging puck with magnets that align with the back of the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:00:09">[27:00:09]</a>. This physical integration hints at a future where the charging port might be removed entirely, making MagSafe a potential necessity for charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:07:07">[27:07:07]</a>. It also enables an ecosystem of magnetic accessories that physically snap onto the back of the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:17:16">[27:17:16]</a>. While the MagSafe charging puck itself works well (charging at 15 watts, or 12 watts for the [[iPhone 12 design changes | iPhone 12 mini]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:38:13">[29:38:13]</a>, the magnetic strength for other accessories, like car mounts, can be inconsistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:34:04">[28:34:04]</a>.

## Conclusion on Design
The [[iPhone 12 design changes | iPhone 12]]'s industrial design meets expectations: it looks great, works well, and is surrounded by a vast ecosystem of accessories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:26">[09:00:26]</a>. Despite some aesthetic quirks like the glossy rails and dust-collecting camera bump, and functional design debates like the large notch and Lightning port, the overall design contributes to the iPhone's continued popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:38:43">[36:38:43]</a>.

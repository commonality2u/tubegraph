The [[apple_watch_series_7_features | Apple Watch Series 7]] was announced at Apple's September 2021 event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Overall, it was considered a pretty minor update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## Design and Display
The [[apple_watch_series_7_features | Apple Watch Series 7]] maintains the same shape as previous models, with rumors of a square design proving to be false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The most significant update is to the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>:
*   The bezels around the display are 40% thinner than the Series 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   The screen now curves and "flows" over the edges, extending right up to the metal body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   The larger display is also slightly brighter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

The watch's durability has also been enhanced, featuring harder ceramic and glass on the outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Key components like the sensors, chip (as far as could be told), buttons, and digital crown appear to be the same as the previous generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## Charging and Software

*   It includes a USB-C charger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

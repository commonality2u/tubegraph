    *   It supports recording at up to 240 frames per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Image Quality**
    *   Photos taken are consistently very clean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
    *   The camera tends to prioritize a faster shutter speed to avoid blurriness, similar to the OnePlus One <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
    *   It can increase ISO and relies on its top-notch image processing to clean up noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
    *   Excellent image processing results in crispy clean shots with excellent color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Low Light Performance**
    *   A fast, wide-open aperture lens contributes to great low-light performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

## Specifications

*   **Megapixels**: The camera is still an 8-megapixel sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   **Sensor Size**: It uses a one-third inch sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Design**: The camera lens on the back protrudes slightly due to the phone's thinness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. However, this is not a significant issue as the lens is coated in sapphire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, though it may cause the phone to rock slightly when placed on a flat surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Limitations

> [!WARNING] No 4K Video
> The main downside of the [[Camera performance and features|iPhone 6]] camera is its 8-megapixel sensor, which means it cannot shoot 4K video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. 4K resolution requires 8.3 megapixels, so the 8MP sensor is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. It is anticipated that the next iPhone will support 4K video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

The Rabbit R1 is a compact, dedicated AI device designed to function as an "AI in a box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It shares several similarities, for better or worse, with the [[comparison_with_humane_ai_pin | Humane Ai Pin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## [[design_and_features | Design and Features]]

The Rabbit R1 is a non-wearable device designed to be carried like a smartphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. It is described as being about the size of a stack of Post-its <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

*   **Physical Design**: It is a lightweight, bright orange plastic cube designed by Teenage Engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Its distinctive appearance makes it very recognizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The device's color is notoriously difficult to photograph accurately due to its extreme saturation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   **Controls**:
    *   **Button**: A single button on the right side is pressed and held to ask questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Pressing it once puts the device to sleep, and again to wake it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
    *   **Screen**: It features a built-in screen, unlike some competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This 2.9-inch diagonal TFT screen lacks auto-brightness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. The screen displays the answer text, a bouncing rabbit animation (indicating it's awake), time, and battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
    *   **Scroll Wheel**: A scroll wheel is used for navigating the user interface (UI) and selecting items with the button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   **Camera**: It includes a swiveling camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, which can be double-tapped to open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. The AI assistant is multimodal, allowing users to ask questions about what the camera sees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Connectivity**: It has a SIM card tray for cellular connectivity and a USB Type-C port for charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Headphones can be connected via Bluetooth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Performance**: The Rabbit R1 sends most requests to the cloud, but it feels significantly quicker at answering questions compared to the [[comparison_with_humane_ai_pin | Humane Ai Pin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. For example, it can summarize long emails or articles viewed through its camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **User Interface (UI) Interactions**: To access settings, users must shake the device like an Etch A Sketch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The device also supports a "terminal mode" where it can be turned sideways for a keyboard to pop up on the touchscreen, allowing typed questions and text answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Drawbacks

The Rabbit R1 faces several [[drawbacks_of_the_humane_ai_pin | limitations]] and issues:

*   **Battery Life**: The 1000 mAh battery is "brutally bad," draining visibly even when idle and lasting only about four hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. It requires multiple charges per day and may still be dead by morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Charging from zero to 100% takes 45 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. It lacks fast or wireless charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Missing Basic Features**: The device lacks fundamental assistant capabilities such as setting alarms, timers, recording videos or photos, sending emails, or a built-in calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **AI Hallucinations**: Similar to other AI assistants, the Rabbit R1 can "hallucinate" and confidently provide incorrect answers to questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **Scroll Wheel Usability**: The scroll wheel, while visually appealing due to its protrusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, is frustrating to use. Its sensitivity is dialed down to prevent accidental scrolling, making navigation slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. There is no haptic feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, and no "back" button, requiring users to scroll all the way back up to exit menus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Adjusting brightness or volume requires two hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   **Limited Touchscreen Functionality**: Despite having a touchscreen, its use is largely restricted to typing in terminal mode. It cannot be used for navigating menus or other general UI interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

## Key Differentiators and Future Promises

Rabbit aims to differentiate the R1 through its price tag and a "large action model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

### Pricing and Hardware Cost

The Rabbit R1 costs $200 with no subscription fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the [[humane_ai_pin_features_and_functionality | Humane Ai Pin]], which costs $700 plus a $24 monthly subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

However, the $200 price point reflects cost-cutting measures:
*   A separate SIM card and associated data plan are required for cellular connectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   The unboxing experience is minimal, with no charging brick, USB-C cable, or instruction manual included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   The device is made of plastic, albeit well-built with no flexing or creaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   It features a very basic camera, a cheap speaker, and a low-end MediaTek chip (the same as in a $150 phone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

### Large Action Model (LAM)

The Rabbit R1, like the [[humane_ai_pin_features_and_functionality | Humane Ai Pin]], does not support apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Instead, its core differentiator is its "large action model" (LAM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

*   **Concept**: While large language models (LLMs) process natural language into words, a LAM is designed to take natural language input and translate it into actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. The theory is that it can use apps on behalf of the user, similar to how a human would, without relying on restrictive APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. It's envisioned as a "virtual agent" capable of recognizing major UI elements like play or buy buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

*   **Current State**: As of its release, only four apps are currently available through the online "Rabbit Hole" portal: Spotify, Uber, DoorDash, and Midjourney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Even these are described as "half-working," with issues like playing the wrong song or incorrect DoorDash orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

*   **Future Roadmap**:
    *   **800 Trained Apps**: Rabbit claims to have trained its LAM on 800 different apps, but they lack a built-in UI on the device and are not yet available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
    *   **Generative UI**: Theoretically, a "generative UI" is in development, which would allow the R1 to recognize an app type and build a UI for it automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. This is also theoretical and "still in the works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
    *   **Teach Mode**: "Teach Mode" is envisioned as a feature where the Rabbit R1 can observe a user performing actions with a mouse and keyboard, learn from those actions, and then repeat them later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. This feature is also not currently available and is expected later in the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] [[challenges_of_first_generation_tech | Challenges of First-Generation Tech]]
> A significant industry trend highlighted is the sale of "unfinished products" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. Companies are increasingly selling devices with promises of future features via updates, making it difficult to review them based on their current, often "half-baked" or "borderline nonfunctional" state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. This affects various categories, including gaming, cars, and smartphones, and is particularly acute in AI-based products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. Buyers pay full price upfront for something that might only reach its promised potential years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

## Conclusion

The Rabbit R1 represents an attempt to create a super-personalized AI assistant that can perform human-like tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. Its low price of $200 is a strategic move to encourage widespread adoption, allowing Rabbit to collect valuable real-world data, much like Tesla did with its autopilot beta testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. The hope is that with enough data and development, the device's promised features, such as the 800 trained apps or Teach Mode, will eventually make it a worthwhile investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

However, a key challenge for the Rabbit R1 is that it lacks an immediate, compelling reason for people to buy it today, unlike Tesla cars which were popular for other reasons beyond just autopilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

The advice given is to "Buy the product based on what it is today, and not what it's promised to be in the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. The future of this product category will also likely be shaped by upcoming developments from major companies like Google and Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.

The [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | iPhone 15 Pro]] and [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | iPhone 15 Pro Max]] introduce several advanced features compared to previous models and the baseline iPhone 15, primarily focusing on build quality, internal chip, and camera capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## A17 Pro Chip

The [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | iPhone 15 Pro]] models are powered by the A17 Pro chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **First "Pro" Chip**: This is the first time Apple has used the "Pro" designation for an iPhone chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **3-Nanometer Architecture**: It is Apple's first 3-nanometer chip, promising performance and efficiency improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **Performance**: High-performance cores are about 10% faster, and the neural engine is up to twice as fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **USB 3 Controller**: The A17 Pro chip includes a new USB 3 controller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. This allows the [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | iPhone 15 Pro]]'s USB-C port to achieve faster data transfer speeds of up to 10 gigabits per second, unlike the base iPhone 15 models which are limited to USB 2.0 speeds (480 megabits per second) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. This is particularly beneficial for users who transfer large ProRes video or ProRaw photo files from their device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### Charging
Despite the switch to USB-C, the [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | iPhone 15 Pro]] models do not offer faster charging, maintaining the same 20-watt charging speeds as previous iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. A full charge can still take an hour and a half to two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

## [[iPhone 15 Pro design and build changes | Design and Build Changes]]

The [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | iPhone 15 Pro]] features significant changes to its external design and materials.
*   **Titanium Rails**: The shiny, fingerprint-prone stainless steel rails have been replaced with a new Grade 5 titanium alloy featuring a brushed texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
    *   **Lighter Weight**: This change makes the phones noticeably lighter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
    *   **Thinner Bezels**: The titanium build also allowed for a slightly shrunken body, enabling the screen to extend closer to the edges with thinner bezels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **New Colors**: Available colors include black, white, a subtle new blue, and "natural" which embraces the raw titanium feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Improved Repairability**: Apple redesigned parts of the internal chassis to make the back glass more easily replaceable, signaling a step towards more repairable iPhone designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

## Action Button

A major new feature on the [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | iPhone 15 Pro]] models is the customizable Action Button, which replaces the traditional mute switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Default Behavior**: By default, it functions as a mute switch, requiring a press-and-hold to toggle silent mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Customization Options**: In settings, the Action Button can be configured for various functions:
    *   Toggle mute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
    *   Activate a specific Focus Mode (e.g., Do Not Disturb) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
    *   Launch the camera in a specific mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
    *   Turn on the flashlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
    *   Open Voice Memos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
    *   Toggle the Magnifier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
    *   Trigger any Siri Shortcut, allowing it to launch almost any app or perform complex actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

## Camera Enhancements

The [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | iPhone 15 Pro]] lineup features significant camera upgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Main Sensor**: Both Pro models include a new, larger 48-megapixel main sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **Ultrawide**: An improved ultrawide camera is also present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   **iPhone 15 Pro Max Telephoto**: The [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | iPhone 15 Pro Max]] exclusively receives a new, intricate folding 5X telephoto camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. The standard [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | iPhone 15 Pro]] retains the 3X telephoto lens from the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   **Default Focal Length Customization**: A new feature allows users to change their default focal length in the camera settings to 1X, 1.2X, or 1.5X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Once set, the 1X button in the camera app will automatically switch to the chosen default focal length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

## Pricing

The [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | iPhone 15 Pro]] starts at the same price as its predecessor: $999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. However, the [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | iPhone 15 Pro Max]] sees a price increase, starting at $1,199 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. This higher starting price for the Pro Max is attributed to its exclusive 5X camera and a higher base storage of 256GB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

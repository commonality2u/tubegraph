The new 14-inch and 16-inch 2021 MacBook Pros mark a significant shift in Apple's approach to [[design_and_features | design]], particularly with the reintroduction of "real ports" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This decision to "walk back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a> from previous generations' port minimalism is a welcome change, eliminating the constant need for dongles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## Available Ports

The MacBook Pros feature a generous array of connectivity options:

### Right Side
*   **Full-size HDMI Port**: A welcome return that functions as HDMI 2.0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. While not the latest 2.1 standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, it still supports 4K 60Hz output, making it suitable for connecting to projectors or TVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Thunderbolt 4 Port**: One of several high-speed ports available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Full-size Half-depth SD Card Slot**: Essential for professionals like video creators who frequently use SD cards for audio or footage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. It supports UHS-2 speeds (up to 300 MB/s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, although it doesn't support the newer UHS-3 standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

### Left Side
*   **Two Thunderbolt 4 Ports**: Providing versatile high-speed connections for peripherals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Headphone Jack**: This improved jack supports high-impedance headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. While not a "super clean DAC" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, it offers significantly more power than previous versions, allowing high-impedance headphones (e.g., 250 ohm Beyerdynamic DT770 Pros) to reach comfortable volume levels at about 65% volume, compared to 100% on a MacBook Pro M1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This means one less external Thunderbolt DAC to carry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Magnetic MagSafe Charging Port**: The MagSafe port has returned, offering a newer, thinner, and stronger magnetic connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. It has increased lateral strength, making it more resilient to accidental tugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Charging and Power

The laptops come with powerful charging bricks:
*   **14-inch MacBook Pro**: Includes a 96-watt power adapter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **16-inch MacBook Pro**: Features a large 140-watt rectangular charging brick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Fast Charging**: Both models support fast charging via MagSafe, achieving approximately 50% charge in half an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **USB-C Charging**: Users can also charge the laptops via any USB-C port, though at a slower 96-watt rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Design Note**: The charging brick is separate from the braided USB-C cable with MagSafe on the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. However, the MagSafe connector for the Space Gray laptop does not come in Space Gray, which would have been a nice aesthetic touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## The "One Less Dongle" Theme

The overall [[design_and_features | design]] philosophy behind the port selection appears to be user convenience and reducing the reliance on external adapters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. While some ports, like HDMI 2.0 and UHS-2 SD card slot, are not the absolute bleeding edge, they are "good in a pinch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a> and serve to save users from carrying extra dongles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

> "There's just something hilarious about them going backwards on the last four years of MacBook Pros and actually adding ports back to it. It's not something they do all the time so I'm giving a thumbs up on that." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>

A missed opportunity mentioned was the lack of an Ethernet port on the power brick, similar to what was done with the M1 iMac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

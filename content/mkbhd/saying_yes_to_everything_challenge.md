From: [[mkbhd]] <br/> 

For one month, the creator undertook a challenge to say yes to every product review request that landed in their inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This initiative, while a personal experiment, also shed light on the [[challenges for content creators with product reviews | challenges faced by content creators]] and smaller companies in the product review space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

## Products Reviewed

The challenge led to a diverse array of products being sent for review, ranging from high-tech gadgets to unexpected items.

### Titan Orion Series Casket

The first product reviewed was a literal casket, specifically the Titan Orion series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Background**: This model gained notoriety for being the casket Taylor Swift emerged from in her "Anti-Hero" music video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Company Mission**: Titan Caskets aims to disrupt the funeral industry by selling direct-to-consumer, cutting out middlemen (funeral homes) who contribute to significant markups (e.g., $5,000-$10,000 for a casket) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Price**: The Orion casket costs $1299 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, with a "Swifty" checkout code offering $50 off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Product Details**: It's a standard, high-quality steel casket with a locking mechanism and rubber gaskets; its innovation lies in the direct-to-consumer sales model rather than the casket itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The reviewer noted it was "pretty comfortable for a casket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### Conquest VR Headset Audio Solution

A $179-$200 headset designed to clip onto a VR headset, providing high-res audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: Aims to be a lightweight audio solution for VR users who typically need earbuds or another headset over their VR device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Review**: Rated 7 out of 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. While functional, it's considered expensive compared to lightweight wireless headphones that offer similar benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

*   **Review**: Rated 5 out of 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. It works, but the reviewer questioned its value, suggesting a scarf might be more practical for warmth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. The need for an app was also noted as "not ideal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

*   **MagSafe**: While it allows MagSafe charging, it does not provide the "full MagSafe experience" with the accompanying animation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Review**: Rated 3 out of 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. It accomplishes its stated purpose of putting a face on a case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, but the build quality was questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

*   **Compatibility**: Supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. The backup camera can see in the dark with an LED light and needs to be wired to the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   **Review**: Rated 8 out of 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. It offers significant functionality without needing to buy a new car, though [[Challenges of first generation tech | wiring it in an older car]] presents a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

### Gravastar Sirius P5s Earbuds

*   **Features**: Priced at $80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, they have an IPX4 rating, 40-hour battery life, and electronic noise cancellation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Design**: The case is spring-loaded and features lights on the back for charging indication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. The earbuds themselves are metallic and heavy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **Gimmicks**: They feature a unique customization aspect where the inner tray holding the earbuds can be removed from the main case by unscrewing a Flathead screw and inserted into different outer case designs, such as a "metal Chomper" design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. This level of earbud customization is rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Review**: Rated 7 out of 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. A major drawback was that the earbuds did not stay in the reviewer's ears, rendering them unusable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. They also didn't sound great <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

*   **Design**: A contraption of plastic and hinges with a display on each side, coming with various cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. It adjusts to fit different laptop sizes, folding around the central screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

## Learnings from the Challenge

While in a fortunate position to undertake such a challenge, the experience illuminated aspects of product reviews for other creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
*   **Product Availability**: Many smaller companies have limited products for reviews and want guaranteed video coverage in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. This often leads them to request or require creators to sign contracts promising a video if they receive a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
*   **Creator Advice**: Creators are advised *not* to sign contracts that guarantee a video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.
*   **Overall**: The challenge reaffirmed the creator's usual practice of declining 99% of requests, viewing their high volume of requests as a positive problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

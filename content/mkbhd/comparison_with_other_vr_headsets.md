The Apple Vision Pro stands out in the [[virtual_reality_vr_and_augmented_reality_ar | VR headset]] market due to its unique approach and features, though it comes with specific trade-offs when compared to existing devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

## Key Comparison Points

### Display Fidelity
The Vision Pro features the "sharpest, best looking micro-OLED display" among various [[virtual_reality_vr_and_augmented_reality_ar | VR headsets]] currently available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. The individual pixels on these displays are 7.5 microns, allowing 64 Vision Pro pixels to fit into the size of a single iPhone screen's pixel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. This design eliminates visible individual pixels and the "screen door effect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. The native refresh rate is 90 hertz, increasing to 96 hertz for 24 FPS content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. Apple also calibrates each display from the factory for maximum color accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.

To manage the high pixel count, the Vision Pro utilizes foveated rendering combined with fast eye tracking. This means only the area a user is directly looking at is rendered in high resolution, with the periphery remaining soft and fuzzy, mimicking natural human vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

### Field of View (FOV)
A notable drawback affecting immersion in the Vision Pro is its field of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. While the center of the view is sharp, the edges of the headset appear "a little bit further in than the edges of your vision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. This creates a slight "cone effect" with some chromatic aberration around the outside, giving the feeling of "looking into a large tunnel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. Apple has not published FOV numbers for the Vision Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. In [[comparison_with_other_gaming_systems_of_the_era | comparison]], the Quest 3 offers a "better, wider field of view" when looking inside the headset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.

### Passthrough Technology
The Vision Pro boasts the "best passthrough of any headset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>, offering a highly transparent view of the real world. This is achieved through high-quality camera feeds and displays, minimizing eye fatigue even during extended use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. The total latency from external light hitting sensors to the image updating in the headset is 12 milliseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>.

Despite its quality, it's still mediated through cameras and screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>. Visual artifacts like hand occlusion breaking or objects floating in low lighting conditions can occur, though these are less frequent than in other systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>.

### Mac Virtual Display
While remote desktop viewing is available on other devices like the Quest 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>, the Vision Pro's Mac Virtual Display is considered "way more interesting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>. This feature connects to a Mac and renders a new virtual display, rather than mirroring the existing one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>. This allows users to create a monitor as large as desired and simultaneously open other Vision Pro apps around it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>.

### Comfort and Weight
The Vision Pro is heavier than many other headsets, weighing nearly 650 grams compared to the Quest 3's 515 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>. This 25% weight difference is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:59:00">[16:59:00]</a>. The primary cause of discomfort with the standard Solo Knit strap is that it distributes all the weight to the front of the face, creating pressure points above the eyes and on the cheeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:11:00">[18:11:00]</a>. Extended use (over 30-45 minutes) can be difficult with this strap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:00">[18:28:00]</a>.

Apple includes a Dual Loop Band, which, despite being less aesthetically appealing and harder to adjust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:53:00">[18:53:00]</a>, significantly improves comfort by distributing weight to the top of the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:00">[19:30:00]</a>. This makes longer sessions (e.g., two hours) possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>.

### Price and Value
The Vision Pro is positioned as a "really expensive, really fun toy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:00">[21:51:00]</a>. Its high price point of $3,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:11:00">[24:11:00]</a> means that "much cheaper competitors" like the $500 Quest 3 are often recommended as more accessible alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:56:00">[23:56:00]</a>.

The initial app selection for the Vision Pro is limited to around 600 dedicated apps at launch, though it is compatible with millions of iPad apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>. Major apps like YouTube, Netflix, Spotify, and TikTok were not available at launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>. However, the entry of Apple into the [[virtual_reality_vr_and_augmented_reality_ar | VR/AR]] space is expected to "rapidly improve the value proposition" through increased developer attention and new applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:07:00">[24:07:00]</a>.

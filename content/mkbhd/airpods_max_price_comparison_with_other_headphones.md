Apple has expanded its headphone lineup with the introduction of new over-ear wireless noise-canceling headphones called [[AirPods Max]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. These headphones are priced at $550 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Pricing Details and Additional Costs
The [[AirPods Max]] retail for $550 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, a price point that warrants thorough testing and consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. The package includes a USB Type-C to Lightning charging cable, but notably, there is no power brick or audio cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. An audio cable, if desired, must be purchased separately for an additional $35 from Apple's website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

The ear cups of the [[AirPods Max]] are magnetically attached and can be easily replaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, which is a smart design choice as ear cups typically wear out over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. However, a new set of ear pads costs $60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This also allows users to mix and match colors if they purchase different colored ear pads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## [[Comparison with other high end headphones]]

### Versus Sony XM4s
A direct comparison is often drawn between the [[AirPods Max]] and Sony's XM4s, which are widely considered top-of-the-line, industry-favorite noise-canceling wireless headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Key differences at their price points include:
*   **Price**: Sony XM4s are priced at a maximum of $350, often found for less, making them $200 cheaper than the [[AirPods Max]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Noise Cancellation**: The XM4s offer "absolute best noise cancellation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, while [[AirPods Max]] are "right about on par with [[AirPods Pro sound quality]]" for white noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **Design and Portability**: XM4s are lighter (250 grams compared to [[AirPods Max]]'s 386 grams) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. They also fold for travel and come with a more protective real case, unlike the [[AirPods Max]]'s "Smart Case" which doesn't allow folding or full protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Battery Life**: XM4s offer a longer 30-hour battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   **Included Accessories**: XM4s include an audio cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

Based on these metrics, the Sony XM4s appear to outperform [[AirPods Max]] in many practical aspects for a lower price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

### Versus Ultra High-End and Audiophile Headphones
The reviewer suggests that the [[AirPods Max]] might be better compared to super ultra high-end, reference-grade headphones, similar to how the Pro Display XDR is evaluated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   **Sennheiser (High-End)**: Comparing them to $2,400 Sennheiser headphones used for editing, the [[AirPods Max]] could be seen as a lighter-weight, wireless, smaller, and cheaper alternative that works with more devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   **Mid-to-High-End Audiophile**: Another potential comparison point is somewhere in the middle, with headphones like the Sennheiser HD 650 or Drop THX Panda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. In this scenario, the [[AirPods Max]] would represent Apple's entry into the high-end audiophile space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

## Initial Verdict on Value
While the [[AirPods Max]] sound "really good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>, the question remains whether they sound "$550 good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>, especially as they approach the limits of wireless audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Their exceptional build quality alone might not justify the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. Similarly, Apple's smart features, though comprehensive, may not by themselves compel a purchase at this price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. The combination of all these elements might appeal to a specific audience, as indicated by the headphones being sold out already <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

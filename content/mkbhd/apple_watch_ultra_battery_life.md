The [[Battery Life and Charging | Apple Watch Ultra]] offers significantly improved battery performance compared to previous Apple Watch models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This enhancement is largely due to its larger size, which allows for more internal battery capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## Real-World Usage Example

During a test, the [[Battery Life and Charging | Apple Watch Ultra]] demonstrated impressive longevity:
*   Started on Saturday morning with 100% [[Battery Life and Charging | battery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.
*   After driving to a three-hour ultimate frisbee practice, driving home, and continuing through the day, it ended the day with approximately 69% [[Battery Life and Charging | battery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   After sleeping with the watch on for sleep tracking, it woke up on Sunday morning with 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   Following another three-hour ultimate frisbee practice in New York City and continuing through the rest of the day, including sleep tracking again, it reached Monday morning with 20% [[Battery Life and Charging | battery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

This test indicates that the [[Battery Life and Charging | Apple Watch Ultra]] can last two days and two nights, extending into a third day, which is a significant improvement over any other Apple Watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Comparison to Other Apple Watches

The [[Battery Life and Charging | Apple Watch Ultra]] offers roughly double the [[Battery Life and Charging | battery life]] compared to the Apple Watch Series 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. While the standard Apple Watch (Series 8) is a versatile smartwatch, the [[Battery Life and Charging | Apple Watch Ultra]] caters to users for whom the regular model wasn't sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The improved [[Battery Life and Charging | battery]] is one of the three main additions to the Ultra, alongside ruggedness and specialized features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

The longer [[Battery Life and Charging | battery]] also means that even for less demanding activities like an ultimate frisbee workout (which primarily measures heart rate constantly), the [[Battery Life and Charging | Apple Watch Ultra]] only depletes about 20% [[Battery Life and Charging | battery]] during practice, compared to 40% on previous models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

## Comparison to Other High-End Watches

Despite its significant improvement over other Apple Watch models, the [[Battery Life and Charging | Apple Watch Ultra's]] two-day [[Battery Life and Charging | battery life]] is still not as impressive as some other high-end watches, which can last weeks, months, or even years without needing to be charged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. For example, some Casio Pro Trek watches with solar charging have "virtually infinite" [[Battery Life and Charging | battery life]] and don't even come with a charger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

## Battery Enhancements for Athletes

The [[Battery Life and Charging | Apple Watch Ultra's]] significantly improved [[Battery Life and Charging | battery life]] is crucial for ultra-endurance athletes who participate in events like Iron Man races or ultra marathons, where previous Apple Watch models didn't last long enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

Apple has also announced a future software update that will introduce a new [[Battery Life and Charging | battery]] optimization setting specifically for workouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. This feature, distinct from the existing low power mode, will ping GPS and heart rate less often during extended workouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. When this setting is activated, Apple claims it can essentially triple the [[Battery Life and Charging | Apple Watch Ultra's]] life, offering up to 60 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. This will be beneficial for activities like 100-mile runs where a broader sense of data is sufficient, rather than constant multiple pings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

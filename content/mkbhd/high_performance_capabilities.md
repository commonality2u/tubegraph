When the new MacBook Pros were announced, the immediate question arose whether they could replace the need for a "travel iMac" that was previously lugged to tech events for video rendering, editing, and export [00:00:32]. The Apple silicon transition for Macs has been described as "pretty impressive," with these new laptops being "next level" in their [[performance_and_limitations|performance]] [00:01:03].

## Design and [[performance_features_and_driving_experience|Performance Features]]
The new 14-inch and 16-inch 2021 MacBook Pros are described as "incredible" due to significant jumps in both internal and external design [00:01:17]. The aesthetically thicker design provides more room for back and side vents, which aids in better ventilation, although the fans are rarely heard [00:01:56].

## Return of Practical [[port_selection_and_functionality|Ports]]
A notable change is the return of "real [[port_selection_and_functionality|ports]]" [00:02:25], which Apple had previously removed from MacBook Pros [00:02:31]. These include:
*   Full-size HDMI port [00:02:43] (HDMI 2.0, supporting 4K 60Hz, though not HDMI 2.1 [00:06:01]).
*   Thunderbolt 4 ports (one on the right, two on the left) [00:02:48].
*   Full-size half-depth SD card slot (UHS 2 speeds, 300 megabytes per second, not UHS 3) [00:02:51].
*   Magnetic MagSafe charging port [00:03:08].

The MagSafe is a newer, thinner, and stronger version [00:03:18], providing safer charging than USB-C alone [00:03:30]. The 14-inch MacBook Pro comes with a 96-watt power adapter (an upgrade from 67-watt base models), while the 16-inch model includes a 140-watt charging brick [00:03:35]. These allow for fast charging, reaching approximately half charge in half an hour [00:04:07]. USB-C charging is also an option, delivering about 96 watts [00:04:15].

### Enhanced Headphone Jack
The headphone jack now supports high impedance headphones, addressing a need for audio professionals by potentially reducing the need for an external Thunderbolt DAC [00:04:30]. While not an "incredible super clean DAC," it pushes more power than previous models, reaching comfortable listening levels for 250 ohm headphones at 65% volume compared to 100% on M1 MacBook Pro [00:05:25]. This feature contributes to saving a dongle [00:05:57].

## Keyboard and Audio Improvements
The new MacBook Pros feature a revamped keyboard without the Touch Bar, replaced by a full row of full-height physical function keys [00:07:14]. The keys offer good travel, similar to Apple's keyboards from five years prior [00:07:43]. The Touch ID button is quick and reliable [00:07:50]. The speakers, especially on the 16-inch model, are considered the "biggest, fullest, best speakers" heard in a laptop [00:08:10], and the studio microphones are also improved [00:08:20].

## Display Technology
The new displays are "incredible," featuring 10-bit mini-LED HDR panels with a 16:10 aspect ratio, almost 4K resolution, and high refresh rate [00:08:27].
*   Max brightness reaches 1600 nits when watching HDR content [00:08:58].
*   Thinner bezels have been introduced [00:09:04].
*   ProMotion offers adaptive refresh rates up to 120Hz, leading to smoother UI navigation and large animations, particularly noticeable when scrubbing through a Final Cut Pro timeline [00:09:14].

### The Notch
The display includes a notch housing a new 1080p webcam, an ambient light sensor, and an LED light [00:10:17]. While its size has been questioned [00:10:31], the software adapts by treating the screen as if there's no notch, turning the menu bar black in full-screen applications, effectively making it disappear [00:11:14]. The notch does not cut into content [00:11:35].

## Core [[performance_and_capabilities_of_the_ford_f150_lightning|Performance and Capabilities]]
The new MacBook Pros deliver on Apple's promised [[performance_and_capabilities_of_the_ford_f150_lightning|performance]] [00:13:01].
*   **Synthetic Benchmarks**: They achieved the highest single-core Geekbench CPU score ever seen from any Mac [00:13:44]. Multi-core scores were comparable to a maxed-out 18-core iMac [00:13:51]. Cinebench also showed impressive single-core scores [00:13:54].
*   **Real-World [[performance_and_capabilities_of_the_ford_f150_lightning|Performance]]**: The "real world capabilities" are "dramatically better than they have any business doing" [00:14:06]. This is attributed to higher memory bandwidth, increased GPU cores, and vertical integration [00:14:15].
*   **Media Engine**: The chips include a dedicated media engine with a ProRes accelerator (M1 Max has two) [00:14:38]. This significantly enhances video work:
    *   Encoding video with Compressor is 10 times faster than on Intel MacBook Pros [00:14:54].
    *   Editing 8K Red Code RAW footage in Final Cut Pro is "shockingly well" handled, with seamless scrubbing and chopping [00:15:25]. Playback in high quality mode only dropped a few frames [00:15:43]. The delay between pressing play and playback starting is less than a quarter of a second [00:16:06].
*   **Export Times**:
    *   M1 Pro 14-inch MacBook Pro exported a project in 6 minutes and 40 seconds [00:16:41].
    *   A $50,000 28-core Mac Pro did the same in 5 minutes and 42 seconds [00:16:48].
    *   The M1 Max MacBook Pro finished in 4 minutes and 6 seconds [00:16:59].
    *   The M1 Max MacBook Pro with "High Power Mode" enabled achieved an even faster export time of 3 minutes and 49 seconds, without audible fan spin [00:17:48].

## Broader Professional Applications
The new MacBook Pros are praised across various professional workflows:
*   **Adobe Software**: The Verge's review noted impressive findings with After Effects, which now takes advantage of multi-threaded GPU rendering, and outperforming mobile RTX 3080s in Premiere [00:18:26].
*   **Music Production**: Music producers and sound designers appreciate the "whisper silent" computer's ability to process more audio effects [00:18:40].
*   **Photography**: Importing and generating previews in photography apps is twice as fast as on a 2018 MacBook Pro [00:18:52]. The M1 Max can open every app simultaneously and stream multiple ProRes videos without issue [00:19:02].
*   **App Development**: A Reddit staff engineer tweeted that the machine cut build times for their Android app in half, indicating significant cost savings for teams [00:19:10].

## [[performance_and_limitations|Performance and Limitations]] with Battery Life
Despite their high [[performance_and_limitations|performance]], these laptops are "incredibly efficient" [00:19:44].
*   The 16-inch model (100 watt-hour battery) offers longer battery life than the 14-inch (70 watt-hour battery) [00:19:50].
*   The M1 Pro will last longer than the M1 Max, as the extra GPU cores in the M1 Max use more power [00:19:57].
*   Overall, they offer "all day, best in class" battery life, comparable to the M1 MacBook Pro [00:20:10].
*   Intensive tasks like video editing in high power mode can deplete the battery in about four hours [00:20:20], but fast charging makes this manageable [00:20:28].

## M1 Pro vs. M1 Max
The choice between M1 Pro and M1 Max depends on specific needs [00:20:48]. The M1 Max is the most powerful, but it consumes more battery life [00:21:16]. Upgrading to M1 Max is recommended if your applications specifically benefit from the extra GPU cores [00:21:23]. While not designed for gaming, the M1 Max would theoretically handle [[8k_gaming_capabilities|8K gaming capabilities]] better than the M1 Pro [00:21:28].

Ultimately, these new MacBook Pros are considered a "really, really good tool" and are "next level" in specific optimized areas [00:21:38]. They are particularly beneficial for professionals in creative fields [00:21:50].

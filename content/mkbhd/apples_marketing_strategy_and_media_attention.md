Apple employs a sophisticated marketing strategy that balances competitive pricing with the maintenance of a premium, luxury brand image, often leveraging media attention generated by its high-priced accessories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

## The Mac Pro Wheels: A Case Study

Apple released optional wheels for its Mac Pro computer, priced at $400 if configured with the Mac Pro, or $700 if purchased separately for self-installation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. While the practical need for wheels on a stationary desktop computer is questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>, the wheels themselves are objectively high-quality, made entirely of metal and rubber, and are notably hefty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. They fully articulate 360 degrees and feature independent rubber treads for smooth movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

However, the cost of these wheels is disproportionate to their functional value, especially considering the Mac Pro must be plugged in to operate and the wheels lack brakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. The argument that high tooling costs for low-volume sales necessitates the high price is plausible for some companies, but Apple, with its large revenue, doesn't need to recoup costs on every individual product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.

## Cultivating a Luxury Brand Image

Apple consistently aims to project an image as a premium, [[analysis_of_luxury_branding_and_pricing_strategy_by_apple | luxury brand]] within the tech industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. This strategy is similar to other high-end brands like Supreme, Gucci, Rolex, and Bugatti, which offer products at prices that generate public discussion and recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. Maintaining this perceived image of high quality is crucial and not effortless, especially in a competitive tech landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

A key aspect of this strategy is the psychological effect of price on perceived value. Studies have shown that when consumers are presented with two otherwise identical items, they tend to assume the higher-priced one is of better quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

## Balancing Competitiveness with Premium Pricing

While Apple aims to maintain its luxury status, it also engages in competitive pricing where it benefits their business. Examples include the $329 iPad, which is considered an excellent deal in the tablet market, and the $400 [[impact_of_iphone_pricing_on_the_market | iPhone SE]], known for being highly competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.

However, to reinforce its premium image, Apple also needs high-priced products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. In some categories, such as desktop tower computers, Apple chooses to offer only an expensive version rather than filling market gaps with more affordable options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>.

## Leveraging Media Attention

Apple strategically uses controversial, high-priced items to generate significant media attention, subscribing to the adage "all press is good press" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>. Articles discussing products like the Mac Pro wheels often mention other Apple products, shedding light on the company's offerings and history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>.

Other examples of Apple products that serve a similar purpose include:
*   The $1,000 monitor stand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>
*   The $300 coffee table book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>
*   The $17,000 gold Apple Watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>

While these items are generally not practical purchases for most consumers, their existence makes perfect sense within Apple's broader marketing strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. The more these "crazy" products are discussed, the more attention Apple receives, reinforcing its luxury status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>.

The Rabbit R1 is an AI-powered virtual assistant, presented as an "AI in a box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It shares similarities with the Humane Ai Pin, aiming to distinguish itself through specific features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Current Performance

The Rabbit R1 acts primarily as a virtual assistant capable of answering questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. It sends nearly every request to the Cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a> but feels "significantly quicker to answer questions than the Humane Ai Pin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, consistently demonstrating faster response times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

The device is multimodal, allowing users to ask questions about what its swiveling camera sees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. It can identify plants, summarize long emails, or condense articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

## Significant Limitations

Despite its capabilities, the Rabbit R1 is hindered by several limitations:

### Battery Life
The battery life is "brutally bad," reportedly dying in about four hours even when idle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. It requires multiple charges per day and can be dead by morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. Charging the 1000 mAh battery from zero to full takes 45 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. It lacks fast or wireless charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.

### Missing Basic Features
The device is missing many standard features expected from an assistant, including the ability to set alarms or timers, record videos or photos, send emails, or access a built-in calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.

### AI Accuracy
Like other AI assistants, the Rabbit R1 can "hallucinate" or confidently provide incorrect answers to questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>, which is a common downfall in this category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

### User Interface (UI) and Hardware
The device's [[design_and_features | design]] by Teenage Engineering emphasizes analog controls, notably a scroll wheel for UI navigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. This scroll wheel is "frustrating to use" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a> due to its low sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a> and lack of haptic feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>. There is no back button, forcing users to scroll all the way back up to the top of a menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. Adjusting brightness or volume requires two hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.

The device has a built-in touchscreen, but it is largely underutilized, primarily functioning for typing on a keyboard in "terminal mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.

Regarding [[sound_quality_and_performance | sound quality and performance]], the speaker is described as "very cheap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. Internally, it uses a low-end MediaTek chip, similar to a $150 phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. The screen is a 2.9-inch diagonal TFT display with no auto-brightness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>.

### Large Action Model (LAM) and App Availability
The Rabbit R1 aims to differentiate itself with a "Large Action Model" (LAM), which theoretically allows the AI to use apps like a human would <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>. This is distinct from APIs, as it is supposed to directly interact with app UIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>.

However, the LAM is currently in early stages due to limited training data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>. As of launch, only four apps are available: Spotify, Uber, DoorDash, and Midjourney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>. Even these "kind of work" but have experienced issues like playing the wrong song or making incorrect orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>.

Many promised features are still "in the works":
*   **800 Trained Apps:** Rabbit claims to have 800 apps trained, but they lack a UI and are not yet available on the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>.
*   **Generative UI:** A theoretical feature where the AI could build a UI for an app on the fly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>.
*   **Teach Mode:** This mode would allow the Rabbit to learn tasks by observing a user's mouse and keyboard actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>.

None of these advanced capabilities are currently available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>, leaving the device with only the four partially working apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>.

## Broader Industry Trend
The Rabbit R1 exemplifies a broader trend in tech where companies release "unfinished products" or "half-baked things" that are difficult to review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:00">[14:21:00]</a>. Products are sold with promises of future updates that will eventually deliver the advertised features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>. This issue spans various categories, including gaming, cars, and smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>. AI-based products are considered the "apex of this horrible trend," often being borderline nonfunctional at launch compared to their promised potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:28:00">[15:28:00]</a>.

Consumers pay full price at the beginning, gambling on future improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:45:00">[15:45:00]</a>. While products improving over time is positive, the downside is the delivery of significantly unfinished goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
The idea of a highly personalized AI assistant is exciting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:45:00">[16:45:00]</a>, but achieving it requires significant time, effort, technical development, and vast amounts of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:00">[17:05:00]</a>. The Rabbit R1's low price point of $200 (compared to the Humane Ai Pin's $700 plus subscription) makes it a "much easier investment to make" as a gamble on its future potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:32:00">[17:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:49:00">[17:49:00]</a>.

The device aims to gain a head start by getting into users' hands for beta testing and data collection, similar to how Tesla gathered data for its autopilot systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:00">[18:18:00]</a>. However, unlike Tesla, the Rabbit R1 currently lacks a compelling "other reason" for people to purchase it today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>.

The advice remains to "buy the product based on what it is today, and not what it's promised to be in the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>, which is particularly challenging for this product category given its ambitious promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a>. The impact of larger companies like Google and Apple entering this space is yet to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:31:00">[19:31:00]</a>.

[[ios_15_new_features_overview | iOS 15]] was unveiled at WWDC about a month prior to its general release and is the software running on the iPhone 12 Pro Max, designed for the next iPhone model (likely the 12s or 13) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This version introduces significant updates across various applications and system functionalities.

## Redesigned Stock Applications

Several built-in applications received a fresh look and new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.

### Weather App
The Weather app has been redesigned with a fresh coat of paint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:15">[01:22:15]</a>. It now incorporates information previously found in Dark Sky (which Apple acquired) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:28">[01:18:28]</a>. Key visual enhancements include big, full-screen animations that reflect the current weather conditions, such as sunny or rainy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

### Clock App
The Clock app maintains a similar appearance, but a subtle yet welcome change is the ability to type the time for alarms instead of relying solely on sliders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

### Safari
Safari underwent a more controversial redesign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. The address bar is now located at the bottom of the screen, making it more reachable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. It moves fluidly, disappearing when scrolling to offer a full-screen view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. Users can swipe across the address bar to switch between open tabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>, and it moves back to the top when typing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

### Apple Maps
Apple Maps has received relentless improvements, aiming to catch up with and even surpass competitors like Google Maps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. The new version boasts significantly more detail and incorporates numerous 3D models of buildings and landmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. This increased detail, including modeled trees and buildings, is more prevalent in certain major cities like San Francisco, while others like New York City are still being built out and may not show models at every zoom level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

## [[facetime_updates_in_ios_15 | Facetime Enhancements]]

[[facetime_updates_in_ios_15 | Facetime]] has received a range of tweaks and new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

### Audio and Visual Improvements
*   **Spatial Audio**: In group calls, voices now originate from the direction of the speaker's orientation on the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
*   **Grid View**: A new grid layout allows users to easily see everyone in a group call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.
*   **Portrait Mode**: Users can now blur their background during [[facetime_updates_in_ios_15 | Facetime]] calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.
*   **Microphone Modes**: Options include Standard, Voice Isolation (to cancel background noise), and Wide Spectrum (to keep environmental sound) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

### SharePlay
SharePlay is a significant new feature that allows users to consume media together during a [[facetime_updates_in_ios_15 | Facetime]] call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. It enables synchronized playback of Apple Music, Apple TV shows, and movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. Controls like pausing or fast-forwarding are synced for all participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. SharePlay includes an API, allowing other apps like Disney, HBO, and ESPN to integrate, with hopes for future support from Spotify, Netflix, and YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.

### Facetime Calls as Events
[[facetime_updates_in_ios_15 | Facetime]] calls can now be scheduled as events and added to a calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. Critically, links to [[facetime_updates_in_ios_15 | Facetime]] calls can be shared, allowing users on Windows desktops and Android phones to join, effectively bringing [[facetime_updates_in_ios_15 | Facetime]] to non-Apple platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

## Live Text

Live Text is an on-device feature that allows the iPhone to recognize text within images from the camera or photo gallery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.

### Functionality and Performance
Users can long-press on text in an image to select, copy, or paste it elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>. It also supports translation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. Live Text works well with both printed and written text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. A lookup feature provides suggestions, especially if place or company names are detected, though Siri's intelligence is still somewhat limited in this regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. While it doesn't work for videos, it also works with photos of animals, attempting to identify breeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. This feature approaches the capabilities of Google Lens but is more intuitive, as it's built directly into the photo experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

### Device Compatibility
Live Text is compatible with devices equipped with an A12 Bionic chip or later, meaning older iPhone models will not receive this feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.

## Notifications

While Android's notifications have historically been considered superior, [[ios_15_new_features_overview | iOS 15]] brings key improvements to notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

### Visual Redesign
Notifications feature a new design with larger photo icons and app icons on the left, providing a significant visual difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.

### Notification Summary
A new Notification Summary feature bundles low-priority notifications into one place if the phone hasn't been used for a while, such as overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. This aims to simplify managing a long list of notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.

## [[focus_modes_and_notification_enhancements_in_ios_15 | Focus Modes]]

[[focus_modes_and_notification_enhancements_in_ios_15 | Focus Modes]] is considered the most significant new feature in [[ios_15_new_features_overview | iOS 15]], offering extensive customization similar to separate user profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>.

### Universal Sync and Customization
[[focus_modes_and_notification_enhancements_in_ios_15 | Focus Modes]] sync universally across all Apple devices, including iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, and Mac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>. Users can customize each mode to allow notifications only from specific apps and people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>. Default modes include Do Not Disturb (silences most things), Work (silences fun apps), and Personal (silences work apps), but users can create as many custom modes as desired, such as for the gym, driving, reading, or gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>.

### Automated Modes and Home Screen Integration
[[focus_modes_and_notification_enhancements_in_ios_15 | Focus Modes]] can be set to automatically activate or deactivate based on location or time of day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>. A groundbreaking feature allows users to select specific home screens to appear only when a certain [[focus_modes_and_notification_enhancements_in_ios_15 | Focus Mode]] is active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. For example, a "Work" home screen could exclude distracting social media apps, while a "Home" home screen would display them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>. This cross-device synchronization ensures that activating a [[focus_modes_and_notification_enhancements_in_ios_15 | Focus Mode]] on one device applies to all linked devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.

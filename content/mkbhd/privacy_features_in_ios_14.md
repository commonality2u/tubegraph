[[new_home_screen_features_in_ios_14 | iOS 14]] introduces several enhancements, including notable privacy features designed to inform users when their device's hardware is being accessed by applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

## Camera and Microphone Indicators

A key privacy enhancement in [[new_home_screen_features_in_ios_14 | iOS 14]] is the introduction of visual indicators that alert users to active camera or microphone usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>:

*   **Camera Access Indicator** When an application accesses the camera, a small green light appears on the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. This visual cue lets the user know that the camera is actively in use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Microphone Access Indicator** Similarly, if the microphone is being accessed by an app, a small orange light is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. This provides immediate notification of microphone activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

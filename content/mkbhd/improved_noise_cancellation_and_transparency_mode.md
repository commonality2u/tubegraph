The AirPods Pro 2 introduce significant advancements in both [[noise_cancellation_in_airpods_pro | active noise cancellation]] and transparency mode, largely thanks to the new H2 chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This chip is responsible for audio processing, [[noise_cancellation_in_airpods_pro | noise cancellation]], and other key features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## H2 Chip and Enhanced Performance

The H2 chip, the second generation of Apple's custom audio silicon, enables all the special features of these new AirPods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. It has a high transistor count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a> and is crucial for the improved [[audio_quality_and_h2_chip_advancements | audio quality]] and [[noise_cancellation_and_transparency_mode_features | noise cancellation and transparency mode features]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Active Noise Cancellation Improvements

The AirPods Pro 2 boast much improved [[noise_cancellation_in_airpods_pro | active noise cancellation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Apple states that up to two times more background noise is removed compared to the previous generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Combining the new drivers and [[sound_quality_and_performance | sound profile]] with the enhanced [[noise_cancellation_in_airpods_pro | noise cancellation]] makes the difference definitely noticeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

The [[noise_cancellation_in_airpods_pro | noise cancellation]] is particularly incredible with white noise, such as air conditioners and transportation sounds, which are immediately erased upon putting the headphones on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. This level of performance makes wearing the earbuds on a plane understandable for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

In terms of performance, the [[noise_cancellation_in_airpods_pro | AirPods Pro 2]] are on par with Sony Mark IV earbuds and just below the new Bose Quiet Comfort Earbud 2s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Notably, they surpass the [[display_and_notch_details | AirPods Max]] in their ability to cancel sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. While the [[display_and_notch_details | AirPods Max]] have a much bigger driver and sound different, the AirPods Pro 2 get quieter and remove more background noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

## Adaptive Transparency Mode

A significant advantage of [[noise_cancellation_and_transparency_mode_features | AirPods]] over competitors has been their transparency mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, which was already considered best-in-class for its real-time pass-through of outside sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. With the H2 chip, this feature has "leveled up again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

Apple introduced "Adaptive Transparency Mode," which is an enhancement to the existing transparency mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. It continues to pass through all outside sound but actively cuts down any loud or harsh sounds above 85 dB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

### How Adaptive Transparency Works
For instance, if you're in a city and need to hear cars and people for safety while listening to music, the mode allows this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. If an ambulance drives past with blaring sirens, you will still hear them, but the super loud sound will be suppressed to a level that doesn't hurt your ears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This suppression applies to various loud noises like honking, jackhammers, or barking dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. The system maintains the sound signature of the original noise while reducing its volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

This processing happens in real time with virtually no delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. The AirPods Pro 2 sample outside sound 48,000 times per second, which is 240 times faster than the previous generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This allows them to instantly reduce even sharp, quick sounds like a dog barking, ensuring that by the time the sound reaches your ears, it's at a lower, safer level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

### Practical Application
The adaptive transparency feature is so effective that it could potentially be used at loud concerts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Instead of earplugs, wearing AirPods Pro 2 in transparency mode would allow you to hear the entire sound signature of the concert while reducing the volume to a reasonable level, protecting your hearing without losing the experience of the music, including the bass vibrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

This real-time processing is executed entirely on the earbuds themselves, showcasing the power of the H2 chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

## Related Features

The H2 chip also enables other features:
*   **Noise App Integration** The AirPods Pro 2 can communicate with the Noise app on the Apple Watch in real time, providing a visual representation of how much noise is being canceled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   **Mismatched Earbud Detection** If a user accidentally places someone else's earbud into their case, the case speaker will play a chime, and a "mismatched AirPods" notification will appear on the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

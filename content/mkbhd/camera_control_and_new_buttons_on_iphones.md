Apple's iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro models introduce significant updates to physical controls, notably with the addition of new buttons and a redesigned camera layout for enhanced functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Camera Design Changes
The [[iphone_x_camera_quality_and_features | iPhone X]] and later models featured diagonally oriented cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. However, with the iPhone 16, the cameras are now lined up next to each other, similar to the iPhone 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This change is not merely a retro touch but is specifically implemented to enable the capture of spatial videos and pictures by aligning the sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## New Physical Buttons

The iPhone 16 introduces two new buttons, a notable addition to the device's physical controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Action Button
The iPhone 16 now includes the [[new_action_button_functionality_on_iphone_15_pro | Action button]], a feature previously exclusive to last year's Pro models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This button allows users to set customized shortcuts for various functions, such as activating the flashlight, using Shazam, or triggering a Siri shortcut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Camera Control Button
A second new button, named "Camera Control," has been added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This button is a touch-sensitive cutout covered in sapphire, with a taptic engine positioned behind it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

#### Functionality
Although it is an actual physical button that moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, its vibration motor provides haptic feedback, making a half-press feel like a two-stage button, similar to a camera shutter button on a traditional camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. The "magic" of this area lies in its pressure sensitivity and its function as a tiny trackpad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. It is capacitively sensitive, allowing users to perform swipes and gestures along the phone's corner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

The "Camera Control" button's functions are entirely camera-related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>:
*   **Launch Camera:** Pressing it from the lock screen opens the camera app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Take Photo/Video:** Inside the app, a click takes a photo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>, while a long press starts recording a short video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Access Camera Options:** A half-strength double-tap opens a menu for various camera options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Adjust Settings:** Sliding a finger along the "Camera Control" button allows users to change these options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

While it takes some practice to get used to the hand placement and swiping speed, the feature is designed to be smooth, sensitive, and intuitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

#### Third-Party App Support
Apple has confirmed that third-party camera applications, such as Snapchat, Instagram, and others, will be able to utilize the "Camera Control" slider functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

#### Usability and Placement
The "Camera Control" button is technically impressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Its placement on the bottom right of the phone is convenient for horizontal shooting as a shutter button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. However, its usability in a vertical orientation might be less intuitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This new button is present on both the standard and Pro iPhone 16 models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

#### Software Update Dependency
Despite being a hardware feature, the full two-stage shutter press functionality within the actual camera app will not be available at launch and will require a software update later in the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. This illustrates a separation between hardware upgrades and their corresponding software features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

### Impact on Accessories
The inclusion of the "Camera Control" button means that case manufacturers will need to adapt their designs. Some cases may feature a cutout, while others might attempt to mimic Apple's design with a capacitive glass overlay to maintain a flush surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

## Camera Improvements in Pro Models
The iPhone 16 Pro models feature three new cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>:
*   A new 48-megapixel main camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   A higher-resolution 48-megapixel ultrawide camera, upgraded from the 12-megapixel version of the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   The smaller Pro model now includes a 5x telephoto lens, matching the Pro Max (which previously had 3x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   [[iphone_camera_capabilities_and_features | iPhone camera capabilities and features]] also include faster wireless charging at 25 watts, achieving 50% charge in 30 minutes with a MagSafe charger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   The cameras now support 4K 120 FPS slow motion directly from the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, providing functional files for creative work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

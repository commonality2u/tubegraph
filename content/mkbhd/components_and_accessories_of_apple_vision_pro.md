The [[apple_vision_pro_hardware_and_design | Apple Vision Pro]] is Apple's initial foray into spatial computing, serving as their first AR/VR headset and wearable face computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The base model of the [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_specifications | Vision Pro]] is priced at $3,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, while the 1TB version costs $3,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Core Components

### [[apple_vision_pro_hardware_and_design | Apple Vision Pro]] Headset
The headset itself is relatively small compared to its packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a> and comes with a protective cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. It features an aluminum housing around the outside, with numerous sensors and glass on the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. The device is notably front-weighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a> and feels dense despite its size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Integrated over each ear are small pods containing speaker drivers that point downwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

### Battery
The [[apple_vision_pro_hardware_and_design | Vision Pro]] includes a white, braided cable battery pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a> that uses a proprietary connector to plug into the side of the headset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This battery offers approximately two and a half to three hours of use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a> and has a capacity of 3,166 milliamp hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. It is surprisingly heavy for its capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a> and features a USB-C port for charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

## Included Accessories

### Zeiss Optical Inserts
For users with prescriptions, the [[apple_vision_pro_hardware_and_design | Vision Pro]] comes with Zeiss optical inserts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. These lenses magnetically attach to the headset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, allowing individuals who wear glasses to use the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. They are small and attach with a strong magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. Readers cost $100, while prescription lenses are $150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. After attachment, a code on the lenses can be scanned by the headset to adjust settings for the prescription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

### Head Bands
Two head bands are included to adjust comfort and fit:
*   **Solo Knit Band:** This band, commonly seen in commercials, is made of a soft, stretchy fabric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> and goes around the back of the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. It has a crank for tightening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. With this band, the weight of the headset primarily rests on the cheeks and forehead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **Dual Loop Band:** This band goes both around the back of the head and over the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. It significantly improves weight distribution and comfort for extended wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
Both bands come in different sizes (small, medium, large) tailored to head measurements taken during the purchase process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Bands are easily attached and detached using an orange pull tab that releases a metal click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

### Light Seal Cushions
The [[apple_vision_pro_hardware_and_design | Vision Pro]] includes two Light Seal Cushions: one thin and one thick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. These cushions are custom-fitted based on a face scan performed with an iPhone's Face ID sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. The Light Seal itself is shaped to generally match the user's face to block out light and provide immersion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. The cushions attach magnetically, similar to AirPods Max headphone covers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### Power Accessories
*   **30-watt USB-C Wall Brick:** This power adapter is included for charging the battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **USB-C to USB-C Braided Cable:** A braided cable is provided for charging the battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### Polishing Cloth
A thin microfiber polishing cloth is included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This cloth is different from the ones that come with Apple's monitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a> and is useful for wiping down the glass front of the headset, which is prone to fingerprints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. The cloth has "Vision Pro" written on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

### Documentation
Included paperwork consists of a booklet detailing what's in the box, a first-time setup guide covering iPhone pairing and strap connection, and instructions on how to properly store the cable around the battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## Optional Accessory

### Vision Pro Travel Case
The optional [[apple_vision_pro_features_design | Vision Pro Travel Case]] costs $200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. It features a handle that extends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a> and opens to reveal molded compartments for the headset, battery, and cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. It also includes an accessory pouch for the polishing cloth, power brick, and charging cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. This case is considered practical for protecting the glass exterior of the headset during travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

## Initial Setup

The [[setting_up_the_apple_vision_pro_for_the_first_time | setup process]] involves opening the case, retrieving the battery and headset, choosing a Light Seal Cushion (thin or thick), and selecting a head band (Dual Loop or Solo Knit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. The proprietary cable from the battery connects to the left side of the headset by lining up a dot and twisting until it glows, indicating it is booting up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. The device takes about a minute to boot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. Further details on the [[user_experience_and_interface_of_apple_vision_pro | user experience]] and setup process are covered in subsequent content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

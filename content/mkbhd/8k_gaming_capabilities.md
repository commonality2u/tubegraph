The question of whether one can game in 8K resolution and if there's a desire to do so has resurfaced, particularly with the release of new consoles like the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. While new consoles have shown a significant generational leap, the PC gaming community often asserts that the real [[High Performance Capabilities | power]] still resides with high-end gaming PCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This article explores the current state of [[gaming_performance_in_8k_resolution | 8K gaming performance]] using top-tier PC [[hardware_requirements_for_8k_gaming | hardware]].

## [[Hardware requirements for 8K gaming | Hardware Requirements for 8K Gaming]]

Achieving 8K gaming requires significant computing power. The core of such a setup is a powerful graphics card capable of handling the immense pixel count.

### [[Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 | Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090]]

The [[Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 | Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090]] is presented as the first graphics card to be shown on camera from Nvidia's new 3000 Series, positioned as the highest-end offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This "gigantic huge graphics card" is described as capable of things no new console can match, especially concerning 8K gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### MainGear f131 Custom PC

To complement the [[Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 | RTX 3090]], a custom-built MainGear f131 computer was used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Its specifications include:
*   **CPU**: Intel Core i9 10900K (10 cores, 3.7 GHz base clock, turboing up to 5.3 GHz) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **RAM**: 32 GB of fast HyperX Fury RAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Motherboard**: MSI MPG Z490 Gaming motherboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Storage**: 1 TB Samsung NVMe SSD (970 Pro) as the boot drive and an additional 2 TB SSD for mass storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Chassis**: Custom-built aluminum chassis with RGB lighting, a matte black exterior, and tinted glass side panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### 8K Display Technology

Unlike a previous 8K gaming attempt from three years prior which required two cables to stitch the display together, the [[Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 | RTX 3090]] supports HDMI 2.1 ports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This allows for a single, thicker HDMI cable to output 8K resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. The display used for the test was an 88-inch 8K OLED TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. The desktop resolution was confirmed at 7680x4320 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

However, the world of dedicated 8K gaming monitors is not yet mature, with current options often being expensive TVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

## [[Gaming performance in 8K resolution | Gaming Performance in 8K Resolution]]

Testing was conducted on two different games to assess the [[gaming_performance_in_8k_resolution | 8K gaming performance]].

### Forza Horizon 4

In Forza Horizon 4, the game ran at a locked 60 FPS in 8K during the Autumn setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. While driving, details like leaves on the ground, trees, and sky were much crisper compared to 1440p or 1080p <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The interior of the car and environmental elements, such as individual snowflakes in Winter, showed immense detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. The game's engine displayed intentional details that become more apparent at 8K, contributing to a more immersive experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

The GPU maintained a stable 60 FPS for most of the demo, only dropping to around 50 FPS when a significant amount of action and effects were on screen, indicating a high GPU utilization of 96% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Cutscenes in Forza Horizon 4 often appear to be pre-rendered at lower resolutions (e.g., 1440p or 1080p) before switching back to native 8K gameplay, making the visual fidelity shift very noticeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

### Control Ultimate Edition

Control Ultimate Edition demonstrated the impact of rendering resolution on performance.
*   When the game's actual resolution was set to 8K, but the world's render resolution was set to 5K, the FPS dropped significantly to 21 FPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
*   Reducing the render resolution to 4K resulted in 36 FPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
*   For the best experience, a render resolution of 2K was recommended to maintain higher frames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

This indicates that while the [[Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 | RTX 3090]] is powerful, it is "not invincible" and cannot handle all settings at maximum simultaneously at 8K <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. Despite adjustments, the character and overall game quality remained high, with impressive textures and reflections adding to the immersion, particularly in a horror game where detailed environments enhance the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

## Conclusion

Yes, you *can* game in 8K in 2020, especially with a [[Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 | GeForce RTX 3090]], which can handle most games at this resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. While a powerful GPU is essential, the availability and maturity of 8K gaming monitors are still limited, with high-cost 8K TVs being the primary display option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

A high-end PC setup, like the one tested, provides a spectacular gaming experience at high resolution or high refresh rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. This demonstrates that PCs can achieve levels of fidelity and [[gaming_performance_in_8k_resolution | performance]] that current consoles cannot, with consistent 60 FPS at 8K being a "glorious" and "beautiful" achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. A [[comparison_between_ps5_and_gaming_pcs | significant difference]] exists between console experiences on a 4K TV and the 8K output from a high-end PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

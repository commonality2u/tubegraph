The emergence of folding smartphones has introduced a new frontier of design challenges, particularly evident in early models like the Royole FlexPai, the first and only [[overview_of_folding_smartphones_in_2020 | folding phone to actually ship in 2019]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. While the concept itself is groundbreaking, its implementation reveals significant hurdles in hardware engineering, material science, and user experience.

## Folding Out vs. Folding In Designs

A primary design consideration for folding phones is whether the screen folds inward or outward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The Royole FlexPai utilizes an "outside-folding" design, where the [[folding screen technology | screen]] is on the exterior when folded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This approach has proven to be less ideal than a "folding-in" design like that of the [[Samsung Galaxy Fold design changes | Samsung Galaxy Fold]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Disadvantages of Folding Out

*   **Exposed Screen**: The flexible OLED panel, being the most delicate part, is constantly exposed to the elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Thickness**: Components cannot completely fold flat onto each other, making the device thicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The "fold" is more of a sharp curve than a true flat fold, resulting in a chunky device that struggles to fit in pockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Creases**: Unlike the subtle crease of the [[Samsung Galaxy Fold features and design | Galaxy Fold]], the FlexPai's outward fold results in two noticeable creases on either side of the hinge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Hinge and Durability Concerns

The [[folding phone hinge and durability | hinge]] is a critical component for foldable phones, and the FlexPai's design highlights several challenges:

*   **Vulnerability**: The hinge is explicitly covered in an accordion-shaped rubber, screwed in on the sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. While this rubber might prevent debris from entering the hinge and damaging the screen, it gives the phone an "accordion" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Lack of Smoothness**: The hinge operation is not smooth, often making noises when folded or unfolded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Durability**: There are doubts about the rubber material's ability to withstand repeated folds, sun exposure, scratches, and potential ripping over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Unrated Folds**: Unlike the [[Samsung Galaxy Fold features and design | Galaxy Fold]]'s highly engineered hinge, which claimed 200,000 folds in robot testing (despite its initial issues), the FlexPai doesn't provide such ratings, giving the impression of a less durable "hack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. These durability issues underscored the [[implications of Galaxy Fold failures for foldable phones | challenges for foldable phones]].

## Software and User Experience Hurdles

Beyond the physical design, early folding phones face significant software and usability challenges:

*   **Awkward Handling**: The form factor can be incredibly awkward to handle, especially when folding the screen in half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Button Placement**: Features like split volume buttons (above and below the fingerprint reader/power button) add to the awkwardness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Missing Features**: The absence of a headphone jack is also noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   **Operating System Limitations**: The proprietary Water OS on the FlexPai has limited English translation, lacks Google Play services, and the Play Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Battery Concerns**: An unusual instruction to charge the phone only when unfolded raises questions about battery safety and design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   **Camera Limitations**: The dual camera layout, while allowing for high-quality selfies and a viewfinder for subjects, means there are no cameras on the "back" for taking photos of the environment unless the phone is closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **Auto-Rotate Quirks**: The phone exhibits an unusual auto-rotate behavior where many, but not all, orientations work across its various folded and unfolded states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## Conclusion: The Path Forward

Playing with devices like the FlexPai reinforces two key lessons for [[speculation on future foldable phones | future foldable phones]]:

*   **First Doesn't Mean Best**: Rushing to be first doesn't matter if the product is suboptimal, especially with new technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **[[folding_in_vs_folding_out_designs | Folding In Is Better]]**: As long as [[folding screen technology | screens]] and [[folding phone hinge and durability | hinges]] remain as fragile and less durable as they are currently, the "folding in" design is a more robust and practical approach for [[user perception and future of foldable phones | user adoption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. While "folding out" designs like the Huawei Mate X might appear aesthetically pleasing, they currently pose significant practical challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

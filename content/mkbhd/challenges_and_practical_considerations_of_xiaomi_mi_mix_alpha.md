The [[Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha wraparound display concept | Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha]] is a functional prototype smartphone that aims to demonstrate a unique design concept involving a screen that curves all the way around to the back of the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. As a prototype, it showcases significant [[challenges_of_first_generation_tech | challenges]] and practical considerations inherent in its innovative design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

### Prototype Status and Durability Concerns
The device is a functional prototype, not a consumer-ready phone with a price tag or shipping date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Its design, characterized by an almost entirely visible screen, makes it inherently delicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

A dedicated case for the device is available, but it offers minimal protection, mainly anchoring to the camera strip and providing only slight coverage to the outer edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. The extensive use of glass also means the phone significantly [[Design and materials of Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha | wobbles]] when placed on a flat surface due to its camera stripe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### Physical and Display Limitations
While the [[Design and materials of Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha | phone is heavy]] and dense, feeling like "all screen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>, its design presents specific display flaws:
*   **Gap in Cover Glass**: At the apex where the screen rounds over the sides, there's a noticeable gap in the cover glass. The display is not a single curved piece but rather three pieces that connect, creating a tactile ridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Light Catch and Rainbowing**: From certain angles, the edges of the display catch light, causing a rainbow effect that detracts from the wraparound illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Yellowing at Edges**: The very edges of the display can exhibit a subtle yellow tint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

Furthermore, the extensive screen real estate impacts battery space, potentially limiting the battery size compared to devices with more internal volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

Marketing claims regarding the screen-to-body ratio and diagonal size are also subject to interpretation. While Xiaomi claims a 180.6% screen-to-body ratio, the phone still has visible top and bottom bezels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Similarly, its reported 7.9-inch diagonal screen size is measured around the back, leading to a misleadingly large figure compared to its actual usable front screen size, which is similar to an [[iPhone X design and hardware review | iPhone 11 Pro Max]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Usability and Software Challenges
The [[Innovative features and functionality of Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha | unique design]] introduces several usability hurdles:
*   **Virtual Side Buttons**: The virtual power and volume buttons located on the side of the screen are inconsistent in operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The volume slider, in particular, only works "sometimes" and requires a precise touch while simultaneously rejecting accidental palm touches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. A physical power button is still present at the top of the device, offering a more reliable but less convenient option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Palm Rejection**: The phone relies on a combination of accelerometers, gyroscopes, pressure sensors, and software algorithms to distinguish intentional touches from accidental palm rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This feature is "hit or miss," impressively effective at times but often leading to "tons of accidental presses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Selfie Camera Experience**: The device lacks a dedicated front-facing camera. To take selfies, users must flip the phone over and utilize the main 108-megapixel camera, viewing themselves on the rear display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This approach, while offering higher quality selfies, limits functionality, as the selfie mode does not support features like ultra-wide angles available to the main camera modes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

Overall, the [[Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha wraparound display concept | Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha]] is acknowledged as a "form over function" concept smartphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>, prioritizing its futuristic appearance over seamless practical usability.

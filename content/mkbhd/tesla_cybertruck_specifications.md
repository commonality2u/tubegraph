    *   Still compatible with Tesla V2 and V3 superchargers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>.

## Driving Impressions

The [[first_impressions_and_test_drive_of_the_cybertruck | Cybertruck]] feels like a Tesla, with instant throttle response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>. Its laminated windows contribute to a quiet cabin and are shatterproof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>. The truck is also allegedly bulletproof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>. The suspension is firm but capable of large adjustments between soft and firm settings, thanks to its very rigid, torsionally stiff stainless steel body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>. The steering, while taking getting used to, makes the large truck feel nimble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>.

The most notable strength is its power, with 0-60 mph in 2.7 seconds and 850 horsepower, making it exceptionally fast in a straight line for a truck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. The steering is also a pro, with its tight turning radius and responsive feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>.

Concerns include the polarizing design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:42">[00:38:42]</a> and a higher price than initially anticipated, removing a perceived price advantage over competitors like the [[performance_and_capabilities_of_the_ford_f150_lightning | F-150 Lightning]] and Rivian R1T <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>.

## Update Cycles and Expectations
Unlike the PC world or smartphones, where incremental updates occur annually, new gaming consoles are released only every couple of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This infrequency leads to high expectations for significant generational improvements with each new console launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Value Proposition
While it's considered "heresy" in the gaming console world to compare consoles to PCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, if the [[PlayStation 5 performance and speed | PlayStation 5]] were a gaming PC, it would be:
*   Extremely small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   Pretty inexpensive at $500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   Relevant for the next four straight years, with the potential to improve over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

It would be challenging to find a gaming PC that is as small, cheap, and relevant for such an extended period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This combination presents a "pretty impressive value proposition for a console" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Graphical Prowess
The main reason this comparison doesn't entirely hold up is the superior graphical prowess of a real PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Console quality graphics have historically not matched PC quality graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

For instance, [[gaming_performance_in_8k_resolution | 8K gaming]] on a PC with an RTX 3090 can achieve 60 frames per second with full ray tracing and high-quality graphics settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. This level of performance highlights the difference between a much larger and more expensive PC and the [[PlayStation 5 performance and speed | PlayStation 5]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

## Next-Gen Experience and Longevity
The [[PlayStation 5 performance and speed | PlayStation 5]] is fundamentally a gaming console, performing all the usual functions but with a redesigned, faster, and next-gen user interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

The console is essentially a computer that is guaranteed to have a long life cycle, hopefully improving over time as its game library expands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. This contrasts with the more frequent upgrade cycles common in the PC market.

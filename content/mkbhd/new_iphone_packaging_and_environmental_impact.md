The release of the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro introduced a controversial new unboxing experience for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This change was anticipated by both Apple and the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

## Smaller Packaging
Both the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro now ship in significantly smaller boxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. These new boxes are approximately half the volume and half the height of previous iPhone packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. The iPhone is placed right on top, face down, with its footprint occupying almost the entire box with some padding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. This new smaller box size is expected to become standard for other iPhone models as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. The iPhone 12 Pro comes in an all-black box with blue accents for the Pacific Blue model, aligning with the dark themes of Pro phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

## Contents of the Box
The contents of the new, smaller iPhone boxes are minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>:
*   The iPhone itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>
*   A USB-C to Lightning cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>
*   Paperwork, which is now in a half-sized pamphlet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>
*   A SIM card removal tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>
*   A single white sticker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>

Notably, the box no longer includes a wall charging brick or headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. The [[contents_of_the_iphone_7_retail_box | contents]] for the iPhone 12 Pro box are exactly the same as the iPhone 12, without special colored stickers or Product (RED) sheets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

## Environmental Justification and Controversy
Apple's primary defense for removing the charging brick from the box is an [[environmental_impact_and_packaging_changes | environmental benefit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. The company argues that this change reduces the need to ship chargers and materials that would otherwise end up in landfills, as many people already own charging bricks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

However, a point of contention arises because the included cable is USB-C to Lightning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>, while the traditional wall bricks that most users already possess are USB-A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. This means that only those who previously purchased an iPhone 11 Pro (which shipped with a USB-C brick) or other USB-C enabled devices would have a compatible wall brick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. Consequently, many iPhone 12 buyers with only USB-A wall bricks will still need to purchase a new USB-C wall brick, which Apple conveniently sells separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

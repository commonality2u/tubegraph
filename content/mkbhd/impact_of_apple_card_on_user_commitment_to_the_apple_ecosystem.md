The [[Apple Card]] is essentially a credit card designed for [[apple_card_integration_with_iphone_and_wallet_app | iPhone]] users, functioning as an extension of [[apple_card_integration_with_iphone_and_wallet_app | Apple Pay]] in physical credit card form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. Its deep integration with the [[apple_card_integration_with_iphone_and_wallet_app | Wallet app]] on the [[apple_card_integration_with_iphone_and_wallet_app | iPhone]] creates a significant tool for user lock-in within the Apple ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

## Deep Integration with iOS

The [[Apple Card]] is inextricably linked to the [[apple_card_integration_with_iphone_and_wallet_app | iPhone]] and its software:
*   **Activation** The card activates by simply touching the [[Apple Card]] to the top of an [[apple_card_integration_with_iphone_and_wallet_app | iPhone]], appearing in iOS just like pairing AirPods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This process adds the card to the [[apple_card_integration_with_iphone_and_wallet_app | Wallet app]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.
*   **Wallet App Features** The [[apple_card_integration_with_iphone_and_wallet_app | Wallet app]] provides numerous features for card management, including an intuitive UI for viewing interest payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. A unique visual gradient in the app changes color based on spending categories, with purchases populating instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. Users can also view a detailed purchase history, including transaction locations on a map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.
*   **[[security_features_of_apple_card | Security Features]]** All [[Apple Card]] activity within the app is [[security_features_of_apple_card | secured with Face ID]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. The card can be remotely deactivated from the [[apple_card_integration_with_iphone_and_wallet_app | Wallet app]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>, which is also where the card number for online purchases can be accessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. The physical card itself has no card number or signature for enhanced [[security_features_of_apple_card | security]] and a clean aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

## Reinforcing the Apple Ecosystem

The seamless and beneficial integration of the [[Apple Card]] with the [[apple_card_integration_with_iphone_and_wallet_app | iPhone]] and [[apple_card_integration_with_iphone_and_wallet_app | Wallet app]] is perceived as a deliberate strategy to further entrench users within Apple's "walled garden" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

Previous factors, such as iMessage and iCloud storage, already contribute to users' reluctance to switch away from the [[apple_card_integration_with_iphone_and_wallet_app | iPhone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. The [[Apple Card]] adds another layer of commitment, making it more challenging for users to transition to an Android phone if it means giving up their credit card and its integrated features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. This positions the [[Apple Card]] as "another tool that can be used to sort of trap you in the Apple ecosystem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>.

The [[Display and design of the iPhone X | iPhone X]] is described as the reviewer's favorite iPhone by far, and an iconic device in iPhone history, feeling more modern and new compared to its predecessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Design and Build
Unlike previous iPhones that largely featured a home button, rectangle screen, and rounded corners, the [[Display and design of the iPhone X | iPhone X]] introduced fundamental changes to how the phone is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. While maintaining the familiar rectangle with rounded corners, it's the first iPhone where the display itself has curved corners and is pushed closer to the edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This design helps the iPhone catch up with 2017 phone trends of smaller bezels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

The [[Display and design of the iPhone X | iPhone X]] feels great to hold and is an "awesome size," though the reviewer would prefer a larger "iPhone X Plus" if available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Despite its larger display, it feels closer in size to the [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 8]] than the [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 8 Plus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The stainless steel sides contribute to a slippery feel, making it prone to sliding out of pockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. The shiny silver finish, unlike the matte finish of previous iPhones, is not expected to last without chipping or scratching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Hardware Features
The [[Display and design of the iPhone X | iPhone X]] offers a complete hardware package, as expected from a premium smartphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Speakers** are noted as "pretty good," despite not being front-facing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   It is **water resistant**, providing peace of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Wireless charging** is supported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   There is **no headphone jack**, a common feature in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   With glass on both the front and back, the [[Display and design of the iPhone X | iPhone X]] is considered the most breakable iPhone ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Camera Bump
A significant hardware dislike is the camera bump, not just for the common issue of the phone rocking on a table, but due to its new vertical orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This orientation can lead to accidentally getting a finger in photos or videos because of its placement in the corner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## The Notch
The signature feature on the front of the [[Display and design of the iPhone X | iPhone X]] is the notch at the top of the display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: The notch houses all the front-facing sensors, cameras, an IR blaster, and depth sensor, which are necessary when shrinking bezels in 2017 phone design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **User Experience**: While some hate it, the reviewer generally doesn't notice it in everyday use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. It becomes part of the phone's "character" and disappears quickly during normal activities like scrolling through apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Software Adoption**: Apple's strategy is to "embrace the notch," promoting apps that wrap around it and fill the entire display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This requires developers to update their apps for the taller aspect ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Many major apps have already updated, while un-updated apps will show large bezels at the top and bottom, resembling an [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 8]] display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Video Playback**: The only time the notch is consistently noticeable is when watching full-screen videos, as it cuts off part of the display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Users can double-tap to scale the video down, adding bezels and making the video appear smaller, similar to an [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 8]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## Display
The [[Display and design of the iPhone X | iPhone X]] features a "Super Retina Display," which is Apple's first OLED panel in a smartphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   It's a 5.8-inch panel with high pixel density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   It supports the P3 color gamut and HDR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   It includes True Tone technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
*   While not as bright or saturated as Samsung's Note 8 or S8 displays, it is still bright enough and avoids overly cartoonish colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   It exhibits a small blue shift when tilted off-axis, similar to other OLEDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **3D Touch** is still present, though the reviewer rarely uses it outside of lock screen controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## New Interaction: Gestures and Face ID
The removal of the home button on the [[Display and design of the iPhone X | iPhone X]] led to the implementation of a new gesture-based navigation system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This is described as the biggest learning curve for any iPhone but is "not that bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Home**: Swipe up from the bottom bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **Notifications**: Swipe down from the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Control Center**: Swipe down from the right corner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Multitasking**: Swipe halfway up and then over to access recent apps. A "pro tip" is to swipe up and over quickly to get to the app cards faster, rather than swiping up and waiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Reachability**: Still available in accessibility settings, allowing a swipe down on the bottom of the screen to bring the top corners within reach for one-handed use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

### Face ID
Replacing the fingerprint reader (Touch ID), Face ID is the facial recognition system on the [[Display and design of the iPhone X | iPhone X]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **Performance**: It works "really well most of the time" but isn't as perfect as Touch ID in terms of fail rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Touch ID is faster, but Face ID can improve with software updates and wider usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Mechanism**: Face ID works by bouncing thousands of infrared dots off the user's face to create a 3D map of eyes, nose, and mouth, not using the front-facing camera for recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Adaptability**: It can learn a changing face over time, recognizing users after haircuts, beard shaves, or makeup application, as these don't significantly affect the dot map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. It cannot be tricked by a picture due to the lack of depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. It also works through some sunglasses where infrared light can pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   **Limitations**: Face ID can fail when backlit or when there's excessive infrared light (e.g., from direct sunlight), requiring a passcode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. The success rate is estimated at 95% compared to Touch ID's 99% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   **Attention Aware**: There's a setting to require user attention, meaning the phone won't unlock or show notification data unless the user is looking at it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   **Seamless Authentication**: Face ID is seen as a step towards more secure, seamless authentication, where the phone unlocks automatically as it's picked up, allowing immediate use for logging in, payments, and app downloads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

### Animoji
Animoji is described as a "fun feature" exclusive to the [[Display and design of the iPhone X | iPhone X]], allowing users to send moving, facial-tracking emoji <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Sending an Animoji indicates the sender has an [[Display and design of the iPhone X | iPhone X]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. It is noted that Animoji primarily uses the front-facing camera and still works even when depth sensors are covered, suggesting it could have been made available on other iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

## Cameras
The [[Display and design of the iPhone X | iPhone X]] features "slightly new cameras" with the same sensors as the [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 8 Plus]], but with slightly better glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Both cameras are now optically stabilized, leading to meaningfully better performance with the 2x telephoto lens for zoomed-in photos and videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **Photo Quality**: Photos look "awesome" with improved dynamic range and more aggressive HDR, resulting in vibrant skies and tight color accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. It's considered a "top five smartphone camera," though not as good as the Pixel 2's camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.
*   **Front-facing Camera**: It might be the best front-facing camera for video on any smartphone, despite a tendency to overexpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   **Portrait Mode (Front-facing)**: Portrait selfies are available, but the edge blurring is not as good as on the Pixel 2 or the [[Display and design of the iPhone X | iPhone X]]'s rear camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Improvements are expected via software updates due to the potential of machine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.

## Performance and Battery
The [[Display and design of the iPhone X | iPhone X]] is powered by the A11 Bionic chip and 3GB of RAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. This chipset is considered the most powerful mobile chipset in any smartphone at the time of review, with "insane" benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. This power is primarily utilized for features like augmented reality apps, image processing, and super slow-motion video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

### iOS
iOS on the [[Display and design of the iPhone X | iPhone X]] feels more modern due to the new swiping and gestures, but its core functionality remains familiar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. Quarks like the disorganized notification system (which doesn't group apps) persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

### Battery Life
Battery life on the [[Display and design of the iPhone X | iPhone X]] is "pretty great," comparable to the [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 8 Plus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. It handles the largest iPhone display well, largely due to it being an OLED panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. The reviewer consistently gets to the end of a single day with full use, typically achieving around six hours of screen-on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

## Conclusion
The [[Display and design of the iPhone X | iPhone X]] is highly favored by the reviewer, who considers it their "favorite iPhone ever by far" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. While costing a thousand dollars, it's believed that users who purchase it will not be disappointed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
*   **Downsides**: The all-glass back makes it more breakable, the notch is a negative for some, and the lack of a headphone jack remains a drawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
*   **Overall**: These downsides are considered things that buyers in 2017 are already accustomed to or expect, making them not deal-breakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. The reviewer is "happy to be carrying this phone" and recommends it to those considering a purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

The LG G Flex is notable for its durability, particularly its [[lg_g_flex_selfhealing_technology | self-healing]] back and its flexible design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. These features gained significant attention after a semi-viral video from LG's official YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Self-Healing Backing
One aspect of the LG G Flex's durability is its unique backing material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### LG's Official Demonstration
LG's official video showcased the phone's ability to heal scratches on its back within two minutes, unlike a regular phone that remained scratched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The back of the phone is described as very smooth, similar to the [[material_design_of_lg_g_flex | Galaxy S4]], making scratches easily detectable by touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. However, LG's demonstration used a bronze brush with "super even strokes," leading to questions about its applicability to real-life scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Real-World Testing
In a more practical test, the phone was deliberately scuffed with keys, simulating common pocket wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. After a few minutes, the scratches were mostly minimized, though not completely gone, making them "definitely way less noticeable" than when fresh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This feature could be particularly useful if the phone is dropped, as scratches might become barely noticeable after some time in a pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Healing Conditions
The [[lg_g_flex_selfhealing_technology | self-healing]] process is influenced by temperature. LG's official video, an advertisement, was conducted under "optimal controlled conditions," specifically at an air temperature of 27.4 degrees Celsius (81 degrees Fahrenheit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. In colder conditions, such as 13 degrees Celsius (55 degrees Fahrenheit), the healing process can be slower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. However, warming up the device, by methods like rubbing it fast, clutching it to the body, or playing intensive games, can accelerate the healing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

Even deep scratches, like those made by a knife, show significant improvement. A knife scratch made across the back of the device was "about halfway gone" and "barely noticeable" after a few hours and attempts to warm the device, which is still impressive compared to traditional phone materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## Flexible Design
The second key aspect of the LG G Flex's durability is its [[flexibility_and_structure_of_lg_g_flex | curved design]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The phone can be completely flattened from its curved shape without internal damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Despite housing a large 3500 mAh battery, a six-inch display, and all standard phone components, it withstands flexing as demonstrated in LG's advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This level of resiliency is uncommon, especially among other curved phones like the Samsung Galaxy Round, which is merely rounded and does not flex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

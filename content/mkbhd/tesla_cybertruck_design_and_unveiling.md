The Tesla CyberTruck event in California was highly anticipated, as the vehicle was one of the few pieces of tech that did not leak in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. The presenter attended the event to give his [[First impressions and test drive of the CyberTruck | first impressions]] of an electric pickup truck, despite not being a regular pickup truck user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.

## The Unveiling Event

The unveiling event was described as "pretty wild" and the "most showy Tesla event in a while" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. It featured props, lasers, and a large crowd of excited people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. After Elon Musk's introduction, the [[Tesla CyberTruck design and features | Tesla CyberTruck]] quickly rolled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

## Design and Exterior Features

The initial reaction to the CyberTruck's appearance was one of shock, as its shape and look were completely unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. It was likened to a "low poly count render" of a pickup truck from a video game or a "fan-made render" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. There is "not a whole lot of anything else like it out on the road" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

Key design elements and features include:
*   **Size** The truck is "really striking" and "huge," described as "massive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.
*   **Exoskeleton** The [[Tesla CyberTruck design and features | Tesla CyberTruck]] features a stainless steel exoskeleton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. During a demo, Franz was able to hit it with a sledgehammer without causing dents, suggesting the body is "essentially bulletproof" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.
*   **Windows** There were "bold claims" about the toughness of the windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. A heavy metal ball dropped onto a sheet of the glass did not shatter it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. However, when the same ball was "lightly" tossed at the prototype truck, the glass broke both times, though it did not completely make it through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. This suggested that either the prototype lacked the super tough glass or more work was needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.
*   **Shape** The truck features stark angles instead of curves, with the cabin appearing like a "damn triangle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.
*   **Lighting** It has distinctive bar headlights, a roof bar headlight, and a bar tail light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.
*   **Wheels** The wheels are described as "crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.

The [[Tesla CyberTruck design and features | CyberTruck]] shares "pretty much no DNA from any other Tesla model" except for possibly the door handles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>.

## Interior Design

During a test ride, the interior felt "very bare prototype feeling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.
*   **Steering Wheel** It features another "yolk steering wheel," similar to the 2020 Roadster prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.
*   **Touchscreen** The touchscreen is "basically the same" as a Model 3 but with new graphics specific to the CyberTruck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.
*   **Space and Seating** The interior offers "tons of glass," "tons of space," "lots of headroom and foot room" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. Passengers are "really high off the ground," requiring a "hiking up" motion to enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. The vehicle is a six-seater, with three seats in the front row and three in the back, both being benches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
*   **Rear View Mirror** The rear view mirror is a display that shows the rear-facing camera feed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.
*   **Surface Areas** There is a "marble countertop-like blank surface area in the front," which struck the observer as "very strange" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.

## Initial Reactions and Polarization

The [[Tesla CyberTruck design and features | CyberTruck's]] design is highly "unconventional" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. As one tech YouTuber noted, "at least we're not bored" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. Tesla could have opted for a "super cookie cutter design" or simply morphed an existing Tesla design into a pickup truck, like cutting the back off a Model Y <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. However, the CyberTruck's design rethinks everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.

The design is considered "one of the most polarizing automotive designs" ever seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>. To someone who is "not a truck person," it seems "super badass" and reminiscent of a "Mars rover" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>. Public opinion appears to be sharply divided, with people either "really like it or really hate it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.

## Questions and Unknowns

Many questions remained unanswered at the unveiling event:
*   **Release Date** There was no specific release date given, despite pre-orders and reservations being open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.
*   **Windshield Wipers** The location of the windshield wipers was not clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.
*   **Sideview Mirrors** The sideview mirrors were not present or explained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.
*   **Bed Material** The material of the truck bed was not specified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.
*   **ATV Availability** An ATV was brought out and fit into the back of the CyberTruck, where it could be charged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. It was unclear if this ATV would be sold, its price, or if it would be an option with the truck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>. The ATV seemed to act like a spoiler, making the truck "look better with the ATV in the back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.

It is expected that more details will "creep out" as the vehicle gets closer to production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.

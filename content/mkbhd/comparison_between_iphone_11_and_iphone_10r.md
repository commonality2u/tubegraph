The [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 11]] is presented as a significant improvement over the [[comparison_between_iphone_xr_and_iphone_xs | iPhone 10R]] in several key areas, while retaining many familiar design elements. It is positioned as the new default iPhone recommended for most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Key Similarities

*   **Form Factor:** It shares the same shape, notch, and size as the [[comparison_between_iphone_xr_and_iphone_xs | iPhone 10R]], making it a fairly big phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Physical Features:** The [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 11]] retains the same mute switch, speakers, aluminum rails, lightning port, and buttons as its predecessor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Display:** It features the same LCD display with a resolution of 1792 by 828, which means it cannot natively watch HD YouTube videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The YouTube app may show 1080p options, but the actual resolution is closer to 720p <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## New Features and Improvements in [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 11]]

### Naming Convention
The most immediate change is the name itself; it's simply called [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 11]], signaling a move away from Roman numerals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Colors and Design
The [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 11]] introduces six new colors: black, green, yellow, purple, red, and white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. These colors are described as more pastel, with the Product Red being lighter than last year's version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The [[comparison_between_iphone_xr_and_iphone_xs | iPhone 10R]]'s blue and coral colors are no longer available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

A notable design change is the back glass finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>:
*   The main back of the phone, where the Apple logo is now centrally located, has a normal glossy finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   The camera square features a matte glass finish, which is the opposite of the [[comparison_of_iphone_11_pro_to_previous_models | iPhone 11 Pro]]'s design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   Both finishes are cut from a single piece of glass, milled down to create the distinct shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Battery Life
The [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 11]] boasts a battery life that is approximately one hour longer than the [[comparison_between_iphone_xr_and_iphone_xs | iPhone 10R]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This improvement is partly due to the more efficient A13 Bionic chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The [[comparison_between_iphone_xr_and_iphone_xs | iPhone 10R]] was already noted for having excellent battery life for an iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Cameras
The camera system is the most significant upgrade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>:
*   **Dual Cameras:** The [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 11]] adds a second, ultra-wide camera to the new main camera, offering dual camera capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Video Features:** Users can now switch between lenses while recording video, with both the regular and ultra-wide cameras supporting 4K video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Improved Portrait Mode:** Portrait mode no longer requires detecting human faces; it can now apply fake shallow depth of field to animals, objects, and other subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Front-Facing Camera:** A new, wider front-facing camera is included, capable of taking slow-motion selfie videos, dubbed "slofies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Missing Feature:** The [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 11]] does not include the third telephoto camera found on the [[comparison_of_iphone_11_pro_to_previous_models | iPhone 11 Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **Quality:** Both included cameras are considered excellent, earning an A+ rating for smartphone cameras in 2019. It is arguably the best camera in a $700 smartphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### Processor
The [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 11]] features a more efficient A13 Bionic chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Pricing
The [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 11]] starts at $700 for the 64GB model, which is a price drop compared to previous "pro" models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This pricing fits within Apple's current iPhone lineup, which still includes the [[comparison_between_iphone_xr_and_iphone_xs | iPhone 10R]] at a cheaper price and the [[differences_between_iphone_x_and_iphone_8 | iPhone 8]] for even less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Recommendations for Buyers

The [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 11]] is generally recommended as the iPhone most people should get <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. However, there are a few considerations:

### Screen Quality
The display remains the biggest weakness of the [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 11]], as it is an LCD with a resolution just over 720p <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   If you highly value a sharp, high-resolution display and notice the difference when looking at the [[comparison_between_iphone_xr_and_iphone_xs | iPhone 10R]] or [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 11]] screen, consider upgrading to an OLED iPhone like the [[comparison_between_iphone_xr_and_iphone_xs | iPhone 10S]] or [[comparison_of_iphone_11_pro_to_previous_models | iPhone 11 Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

### Size
The [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 11]] has a 6.1-inch screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   If this size feels too large, the [[comparison_of_iphone_11_pro_to_previous_models | iPhone 11 Pro]] offers a slightly smaller form factor with a better display, though at a higher cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   If the size is not big enough, the [[comparison_of_iphone_11_pro_to_previous_models | iPhone 11 Pro Max]] is an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

### Budget and Alternatives
While the [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 11]] is cheaper than its "Pro" counterparts, budget is always a factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   Apple continues to sell the [[comparison_between_iphone_xr_and_iphone_xs | iPhone 10R]] at $600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. It remains a competitive option if the advanced camera features (second camera, camera upgrades) of the [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 11]] are not a priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   The [[differences_between_iphone_x_and_iphone_8 | iPhone 8]] is also still available at an even lower price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Conclusion
> The [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 11]] is largely an [[comparison_between_iphone_xr_and_iphone_xs | iPhone 10R]] with a slightly new design, enhanced cameras (including an extra lens), improved battery life, and a new A13 Bionic chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. These improvements, combined with a price drop and a simplified name, make it an easy and highly recommended iPhone for most new buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

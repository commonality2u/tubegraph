The iPhone 6s introduces significant internal upgrades, particularly focusing on speed and performance. Historically, the "S" in iPhone models has stood for "speed," a trend that continues with the iPhone 6s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## A9 Chip and RAM

The iPhone 6s is equipped with Apple's new A9 chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This is a dual-core chip with two very powerful cores, operating at nearly two gigahertz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Complementing the powerful processor, the phone also features two gigabytes of RAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, which is described as plenty for iOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### Impact on Multitasking and App Performance
The increased RAM significantly enhances multitasking capabilities, allowing the phone to keep more apps in memory for longer periods than previous models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Overall Performance

The combination of the A9 chip and 2GB RAM results in a device that is "insanely fast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
Key performance aspects include:
*   **Snappy Day-to-Day Use**: Overall day-to-day performance is super snappy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **High Frame Rates**: Frame rates are consistently high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   **Fast App Management**: Apps open and close very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, and performance throughout is top-notch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Benchmark Scores**: The iPhone 6s achieves impressive scores in Geekbench, putting it on par with some laptops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This highlights its "blazing" speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

The fast performance is not just a characteristic of a brand new phone; it maintains its speed even after weeks of use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Charging Ports and Adapters
The new MacBook Pros mark a return of several ports, including the magnetic MagSafe charging port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This new MagSafe design is thinner and stronger than previous versions, with increased lateral strength, making it easier to detach at an angle while still feeling secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

The 14-inch MacBook Pro comes with a 96-watt power adapter, which is an upgrade from the 67-watt adapter of the base model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The 16-inch MacBook Pro includes a "huge" rectangular 140-watt charging brick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. A notable design choice is that the brick is separate from the braided USB-C cable, which connects to the MagSafe port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. However, the space gray laptop does not come with a matching space gray MagSafe connector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Charging Speed
The 140 watts delivered by the larger power adapter is a significant amount of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Users can fast charge these laptops via MagSafe, achieving about half a charge in half an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. For those who prefer a single charger, the laptops can also be charged via USB-C, which provides about 96 watts, still offering good charging speed though not as fast as MagSafe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Battery Performance
The new MacBook Pros are noted for their high performance combined with incredible efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.
When performing demanding tasks, such as exporting a video project, the M1 Max MacBook Pro did not lose any performance while on [[battery_life_and_charging_capabilities | battery]] power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. During an export, the [[battery_life_and_charging_capabilities | battery]] only dropped 2% (from 96% to 94%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

The 16-inch MacBook Pro offers different performance profiles. While typically left on "automatic," switching to "high power mode" (exclusive to the 16-inch) for tasks like exporting resulted in even faster completion times (3 minutes and 49 seconds for a video export), without the fans being audibly noticeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

Regarding overall [[battery_life_and_charging_capabilities | battery life]]:
*   The 16-inch model, equipped with a 100 watt-hour [[battery_life_and_charging_capabilities | battery]], generally lasts longer than the 14-inch model, which has a 70 watt-hour [[battery_life_and_charging_capabilities | battery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.
*   The M1 Pro chip is more efficient than the M1 Max, meaning M1 Pro models tend to have longer [[battery_life_and_charging_capabilities | battery life]] because the M1 Max's GPU cores run hotter and consume more power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.
*   The 16-inch M1 Pro configuration offers the longest possible [[battery_life_and_charging_capabilities | battery life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.
*   Overall, both models achieve similar "all-day, best-in-class" [[battery_life_and_charging_capabilities | battery life]] comparable to the original M1 MacBook Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.
*   However, intense workloads like editing video in high power mode while on [[battery_life_and_charging_capabilities | battery]] can deplete it in about four hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>. The fast charging capability helps mitigate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.
*   Upgrading to the M1 Max chip, while more powerful, will slightly reduce [[battery_life_and_charging_capabilities | battery life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>.

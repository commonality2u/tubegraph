The [[tesla_cybertruck_design_and_unveiling|unveiling event]] for the [[tesla_cybertruck_design_and_features|Tesla CyberTruck]] showcased impressive specifications, which the presenter noted as potentially "the most impressive part of the truck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Performance Statistics

The CyberTruck is offered in multiple configurations, each with distinct performance capabilities:

*   **Single Motor Rear-Wheel Drive**
    *   Starting price: $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>
    *   0 to 60 mph: 6.5 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>
*   **Triple Motor All-Wheel Drive**
    *   0 to 60 mph: 2.9 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>
    *   Range: 500+ miles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>
    *   Towing Capacity: 14,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>
        *   For reference, the 2024 [[performance_and_capabilities_of_the_ford_f150_lightning|Ford F-150]] can tow about half of this capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

All models feature adaptive suspension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Body and Materials

The [[tesla_cybertruck_design_and_features|CyberTruck]] boasts a stainless steel exoskeleton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. A demonstration showed the exoskeleton being hit with a sledgehammer without denting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, suggesting the body is essentially bulletproof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

However, a demo of the "Armor Glass" windows had mixed results. While a metal ball dropped from a height didn't shatter a sheet of the glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, the same ball "lightly" tossed at the actual prototype truck's windows resulted in both breaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Although the ball did not completely penetrate, it suggested that either the prototype lacked the super tough glass or more development was needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Interior Features and Ride Experience

During [[first_impressions_and_test_drive_of_the_cybertruck|a quick test ride]], the interior of the prototype was described as having a "very bare prototype feeling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Key interior features include:
*   A yolk steering wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, similar to the 2020 Roadster prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   A touchscreen interface "basically the same" as a [[comparison_to_other_tesla_models_and_conventional_pickup_trucks|Model 3]] but with new graphics specific to the CyberTruck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   Ample glass, offering an open feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   Significant headroom and foot room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   A high ride height, requiring effort to get into the vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   The rearview mirror functions as a display for the rear-facing camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   A six-seater configuration, with three seats in the front row and three in the back, both featuring bench seating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   A "marble countertop like blank surface area" in the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

An acceleration test in a dual motor variant showed the truck "clearly hauls" and is "gonna be really fast for a pickup truck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

MHD provides an overview of Apple's September event held in Cupertino, California, focusing on the new [[iphone_14_design_and_pricing | iPhone 14 lineup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The event also introduced new AirPods and Apple Watch models, including the Apple Watch Ultra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

The [[iphone_14_design_and_pricing | iPhone 14 lineup]] for 2022 includes the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone 14 Pro Max <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The iPhone mini line has been discontinued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus

The baseline iPhone 14 models maintain a similar aesthetic to the [[iphone_13_lineup_and_features | iPhone 13 lineup]] with some subtle refinements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Design and Pricing
*   **Sizes**: The iPhone 14 features a 6.1-inch display, while the new iPhone 14 Plus offers a larger 6.7-inch display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Pricing**: Prices remained consistent with predictions, with the iPhone 14 starting at $799 and the iPhone 14 Plus at $899 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Chip**: Both models retain the A15 Bionic chip from the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Aesthetics**: The design and notch remain similar to the [[iphone_13_lineup_and_features | iPhone 13]], suggesting that [[iphone_13_lineup_and_features | iPhone 13]] cases might fit the iPhone 14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The green color option has been removed, and a new light blue color is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### New Features
Three primary areas of improvement for these models are the display, cameras, and connectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

*   **Connectivity**:
    *   **eSIM**: In the U.S., the [[iphone_14_design_and_pricing | iPhone 14 lineup]] no longer includes a physical SIM card tray, moving entirely to eSIM (electronic SIM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
    *   **Satellite Connectivity for SOS**: A significant new feature is satellite connectivity for emergency SOS in areas without cellular service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. The [[iphone_14_design_and_pricing | iPhone 14]]'s antennas are designed to communicate with satellites, and the UI helps users point the phone directly at a satellite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Emergency messages can be sent in 30 seconds to two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This feature will launch later this year in the U.S. and Canada and will be free for two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Display**: The displays retain the same sizes and resolutions but are now brighter, reaching 1200 nits maximum for HDR content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Camera System**:
    *   **Main Camera**: A larger 12-megapixel main sensor with sensor-shift stabilization and a wider f/1.5 aperture is included for improved low-light performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
    *   **Selfie Camera**: A new 12-megapixel front-facing camera now includes autofocus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
    *   **Photonic Engine**: Apple introduced a "Photonic Engine," which is an enhanced image processing pipeline designed to improve low-light sensitivity and nighttime photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
    *   **Action Mode**: A new Action Mode feature provides dramatic stabilization for shaky videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### Overall Impression
The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus are effectively similar to an [[comparison_of_iphone_14_pro_with_previous_models | iPhone 13 Pro]], lacking only the telephoto camera and ProMotion OLED display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. The iPhone 14 Plus is expected to offer the best battery life ever in an iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. The iPhone 14 Plus will be available a month later in October <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

## iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max

The [[iphone_14_pro_features_and_innovations | iPhone 14 Pro]] and Pro Max models share the satellite connectivity and Action Mode features of the base models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a> and maintain the same 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch display sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### Key New Features
*   **A16 Bionic Chip**: These Pro models are equipped with the new A16 Bionic chip, a more powerful and efficient six-core chip built on a 4-nanometer process, quoted as being 40% better than the competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   **Display Upgrades**: The Pro displays boast up to 2,000 nits peak brightness outdoors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. They also finally introduce an always-on display, allowing users to see the time, notifications, and widget info when the phone is locked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   [[iphone_14_pro_camera_enhancements | Camera Enhancements]]: The camera system is entirely new and physically larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
    *   **48-Megapixel Main Sensor**: For the first time in a decade, iPhones receive a megapixel bump with a new 48-megapixel main camera sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. It typically bins down to 12 megapixels for standard shots but can capture 48-megapixel photos when shooting in ProRAW format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
    *   **2x Telephoto Option**: A new 2x button in the camera UI uses an exact crop of the middle 12 megapixels of the sensor, providing optical quality zoom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. The 3x telephoto lens is still present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Island**: This feature transforms the pill-shaped cutout at the top of the screen (housing the selfie camera and Face ID components) into an interactive UI element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
    *   **Functionality**: It dynamically expands and contracts with animations to display ongoing notifications and live activities such as music playback, timers, or ride-share updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Users can tap to open the associated app or long-press to surface additional information, similar to a widget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
    *   **Multitasking**: The Dynamic Island can adapt to show multiple background activities, essentially acting as a mini-multitasking UI to switch between ongoing tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
    *   **Usability**: It is intuitive and responsive, even when tapping near the non-pixelated camera cutout itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. While the cutout might be noticeable during full-screen videos or games, its utility is expected to outweigh this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
    *   **Third-Party Support**: It will also work with third-party applications, pending developer implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

### Pricing and Color
*   **Pricing**: The [[iphone_14_pro_features_and_innovations | iPhone 14 Pro]] starts at $999 and the Pro Max at $1099, with storage options up to 1TB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.
*   **Color**: A new dull lavender-type purple color is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

## Older Models Still Available

Apple continues to offer the [[iphone_13_lineup_and_features | iPhone 13 mini]] and [[iphone_13_lineup_and_features | iPhone 13]] in its lineup, priced at $599 and $699 respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

## Accessories

As with previous models, the [[overview_of_iphone_models_from_1_to_13 | iPhone 14]] models do not include a charger in their boxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Third-party options like the Anker Nano 3 (a 30W charger 70% smaller than Apple's) and the Anker 541 bio-based cable are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

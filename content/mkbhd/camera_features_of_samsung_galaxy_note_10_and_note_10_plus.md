Samsung unveiled the [[samsung_galaxy_note_10_and_note_10_plus_design_and_build | Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10 Plus]] phones, highlighting their camera capabilities as a "pro photo and video tool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## Rear Camera Setup
Both the [[samsung_galaxy_note_10_and_note_10_plus_design_and_build | Galaxy Note 10]] and Note 10 Plus feature a triple-camera system on the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>:
*   A 12-megapixel main camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>
*   A 2x telephoto camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>
*   An ultra-wide camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>

### Differences in Rear Camera Hardware
While both models have triple cameras, the [[differences_between_note_10_and_note_10_plus | Note 10 Plus]] includes additional depth sensors alongside the three cameras and a flash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

## Video Recording Capabilities
The cameras introduce several improvements for video capture:
*   **Ultra-Wide Video Recording**: Users can record video with the ultra-wide camera, enabling a "GoPro look" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Live Focus Video Recording**: This feature allows for real-time background blur during video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Improved Super Steady Shot**: Video stabilization has been enhanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Zoom-in Mic Feature**: As users zoom into a video, the microphone array focuses its audio capture on the zoomed-in area within the frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## Selfie Camera
The selfie camera is located in the Infinity-O cutout, a hole-punch in the center of the top of the display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This cutout is noted as being smaller than the corner cutout found on the [[samsung_galaxy_s10_models_overview | Galaxy S10]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Samsung's default wallpaper does not attempt to hide this cutout, embracing its presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## S Pen Camera Control
The [[spen_features_in_samsung_galaxy_note_10_and_note_10_plus | S Pen]] has new "air actions" for controlling the camera without touching the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. These include:
*   Holding the button and swiping to switch between camera modes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   Flipping between the selfie and rear cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   Allegedly, twirling clockwise or counterclockwise to zoom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a> (though this particular action was difficult to get working in initial hands-on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>).

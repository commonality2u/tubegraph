Despite its impressive features, the [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_specifications | Apple Vision Pro]] exhibits several limitations and drawbacks, particularly as a first-generation device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## User Experience and Control
The device's control relies entirely on hands, eyes, and voice, as there are no physical controllers provided or designed for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This reliance on [[Control methods and sensors in Apple Vision Pro | hand and eye tracking]] means:
*   **Lack of Haptic Feedback**: The absence of controllers results in no haptic feedback, which can break immersion. For instance, in a demo where a virtual butterfly landed on the user's finger, the lack of sensation reminded the user it was a VR headset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.
*   **Eye Fatigue**: While designed to minimize it, prolonged use of any headset strapped to the face will eventually lead to eye fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

## Design and Comfort
The [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | Apple Vision Pro]] is constructed from metal and glass, making it "pretty heavy" compared to most plastic VR headsets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. This weight raises concerns about user fatigue during extended use, even after a 30-minute demo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. The external battery pack, connected by a proprietary cable, is a design choice made to mitigate the weight on the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

## Battery Life and Performance
The external battery pack offers a mere two hours of battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. While it can be plugged into a wall for indefinite use, unplugging limits usage significantly, especially for activities like watching movies, most of which exceed two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.

The presence of fans or vents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a> raises questions about potential fan noise and its impact on battery life during intensive tasks like gaming, though this remains unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.

## Social and Practical Considerations
The external OLED display, designed to show the user's eyes to external observers, has been described as "weird looking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a> and "kind of creepy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. It's noted as a "bold look" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a> that may not be "smart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a> and is unlikely to be adopted by other headset manufacturers due to budget constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

The ability to record 3D photos and videos with the headset's cameras is viewed as a "weird feature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. The prospect of someone, like a parent, recording a birthday party while wearing the headset is seen as socially awkward and reminiscent of the reasons for Google Glass's failure, where the camera on the face was not socially acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

## Pricing and Market Positioning
The [[pricing_and_potential_market_for_apple_vision_pro | Apple Vision Pro]] is priced at $3,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, making it "very expensive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. This high price point, combined with the "Pro" designation, clearly positions it as a product "not for the masses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. It is currently viewed as an "early adopter" and "developer's muse" device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>, with its future direction dependent on how early users and developers utilize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.

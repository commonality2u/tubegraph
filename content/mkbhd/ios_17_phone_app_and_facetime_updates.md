[[New Features in iOS 17s Messages and Widgets | iOS 17]] introduces a variety of new features, with significant updates to the Phone and [[facetime_updates_in_ios_15 | FaceTime]] applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. These enhancements aim to refine the overall phone experience and are considered some of the most impactful additions in this version of the operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

## Key Features

### Contact Posters
A new feature allows users to customize their own "contact poster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. This poster includes your name and contact information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52">[01:52]</a>, and can be personalized with photos, fonts, and other details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23">[02:23]</a>. When you call someone who also has an [[iphone_16_and_16_pro_features_and_updates | iPhone]], they will see your custom contact poster on their screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This feature automatically updates contacts for those who have you saved, providing a more visually appealing and effortless way to manage contact photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

### Live Voicemail Transcription
[[iOS 17 Airdrop Enhancements | iOS 17]] brings back a feature reminiscent of old physical answering machines: live voicemail transcription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. When someone leaves a voicemail, a live transcription of their message appears on your screen as they speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Users have the option to interrupt the voicemail and pick up the call at any point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Old School Feature
> This live transcription and interception capability is a deliberate throwback to physical answering machines, which allowed users to hear a message being left and pick up the phone to talk directly to the caller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

### FaceTime Voicemail (Video Messages)
[[facetime_updates_in_ios_15 | FaceTime]] now supports voicemail, which takes the form of video messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. If you attempt to [[facetime_updates_in_ios_15 | FaceTime]] someone and they don't answer, you can record a video message and send it as a "voicemail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. These video messages appear in the recipient's [[facetime_updates_in_ios_15 | FaceTime]] inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

## Ecosystem Dependence
Many of the new features in [[iOS 17 Airdrop Enhancements | iOS 17]], including those in the Phone and [[facetime_updates_in_ios_15 | FaceTime]] apps, are designed to work optimally when interacting with other [[iphone_16_and_16_pro_features_and_updates | iPhone]] users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Features like contact posters, [[ios_17_airdrop_enhancements | NameDrop]], [[ios_17_airdrop_enhancements | SharePlay]], and various [[ios_18_connectivity_and_messaging_features | iMessage]] enhancements all depend on other people in your life also having an [[iphone_16_and_16_pro_features_and_updates | iPhone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. This emphasis highlights Apple's ecosystem strategy, encouraging more users to adopt their devices to fully utilize all the new functionalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

The Humane AI Pin is a new, ultra-futuristic wearable computer that, in its current state, is considered "the new worst product" reviewed by the presenter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Despite its interesting form factor and initial concept as a standalone AI assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, it suffers from numerous issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. It costs $700, plus a $24 per month subscription plan for data, services, and online storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## General Performance and AI Limitations

The Humane AI Pin is "bad at almost everything it does, basically all the time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

*   **Slow Responses**: Most requests are sent to the Cloud and take a long time to return an answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The device often feels slower than expected, even on fast Wi-Fi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Inaccuracy and Hallucinations**: The AI often provides incorrect information or hallucinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Examples include predicting a solar eclipse in 2044 days before one occurred, misunderstanding "Asian food" as "best ash," and providing incomplete or incorrect sports information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **Misunderstanding Commands**: The AI can misinterpret user commands, such as asking for traffic to the Empire State Building and receiving a generic response to "use the voice command feature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Server Timeouts**: Poor internet connections frequently lead to server timeouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **Limited Core Functionality**: The pin cannot set timers or alarms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
*   **Lack of App Ecosystem**: There are virtually no apps available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. Users can only sync with Apple, Google, Microsoft (for contacts), and Tidal (for music) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. There is no access to common services like Uber, Spotify, WhatsApp, calendar, Gmail, or Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
*   **No Personal Context**: As a standalone device that does not pair with a smartphone, the AI Pin lacks access to personal data like schedules, daily routines, contacts, and preferences stored on the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. This puts it at a significant disadvantage compared to smartphone-based assistants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.
*   **Separate Communication Threads**: The device has its own phone number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, meaning text messages sent from the Pin are separate threads from those on a smartphone, and the Pin cannot see conversations happening on the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.

## Hardware and Design Flaws

While the hardware itself is well-built and feels solid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, there are several practical drawbacks:

*   **Poor Battery Life and Management**: The battery life is "really bad" and inconsistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Users must constantly babysit the battery, swapping out "boosters" (external batteries) multiple times per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. The internal battery combined with the booster can drain completely in as little as two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Overheating**: The device is "constantly warm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a> and frequently overheats, requiring the user to wait for it to cool down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. This is partly due to the inefficiency of wireless charging through clothing, which generates heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.
*   **Weight**: Despite impressive craftsmanship, the aluminum build makes the pin "a little too heavy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>, causing clothing to sag, especially with lighter fabrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
*   **Notification Light Visibility**: The notification light at the top corner is often out of the user's peripheral vision, making it easy to miss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
*   **Wearing Annoyances**: The preferred wearing position on the chest often interferes with seat belts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. It's also cumbersome to remove and re-attach for things like airport security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.
*   **Poor Camera Quality**: Photos look "pretty bad" and videos are "even worse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. They are square-ish, noisy, and max out at 15 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.
*   **Unreliable Sync Hub**: The web portal (Humane Center) where data syncs "randomly stops working" and requires refreshing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
*   **Projector Limitations**: While a "technical achievement," the laser projector is "not very readable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>, not bright enough outdoors, and dims with distance due to physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

## Comparison to Smartphones

The biggest problem for the Humane AI Pin is that smartphones are significantly more capable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

*   **Superior Performance**: A modern smartphone performs all functions of the AI Pin "better and faster, and easier and in higher quality, and just better in every way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.
*   **Ease of Use**: Smartphones offer easier photo and video framing, simpler calling and texting, and can be used in a wider variety of environments (loud, private) and with any outfit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
*   **Frictionless Interaction**: Basic tasks like sending a picture are far more complex on the AI Pin (taking the photo, previewing a low-res image, manually entering contact, sending a link to a web portal) compared to a smartphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.
*   **Complex Tasks**: The AI Pin struggles with complex interactions like adjusting an Uber pickup location or buying items online, where a screen is essential for verification and detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

## Future Ambition vs. Current Reality

The device's limitations stem from Humane's ambition for it to be a powerful standalone device in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. By not allowing it to connect to smartphones, Humane is preventing a future removal of that feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. This approach is similar to the [[technical_limitations_and_drawbacks_of_apple_vision_pro | Apple Vision Pro]], which also operates as a standalone computer rather than pairing with an iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. Currently, the Humane AI Pin is a "victim of its future ambition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.

## Conclusion

While the Humane AI Pin occasionally delivers on its promise, such as easily remembering ideas while driving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a> or capturing unique first-person videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>, and appeals to those seeking less screen time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>, the constant "friction and fumbling and annoyance" outweigh these benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>.

The overall recommendation is that "nobody should buy this device right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. Users should not purchase a product based on the "future promise of updates" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>, as the device has a "long way to go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>, despite the respect for Humane's attempt to create something genuinely new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>.

In the realm of classic technology, old pieces of tech are generally not highly sought after by collectors, exemplified by the low demand for an iPhone 6 today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. However, one notable exception is the [[collectibility_of_factory_sealed_original_iphones | factory sealed, unopened original iPhone]], which is considered the most sought-after piece of tech in the collector's world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## The Original iPhone as a Collector's Item

### Rarity and Demand
While finding a used, working version of an original iPhone from 2007 is challenging, obtaining one that is original, still sealed, and never opened is extremely rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Only about 6 million first-generation iPhones were ever sold, meaning the number of unopened units will naturally continue to decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Scams
The significant difference in value between a used original iPhone and a new, sealed, untouched one has led to scams where individuals re-seal used original iPhones and sell them online as new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. These scams have led some YouTubers to spend thousands of dollars on what they believed were untouched devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The profit margin from re-sealing old iPhones makes the effort and materials, such as cellophane and a heat gun, well worth the price for scammers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Market Dynamics and Peak Value

Determining when the value of these rare items has peaked is a complex consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Recent auction data suggests a potential plateau or decrease in record-breaking prices.

### Auction Trends
- **February Record:** An original iPhone sold at an [[auction_process_for_buying_rare_tech_items | auction]] in February for over $60,000, setting a new record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
- **March Sale:** A month later, in March, another unit sold for $55,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
- **Recent Sale:** An even rarer version with a "lucky you" sticker, expected to fetch a higher price, sold at an [[auction_process_for_buying_rare_tech_items | auction]] in Chicago for only $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This specific unit was purchased by the narrator of the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

The [[auction_process_for_buying_rare_tech_items | auction process]] for such items often involves live-streamed events with a gavel, unlike typical online auction sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The narrator's initial bid for the $40,000 iPhone was the minimum of $32,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[00:03:04]</a>. The final price included sales tax, bidding premium, and shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[00:03:28]</a>.

### Factors Affecting Value
The specific original iPhone purchased for $40,000 may have sold for a lower price than the $60,000 record due to "browning" around its edges and a break in one of its corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The presence of a mysterious "lucky you" sticker, which is super rare and not found on other sealed iPhones, did not seem to increase its value, with even Apple employees unaware of its meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

### The Impact of Opening
Opening a factory-sealed original iPhone drastically reduces its collector's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:07:02]</a>. The original iPhone purchased for $40,000 is now worth dramatically less after being unboxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. Verification of a truly unopened iPhone is challenging, as X-rays only confirm the presence of accessories, and serial number checks only show if the phone was registered or activated, not if it was opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:05:08]</a>. Signs indicating a legitimate, unopened state include the condition of the shrink wrap on both the outer box and the inner iPhone packaging, and the difficulty of getting a 1.0 iPhone to activate past the iTunes boot screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:11:23]</a>.

Upon opening, the iPhone revealed details such as a black microfiber cloth with "iPhone" on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:15]</a>, instructions for use in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:29]</a>, slightly askew Apple stickers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:40]</a>, a sealed USB-A wall brick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:54]</a>, a 30-pin dock with a headphone jack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:09:01]</a>, a 30-pin USB-A charging/data cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:21]</a>, and wired EarPods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:26]</a>. The phone did not immediately turn on, which is expected for a 16-year-old battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:40]</a>, and it was found that the original brick often needed to be replaced for charging to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:53]</a>. It came with a gigantic AT&T Cingular exclusive SIM card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:14]</a>. The pristine condition of the new iPhone's metal contrasts sharply with a used everyday version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:10:00]</a>.

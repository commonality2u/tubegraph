Introduced with the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro, [[magsafe_charging_system | MagSafe]] is a new feature that embeds magnets into the wireless charging coil on the back of the iPhones to enable compatible accessories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:02">[06:02:02]</a>. The name "[[magsafe_charging_system | MagSafe]]" has been brought back by Apple, suggesting a potential for a wide range of new accessories that can attach to the back of the phone using these magnets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:12">[06:12:12]</a>.

## How [[magsafe_charging_system | MagSafe]] Works
When a magnet paper is placed on an iPhone 12, it immediately reveals concentric circles and straight lines for alignment, indicating the internal magnetic structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:51">[06:51:51]</a>. In contrast, an older iPhone 11 shows no such pattern, apart from the speakers at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:44">[06:44:44]</a>. Any accessory designed to work with [[magsafe_charging_system | MagSafe]] must align with these magnetic patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. An NFC chip inside [[magsafe_charging_system | MagSafe]] accessories informs the iPhone which accessory has been connected, triggering a corresponding animation on the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:45">[07:45:45]</a>.

## [[magsafe_charging_system | MagSafe]] Accessories
Several accessories have been introduced to utilize [[magsafe_charging_system | MagSafe]] technology:

### [[magsafe_charging_system | MagSafe]] Charger
This charger is a thin, hockey puck-shaped device attached to a three-foot USB-C wire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:12">[07:12:12]</a>. It resembles a larger Apple Watch charger, featuring flat metal on the exterior and white plastic on the interior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:20">[07:20:20]</a>. It attaches to the back of the iPhone, precisely centered over the Apple logo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:31">[07:31:31]</a>. Because it's a circle, it can spin freely when connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:41">[07:41:41]</a>. When connected, a circular [[magsafe_charging_system | MagSafe]] charging animation appears, indicating it's charging at 15 watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:53">[07:53:53]</a>.

### [[magsafe_charging_system | MagSafe]] Wallet
The [[magsafe_charging_system | MagSafe]] wallet has corresponding magnets to align with the iPhone's magnetic array <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:04">[08:04:04]</a>. It snaps onto the back of the phone and triggers an appropriate animation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:09">[08:09:09]</a>. The wallet is magnetically shielded to protect cards inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:24">[09:24:24]</a>.

### [[magsafe_charging_system | MagSafe]] Case
This is a full case with magnetic coils embedded within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:26">[08:26:26]</a>. When placed on the phone, the entire screen lights up with a specific animation, such as a blue animation for a Pacific Blue case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:34">[08:34:34]</a>. The benefit of a compatible case is that the [[magsafe_charging_system | MagSafe]] charger can still attach and charge the phone through the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:52">[08:52:52]</a>. Similarly, the [[magsafe_charging_system | MagSafe]] wallet can also attach and be recognized through the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:05">[09:05:05]</a>. However, attempting to charge through both the wallet and the case simultaneously will magnetize but not charge, indicating a limit to the number of accessory layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:15">[09:15:15]</a>.

## Impressions and Observations
The updated industrial design of the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro, with their boxy sides reminiscent of the iPad Pro or iPhone 4/5, is noted for feeling solid and grippable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:22">[03:22:22]</a>. The flat screen and minimal camera bump contribute to the aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:41">[03:41:41]</a>. The square sides allow the phone to stand on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:06">[04:06:06]</a>.

While [[magsafe_charging_system | MagSafe]] is considered "kind of cool," it didn't fully meet initial hopes, mainly due to the strength of the magnets, which are described as "a little loose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:44">[09:44:44]</a>. Concerns were raised about accessories like car mounts potentially not holding securely over bumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:01">[10:01:01]</a>. The [[magsafe_charging_system | MagSafe]] wallet, in particular, was noted to easily pop or slide off when put into a pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:16">[10:16:16]</a>.

It's noted that the [[magsafe_charging_system | MagSafe]] charger is still technically a Qi wireless charger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:37">[10:37:37]</a>. This means it can magnetize and wirelessly charge many other Android phones that support Qi wireless charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:46">[10:46:46]</a>.

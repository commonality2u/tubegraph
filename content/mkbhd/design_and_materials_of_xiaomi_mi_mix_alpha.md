The [[Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha wraparound display concept | Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha]] is presented as a functional smartphone prototype by Xiaomi, aiming to demonstrate an innovative idea: a display that curves completely around the back of the phone, resulting in nearly 110% screen coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This design pushes the limits of smartphone aesthetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Build Quality and Materials
The [[Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha wraparound display concept | Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha]] stands out for its next-level materials and [[technical_specifications_of_xiaomi_mi_mix_alpha | technical specifications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Frame**: The phone's frame is constructed from a titanium alloy, noted to be harder than stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Camera Covers**: The camera covers are made entirely from sapphire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Camera Strip**: The vertical camera strip on the back is ceramic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
The device feels heavy and dense, indicative of the substantial materials and extra glass used for the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Display Design and Integration
The primary focus of the [[Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha wraparound display concept | Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha]] is its unique display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Resolution**: It features a 2088 x 2250 OLED display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Bezels**: The top and bottom bezels are very thin, wrapping around to meet the camera strip at the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Camera Integration**: The camera strip houses the primary 108-megapixel camera, a 20-megapixel ultra-wide lens with macro capabilities, a 12-megapixel telephoto camera, and a dual LED flash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **In-Display Features**: The phone includes an in-display fingerprint reader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Software Optimizations**: Xiaomi's MIUI Alpha software relocates battery, status bar icons, and notification counters to the side of the phone, cleaning up the top front display area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Charging Animation**: A notable [[innovative_features_and_functionality_of_xiaomi_mi_mix_alpha | innovative feature]] is the charging animation, where the entire wraparound screen lights up and animates the battery filling up like liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Notifications also glow across the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## User Experience and Practicality
Holding the [[Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha wraparound display concept | Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha]] provides a unique experience due to its full-screen design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Feel in Hand**: It is heavy, but surprisingly not as slippery as other glass phones, as the finger feels grippy with the display glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. The immersion factor is very real, feeling like holding "all screen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Speaker and Selfie Camera**: A regular speaker is located at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. For phone calls, an electromagnetic speaker vibrates through the glass to create sound, a technology seen in previous Mix phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. There is no dedicated selfie camera; instead, users flip the phone to use the main 108-megapixel camera for selfies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Virtual Side Buttons**: The prototype features virtual power and volume buttons on the right side of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. While the power button worked more often, the volume control was inconsistent, requiring specific handling to avoid palm touches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. A physical circular power button is still present at the top of the phone for sleep/wake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Palm Rejection**: The device attempts palm rejection using a combination of accelerometers, gyroscopes, pressure sensors, and software algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This is cited as the biggest [[challenges_and_practical_considerations_of_xiaomi_mi_mix_alpha | challenge for a wraparound screen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. It is "hit or miss," sometimes working impressively but often leading to accidental presses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Protective Case**: A case exists for the phone, anchoring to the camera strip and offering minimal external protection, suggesting that accepting the phone's delicate nature might be more practical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

## Prototype Imperfections
As a prototype, the [[Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha wraparound display concept | Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha]] exhibits several imperfections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **Display Edges**: There is a noticeable gap in the cover glass at the apex of the curved sides, indicating that the display is composed of three connecting pieces rather than one seamless curved piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This break in smoothness catches light, creating a rainbow effect that detracts from the wraparound illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Display Yellowing**: Some yellowing can be observed at the very edges of the display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   **Stability**: The phone wobbles significantly when placed on a desk due to the camera strip, as there's no flat surface to lie on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

## Display Metrics
The official screen-to-body ratio is stated as 180.6%, though this is questionable given the presence of 2.15mm bezels at the top and bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Similarly, the stated 7.9-inch diagonal screen size is misleading as it's measured around the back corner-to-corner; in reality, the phone is closer in size to an [[iphone_xr_design_and_build_quality | iPhone XR]], [[oneplus_6_design_and_build_quality | OnePlus 6]], [[design_and_build_quality_of_iphone_6s | iPhone 6s]], [[design_and_build_quality_of_the_iphone_15_pro | iPhone 15 Pro Max]], or Pixel 4 or iPhone 11 Pro Max <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

Overall, the [[Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha wraparound display concept | Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha]] is acknowledged as an impressive functional prototype, serving as a "form over function" concept smartphone in the same vein as concept cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

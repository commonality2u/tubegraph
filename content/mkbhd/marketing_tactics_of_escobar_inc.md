Escobar Inc, a company linked to Roberto Escobar, the brother of infamous drug lord Pablo Escobar, employed controversial and deceptive [[marketing_strategies_and_loss_leader_strategy | marketing strategies]] to promote its folding smartphones, the Escobar Fold and Escobar Fold 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. These tactics generated significant media attention but ultimately pointed to a scam operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Leveraging the Escobar Name
The primary marketing tactic was the controversial use of the [[pablo_escobars_legacy_and_brand_association | Escobar name]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Despite the negative connotations associated with Pablo Escobar, a Colombian drug lord known for violence and making Colombia the murder capital of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, the name itself is widely recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This notoriety instantly drew "eyeballs and turned a lot of heads" in the tech world when the folding phone surfaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Product Misrepresentation and "Loss Leader" Pricing
The Escobar Fold phones were not original devices but re-branded versions of existing folding smartphones:
*   **Escobar Fold**: This device was identified as a Royole FlexPai with a gold accent taped onto it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Escobar Fold 2**: This was a Samsung Galaxy Fold with gold tin foil adhesive attached to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. The Samsung logo was even visible underneath the foil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. It was described as a "really poor rebranding job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

A key element of their [[marketing_strategies_and_loss_leader_strategy | marketing strategy]] was an unbelievably low price point for these re-branded devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>:
*   The original Escobar Fold was priced at $350 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   The Escobar Fold 2 was advertised at $400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
Given that a genuine Samsung Galaxy Fold cost $1,800, this drastic price difference raised immediate suspicion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

## Deceptive Website and Selective Shipping
Escobar Inc's website was described as "a little suspect" with "wild pictures and statements" and "pretty bold claims," lacking the professionalism expected from a phone retailer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

A primary tactic for generating positive coverage without incurring significant costs was selective shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>:
*   The company would prioritize shipping phones only to YouTubers, tech media, or individuals they believed would publicly discuss the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   Most other customers who ordered the phones simply never received them, with order trackers remaining in a "pending" or "in production" state for months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   For example, a tech reviewer who purchased two Escobar Fold phones for $750 never received them until a negative tweet was posted. Shortly after, one of the reviewer's original orders was "upgraded" and shipped to the reviewer's address, seemingly to prompt positive coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

## Promotional Content and Celebrity Endorsements
Escobar Inc maintained an "incredible" YouTube channel that showcased peculiar and aggressive [[marketing_strategies_and_loss_leader_strategy | marketing strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>:
*   **"RIP Samsung.com" Video**: This video showed individuals smashing actual, unbranded Samsung Galaxy Folds with sledgehammers until they caught fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. The company even bought the URL "RIP Samsung.com" which redirected to Escobar Inc's website, despite their phone relying on Samsung's technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Questionable Unboxing Video**: An unboxing video was deemed problematic enough that showing more than a few seconds of it would risk demonetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   **[[Celebrity endorsements and influence on sales | Celebrity Endorsements]]**: The company featured endorsement videos from celebrities like Chris Hansen (from *To Catch a Predator*) and Anna Anka (ex-wife of Paul Anka) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. These videos were likely obtained through Cameo, a platform where users can pay celebrities for personalized video messages, suggesting the celebrities might not have been aware their videos were used to promote a potential scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

## Conclusion
The [[marketing_strategies_and_loss_leader_strategy | marketing strategies]] of Escobar Inc were designed to create immense buzz and perceived value through association with the Escobar name and an impossibly low price, while relying on deceptive practices like re-branding existing tech and selective shipping to generate media attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. The company's operations and marketing are viewed as a scam, with many customers not receiving their orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

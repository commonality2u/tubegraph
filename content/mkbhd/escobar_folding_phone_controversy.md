In 2020, as [[overview_of_folding_smartphones_in_2020 | folding smartphones]] became prevalent, a new contender emerged: the Escobar folding phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This device, associated with the controversial Escobar name, gained significant attention in the tech world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## The Escobar Name
The name "Escobar" refers to Pablo Escobar, the Colombian drug lord known as the wealthiest criminal in history for monopolizing cocaine trade into the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. His legacy includes being known for killings of police officers and politicians, and making Colombia the murder capital of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This notorious name is leveraged for the phone to gain recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Escobar Fold (Original)
The first Escobar folding phone was priced at $350 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Upon closer inspection, it was revealed to be a [[royal_flex_pai_folding_phone_review | Royal Flex Pai]] with a gold accent taped to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. An order for this phone was placed on December 5, 2019, but it was never received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The company's website raised suspicions with its unprofessional appearance, wild pictures, and bold claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The order tracker for this device remained "pending" for months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Escobar Fold 2
Headlines later emerged about a second version, the Escobar Fold 2, priced at $400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This phone also looked familiar, and upon unboxing, it became clear it was a re-branded [[comparison_of_escobar_fold_and_samsung_galaxy_fold | Samsung Galaxy Fold]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Specifically, it appeared to be the newer [[samsung_galaxy_fold_design_changes | Samsung Galaxy Fold]] model, featuring dust caps on the hinges and a slightly stiffer hinge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. The "Escobar" branding was merely a gold foil adhesive that could be removed to reveal the Samsung logo underneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This [[folding_phone_hinge_and_durability | rebranding job]] was considered poor quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

Despite initial attempts to secure a review unit being declined by Escobar Inc., a second personal order was placed for the Escobar Fold 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. While the first order (Escobar Fold 1) was never fulfilled, a package containing the Escobar Fold 2 arrived on February 24, 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. It was later confirmed via email that the original Fold 1 order had been "upgraded" to a Fold 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Other tech reviewers also reportedly received similar upgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

The [[user_perception_and_future_of_foldable_phones | user perception and future of foldable phones]] were significantly impacted by the [[implications_of_galaxy_fold_failures_for_foldable_phones | implications of Galaxy Fold failures for foldable phones]], but the Escobar Fold 2 controversy added another layer of complexity, essentially selling an $1800 phone for $400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

## The Scam Theory
The theory behind how Escobar Inc. could offer a Samsung Galaxy Fold for such a low price is that they selectively ship phones to YouTubers and tech media, hoping for positive coverage, while not fulfilling orders for the general public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. This explains why the reviewer's first order was eventually shipped after negative tweets, as it had their name attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## Key Figures
The two main individuals involved in Escobar Inc. are:
*   **Roberto Escobar**: Pablo Escobar's older brother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Olaf Gustafson**: The CEO of Escobar Inc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Gustafson is described as a younger, tech-savvy individual who convinced Roberto Escobar to use the family name to make money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. He has a Twitter account where he promotes articles and photos with celebrities, and has been involved in cloning Elon Musk's Boring Company flamethrower and a cryptocurrency that failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

## Marketing Tactics
The marketing for the Escobar Fold is notably aggressive and misleading:
*   **Website**: Described as unprofessional with "wild pictures and statements" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **YouTube Channel**: Features videos like:
    *   A one-minute video panning across five fold phones, possibly all they had made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
    *   An unboxing video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
    *   "RIP Samsung.com," a video showing Samsung Galaxy Folds being smashed with sledgehammers until they catch fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. The company bought the URL ripsamsung.com, which redirects to Escobarinc.com, despite their phone being a re-branded Samsung device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Celebrity Endorsements**: Videos featuring Chris Hanson (of *To Catch a Predator*) and Ana Anka (ex-wife of Paul Anka) endorsing the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. These endorsements appear to be paid requests from the site Cameo, and it's unlikely the celebrities were aware their videos would be used to promote a scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

## Conclusion and Warning
The Escobar folding phone is an example of a company attempting to scam consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. There are numerous cases of people not receiving their Escobar Fold orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. Consumers are strongly advised against purchasing anything from Escobar Inc. or any associated individuals, as the phone itself is merely a [[speculation_on_future_foldable_phones | rebranded]] [[comparison_of_escobar_fold and_samsung_galaxy_fold | Samsung Galaxy Fold]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

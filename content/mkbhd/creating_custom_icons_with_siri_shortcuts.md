Since [[iOS 14 home screen customization levels | iOS 14]] became public, users have found new ways to customize their [[customizable_lock_screen_and_notifications | iPhone home screens]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. One advanced method involves using Siri Shortcuts to create custom app icons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## How to Create a Custom Icon

While it appears you can apply custom icons directly, this method uses Siri Shortcuts as a workaround <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>:

1.  **Open the Siri Shortcuts App**: Ensure you have the Shortcuts app installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
2.  **Add a New Shortcut**: Tap the "plus" sign to create a new shortcut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
3.  **Choose "Open App" Action**: Add a new action and select "Open App" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
4.  **Select Target App**: Choose the specific app you want this custom icon to open (e.g., the Camera app) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
5.  **Add to Home Screen**: Tap the three dots in the top corner, then select "Add to Home Screen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
6.  **Customize Icon and Name**:
    *   You can change the name that appears under the icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
    *   **Pro Tip**: Leave the name field blank for a cleaner, label-free look on your [[customizable_lock_screen_and_notifications | home screen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
    *   Pick your desired icon from your photos or files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
7.  **Finalize**: Tap "Add" to place your new shortcut icon on your [[customizable_lock_screen_and_notifications | home screen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## Limitations and Downsides

> [!WARNING] Workaround, Not Native
> These custom icons are not truly native app icons but rather Siri Shortcuts that launch applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

There are a few drawbacks to this method:
*   **Opening Delay**: Every time you tap a custom icon, the system first opens the Siri Shortcuts app, then redirects to the desired application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. This process takes approximately a quarter to half a second and does not get faster over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **No Notification Badges**: Custom shortcut icons do not display the red notification badges that native app icons do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. This means you won't see unread counts for apps like Messages if you use a custom icon for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   **Not Ideal for All Icons**: Due to these limitations, it's generally not recommended to fill an entire [[customizable_lock_screen_and_notifications | home screen]] with these custom icons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

## Icon Resources

Despite the limitations, many users create impressive color-coded or themed [[customizable_lock_screen_and_notifications | home screens]] using these shortcuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Icon Packs**: Various icon packs are available online that offer multiple icons of the same style or theme, saving you from searching for individual icons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Personal Photos**: You can also use any photo you've taken as an icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

This feature, while a workaround, offers a significant increase in [[customizable_lock_screen_and_notifications | home screen]] customization compared to previous iOS versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

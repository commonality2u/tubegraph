The Apple Vision Pro is described as an interesting, risky, and new product for Apple, despite being a [[virtual_reality_vr_and_augmented_reality_ar | VR headset]] which is not fundamentally new technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Its release implies a significant [[future_prospects_and_challenges | future]] for this type of technology, akin to the evolution of the iPhone, Mac, and iPad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The "Pro" designation in its first generation also carries further implications for its development path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Key Features and User Experience

The Vision Pro offers absolutely amazing and unparalleled aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, but also comes with downfalls, flaws, and trade-offs typical of new technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Display Fidelity
The Vision Pro features the sharpest and best-looking micro-OLED display among various [[virtual_reality_vr_and_augmented_reality_ar | VR headsets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Individual pixels are 7.5 microns, allowing 64 of them to fit into a single iPhone screen's pixel, eliminating a visible screen door effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The native refresh rate is 90 hertz, increasing to 96 hertz for 24 FPS content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Each display is factory calibrated for maximum color accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

Due to the high pixel count, the internal computer cannot render everything in high resolution at all times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Instead, it uses foveated rendering combined with fast eye tracking to render only what the user is looking at in high resolution, making the periphery soft and fuzzy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This mimics natural human vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

A notable limitation for immersion is the field of view. While the center is incredibly sharp, the edges of the headset are slightly further in than the edges of human vision, creating a "cone effect" and some chromatic aberration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. Apple has not published field of view numbers, and the [[comparison_with_other_vr_headsets | Quest 3]] reportedly offers a wider field of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Passthrough Technology
The Vision Pro boasts the best passthrough of any headset to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This feature is crucial for Apple's vision of [[virtual_reality_vr_and_augmented_reality_ar | AR]], aiming for clear overlays onto the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. It uses high-quality camera feeds and displays to simulate looking through the device at the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The sharpness, colors, and low latency prevent eye fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

Users can interact with their real-world environment, pick up objects, walk around, and even play table tennis while wearing the headset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. The total latency from outside light to updated image hitting the eyeballs is 12 milliseconds, enabled by the specially designed R1 chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. However, it still relies on cameras and screens, meaning exposure settings can cause noise in darker environments, and occasional glitches like hand occlusion breaks or floating objects in low light can occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### Apple Ecosystem Integration
The ecosystem is a strong argument for the Vision Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Built-in apps like iMessage and Photos seamlessly integrate with existing Apple accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Continuity features allow copying text between Mac, iPhone, and Vision Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

Two particularly impressive features are:
*   **FaceTime:** It uses scanned personas and spatial audio, creating a more natural conversation experience despite the initial novelty of virtual versions of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. It offers a real-time first-person view to interact with physical objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   **Mac Virtual Display:** This is a favorite feature, allowing users to connect to their Mac and create a new virtual display that can be scaled to any size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Users can also open simultaneous Vision Pro apps around the Mac display, placing them anywhere in the virtual space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. While not perfect (e.g., inability to see a physical keyboard in immersive environments, single virtual monitor limit), it offers a unique multi-tasking experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

## Current Weaknesses and Challenges

As a first-generation product, the Vision Pro faces several challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.

### App Availability
At launch, there were 600 apps specifically made for the Vision Pro, in addition to millions of compatible iPad apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. While some of these are impressive and utilize 3D space creatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>, there are more conceptual ideas for [[virtual_reality_vr_and_augmented_reality_ar | VR and AR]] experiences than actual available applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. Notably absent are official apps from major platforms like YouTube, Netflix, Spotify, and TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

### Weight and Comfort
The Vision Pro is heavy, weighing nearly 650 grams, about 25% more than the [[comparison_with_other_vr_headsets | Quest 3]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. While the internal components use lightweight materials, the primary issue lies with the Solo Knit strap, which is aesthetically pleasing but places all the weight and pressure on two points on the front of the face (above the eyes and on the cheeks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. This makes extended use uncomfortable, typically limiting wear to 30-45 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

Apple includes a second option, the dual loop band, which is less stylish but significantly improves comfort for long-term use by distributing weight to the top of the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

### EyeSight Display
The external EyeSight display, designed to show the user's eyes to the outside world, doesn't fully achieve its intended purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. The headset's reflective glass often makes the eyes hard to see, and when visible, the lenticular display renders them at a low resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>. This often fails to create genuine eye contact, contrasting with marketing visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. Its future inclusion in subsequent generations, especially a potentially less expensive "Apple Vision" model, remains uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.

## Future Prospects and Expectations

The Vision Pro is currently a "really expensive, really fun toy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. It excels at consuming media and some early [[game_compatibility_and_nextgen_gaming_experience | games]], and offers unique experiences like watching movies on a gigantic private screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.

Despite its first-generation drawbacks (heavy, limited apps, mediocre battery life, high price) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>, there's a strong indication of [[future_prospects_and_challenges | future success]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>. Similar to early iPhones, Apple Watch, and iPads, initial issues don't preclude long-term adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>. The "sci-fi, fun nature" of controlling elements with hands and moving windows around a room, coupled with the broadly appealing concepts for [[virtual_reality_vr_and_augmented_reality_ar | VR and AR]] experiences, suggest a strong underlying demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

The increased attention on [[virtual_reality_vr_and_augmented_reality_ar | VR headsets]] due to the Vision Pro is expected to highlight more affordable competitors like the [[comparison_with_other_vr_headsets | $500 Quest 3]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. Concurrently, this new developer focus on the [[virtual_reality_vr_and_augmented_reality_ar | VR/AR]] space is anticipated to lead to cooler and more awesome applications, rapidly improving the value proposition of the Vision Pro and similar devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. The speaker is very excited for the next generation of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>.

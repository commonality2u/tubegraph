The Ford F-150 Lightning is presented as a significant electric vehicle, with its electric version of the Ford F-150 being a major development given the F-150's long-standing popularity as the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. for 40 years straight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Exterior Design

The exterior of the Ford F-150 Lightning largely resembles any other Ford F-150 truck, making it difficult to distinguish as an electric vehicle without looking for specific hints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This approach maintains the familiar and proven [[vehicle_design_and_aesthetics | design]] of the F-150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Lighting
Distinctive lighting details have been added to the Ford F-150 Lightning:
*   **Front Lights**: Feature an angular shape with a daytime running light extending across the entire front for symmetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Rear Lights**: Also designed as a full-length bar light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Front Grille
Unlike traditional gas-powered vehicles, the electric F-150 Lightning does not require a large air intake. Its front grille is a plastic insert that still maintains a decent aesthetic alongside the headlights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

### Badging
The truck features specific badging to denote its electric nature:
*   Blue and black "Lightning" text badges are present on either side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   A small blue lightning electric bolt is located on the bottom right side of the liftgate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The full badge can be read as "Ford F-150 Lightning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### Charge Port
The charge port is located behind a door on the driver's side, labeled "F-150 Platinum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. An identical non-functional panel exists on the opposite side of the vehicle purely for aesthetic symmetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Dimensions and Configuration
The Ford F-150 Lightning is a large vehicle with four doors and a five-and-a-half-foot bed, offering ample space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. The "Platinum" badge indicates the highest trim level, which includes features like leather seats and a sunroof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Unique Electric Vehicle Features

### Front Trunk (Frunk)
A significant new feature for the F-150 Lightning is its massive front trunk, or "frunk," located where a traditional engine would be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Storage**: This covered, locked, and weather-sealed storage space is ideal for items not suited for the truck bed or back seat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Size**: It is described as one of the biggest front trunks seen in an EV, capable of fitting several pieces of luggage and bags like a regular car trunk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. A diagram inside the hood shows it can accommodate two full-size golf bags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   **Internal Features**:
    *   Lights shine down from the top of the hood to illuminate the interior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
    *   A removable cover at the bottom reveals more storage and can be repositioned to act as a divider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
    *   A drain hole at the bottom allows for draining water, suggesting it can be used as a cooler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Power Outlets**: The frunk includes four wall plugs, a USB-C port, and a USB-A port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### Onboard Power Outlets
The F-150 Lightning provides significant onboard power for work or other uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>:
*   **Bed Outlets**: The bed of the truck includes 240-volt power and 420-volt outlets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Functionality**: This allows for powering tools, air compressors, table saws, drills, and large lights directly from the truck, eliminating the need for a separate generator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. The truck effectively acts as a large portable power bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. An outdated sticker warns against leaving the "engine running" indoors, highlighting the electric nature of the vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

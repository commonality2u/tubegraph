The Samsung S24 Ultra is presented as a leading smartphone in 2024, emphasizing its comprehensive [[software_and_user_experience | software and user experience]] and advanced AI features [00:59:00]. The device is designed to be the "smartest smartphone," incorporating numerous helpful AI functionalities that make a meaningful difference in daily use [08:33:00].

### AI Features and Partnerships

Many of the S24 Ultra's AI capabilities are developed in partnership with Google [08:58:00]. This collaboration allows Samsung to integrate advanced features necessary to compete effectively, particularly against the iPhone [09:08:00].

All AI features are organized under a section called "Advanced Intelligence" within the phone's settings [11:59:00]. These features are designed to be mostly tucked away, allowing users to activate them only when needed [16:15:00].

### AI-Driven Photo Editing

The Samsung Gallery app offers a suite of AI-driven tools that activate based on the auto-detected scene in a photo [09:38:00]:
*   **Remaster Button:** This feature allows users to enhance photos by adding contrast and brightening elements as needed, providing a "before and after" view [09:47:00].
*   **Erase Reflections:** For images containing glass or windows, the phone displays an "Erase Reflections" button [09:57:00]. Users can circle reflections to remove them, with the AI generatively filling the space with what should be present in the glass [10:01:00].
*   **Add Background Blur:** The phone can identify a subject in a photo not taken in portrait mode and offer to add background blur [10:10:00]. It analyzes the subject to create a portrait mode effect with a good cutout, even without additional depth information [10:14:00].
*   **Magic Editor:** This feature, similar to Google Pixel's Magic Editor, allows for extensive photo manipulation [10:28:00]. Users can move subjects around a photo, with the AI generatively filling the background [10:48:00]. It can also remove unwanted objects or "photo bombers" from the foreground or background [10:52:00]. A particularly useful function is the ability to tilt the horizon of a photo without cropping, as the Magic Editor will generatively fill in the resulting empty areas at the edges [11:10:00]. These editing capabilities apply to any photos downloaded to the phone, not just those taken with its camera [11:28:00].

#### AI Manipulation Watermark
When a photo is altered using the Magic Editor, the S24 Ultra adds a small watermark with stars in the bottom corner to indicate AI manipulation [11:38:00]. However, this watermark can be immediately removed using the built-in object removal tool in Samsung's Photo Editor app [11:53:00].

### Other Notable AI Features

*   **Live Phone Call Translation:** The phone includes a feature for real-time translation during phone calls [12:10:00].
*   **Voice Recorder Enhancements:** The Voice Recorder app offers improved speaker labels, summaries, and transcriptions of recordings [12:13:00].
*   **Samsung Browser Summaries:** The Samsung Browser can generate summaries of webpages [12:19:00].

### Circle to Search

"Circle to Search" is highlighted as a standout new feature, streamlining the search process [12:24:00]. While Google Lens has long provided similar functionality, Circle to Search condenses multiple steps into one [12:28:00]. By holding down the home button or gesture bar, users can circle or tap any item on the screen to perform an immediate Google search without leaving the current application [12:44:00]. This feature is fast and consistently effective, working with pictures, parts of pictures, objects via the camera viewfinder, landmarks, and text [12:56:00]. Users can also append additional text to their searches [13:11:00]. While selecting text can sometimes be "fidgety," the S Pen can offer more precise selection [13:21:00].

### Software Update Commitment

Samsung has committed to providing seven years of security updates and seven generations of major software updates for the S24 lineup [14:01:00]. This commitment means the S24 Ultra will remain up to date until 2031 [14:18:00].

### iPhone-Inspired Software Elements

The S24 Ultra incorporates several [[software_and_user_experience | software and user experience]] features similar to those found on the iPhone [15:18:00]:
*   **Always On Display:** The S24 Ultra now features an Always On Display that shows the entire wallpaper, appearing "half awake," much like the iPhone [15:18:00]. This feature can be turned off to conserve battery life [15:25:00].
*   **Object Cutout for Stickers:** Users can long-press to select an object in a photo, which automatically cuts it out and converts it into a sticker for use in other applications [15:28:00].
*   **Lock Screen Widgets:** New lock screen widgets are present, designed to look similar to those on the iPhone [15:37:00].

### Other AI Features

The S24 Ultra also includes AI-generated wallpapers with a dedicated section [16:08:00].

Apple's recent announcements highlight a growing trend where new hardware is introduced, but many of its touted software features are not available at launch, instead arriving in subsequent updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. This creates a significant separation between the physical product and its promised capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## iPhone
The [[iPhone 16 and 16 Pro features and updates | iPhone 16]] and [[iPhone 16 and 16 Pro features and updates | 16 Pro]], while featuring minor incremental updates to hardware like a faster chip, better screen, and slightly better cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, will launch with iOS 18.0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This means they will have "no Apple intelligence features at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

Key Apple Intelligence features missing at launch include:
*   Genmoji <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>
*   Image Playground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>
*   Writing tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>
*   The new Siri <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>

These features are expected to be rolled out "bit by bit with software updates," with iOS 18.1 bringing the new Siri and various writing tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. This emphasizes a departure from the traditional model where new software capabilities are intrinsically linked to the new hardware release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

> "If you've watched my videos before you know about one of the golden rules which is to never buy something based on the promise of future software updates so this feels like a big separation moment for the iPhone at least to me where each year of the new physical phone that you buy is just a small improvement it's just a little bit faster chip a little bit better screen slightly better cameras but on the other side is this rapidly improving ball of all this AI stuff that is not launching on the phone but that is the totally separate really big reason to get the phone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>

### Camera Control Button
The new "camera control" button on the [[iPhone 16 and 16 Pro features and updates | iPhone 16]] and [[iPhone 16 and 16 Pro features and updates | 16 Pro]] is an example of hardware that will gain full functionality later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. While it can open the camera and take photos immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, its two-stage shutter press and other interactive features within the camera app will be enabled via a software update later in the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

## Apple Watch
The Apple Watch Series 10 introduces a new feature, sleep apnea detection, which uses only the gyroscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. However, this is another "coming soon" feature, pending FDA approval and regulatory bodies worldwide to actually launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

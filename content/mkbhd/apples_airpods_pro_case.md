The [[apples_new_airpods_and_airpods_pro_features | AirPods Pro]] come with a new charging case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### Design and Portability
The new case is slightly larger, specifically a bit wider, than the previous AirPods case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. It's described as looking like the old case turned sideways and stretched a bit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Despite its slightly increased size, it remains very pocketable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### Charging and Battery Life
The case supports wireless charging, similar to the second-generation AirPods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. It offers quick charging capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. When combined with the case, the [[apples_new_airpods_and_airpods_pro_features | AirPods Pro]] provide a total of 24 hours of battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. The charging port on the case is still Lightning, not USB-C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### Pricing and Availability
The [[apples_new_airpods_and_airpods_pro_features | AirPods Pro]], including their case, cost $250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. They were quietly released online and were available in stores by October 30th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

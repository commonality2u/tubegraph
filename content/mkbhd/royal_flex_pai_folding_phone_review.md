The Royal Flex Pai was the first and only folding phone to actually ship in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, even as rumors about the [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Samsung Galaxy Fold]] relaunch continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. It was briefly seen at CES in January, but a proper hands-on review was limited until a full studio review was possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Initial Impressions and Design Philosophy

Upon first holding the Flex Pai, the initial impression was that it looked "really weird" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The phone's design features the screen on the outside when folded, which, in review, was determined not to be the optimal approach for a folding phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## [[folding_phone_design_challenges | Design Challenges]] and Flaws

The "folding screen on the outside" design choice presents several issues:
*   **Exposed Screen** The flexible OLED panel, the most delicate part, is constantly exposed to the elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Thickness** The device is thicker because internal components cannot fold completely flat onto each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Sharp Curve** Unlike folding paper, the fold's radius is much greater than zero, resulting in a sharp curve rather than a true fold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Bulkiness** The overall device becomes too chunky to fit reasonably in most pockets when folded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## [[folding_phone_hinge_and_durability | Hinge and Durability Concerns]]

The hinge, a critical and vulnerable part of the phone, is covered in an accordion-shaped rubber and screwed in on the sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. This design is not smooth to fold, sometimes makes noises, and raises doubts about its long-term durability against wear, sun exposure, scratches, or even ripping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. While the rubber might prevent debris from entering the hinge and damaging the screen, it makes the phone resemble an accordion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Unlike the [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Galaxy Fold]]'s highly engineered hinge, which claimed 200,000 folds by a robot, the Flex Pai gives no impression of comparable durability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Screen and Creases

Due to its outward-folding mechanism, the Royal Flex Pai has two visible creases, one on either side of the hinge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. The manufacturer markets it as a "three-screen phone" with a front, back, and side screen, although the side screen is considered an awkward sliding shortcut UI rather than a full screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Water OS Features

The custom Water OS attempts to leverage the folding form factor with unique features:
*   **Back Screen Control** Users can turn the back screen on or off at any time via a button in the navigation bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **Separate UI States** The front and back screens are treated as different user interfaces, remembering their respective states separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. For example, opening settings on one side and the clock on the other means both apps remain open on their respective sides when flipping between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This is similar to how the [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Galaxy Fold]] treated its front and back screens, with different wallpapers and app layouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **Dual Camera Viewfinder** With a dual camera layout, both the front and back of the phone can show a viewfinder while taking a photo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. This allows for higher-quality selfies with the main camera and enables subjects to see themselves on the back screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Baby Mode** A feature in camera settings replaces the back screen with entertaining cartoons to capture a baby's attention for photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

### Camera Limitations

A significant limitation is the inability to take photos of subjects not facing the user when the phone is unfolded, as all cameras face the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Taking such photos requires closing the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

## Auto-Rotate Quirk

The phone exhibits an unusual auto-rotate behavior where almost every rotation permutation works, but not all of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. There are about 16 possible ways to rotate the screen, with approximately 14 of them functioning correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

## Overall User Experience and Rushing to Market

The Royal Flex Pai is a very early folding phone, reflecting a rushed effort to be first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. While animations have improved since CES, they are still not fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. The physical act of folding the screen in half on this phone is incredibly awkward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Other annoyances include:
*   Split volume buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   Lack of a headphone jack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   Noises when folding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   Water OS lacking English translation and Google Play services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   A peculiar battery concern requiring the phone to be unfolded for charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

Despite its flaws, the Flex Pai demonstrates flashes of brilliance, particularly the fact that a screen can fold backward and remain perfectly functional and responsive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Conclusions

Playing with the Royal Flex Pai led to two main conclusions regarding [[user_perception_and_future_of_foldable_phones | folding phone technology]]:
1.  **Being First Doesn't Matter if it Sucks**: Rushing to be the first to market with new technology, especially folding phones, doesn't guarantee success if the product is not polished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
2.  **Folding In is Better Than Folding Out**: While folding-out designs like the [[speculation_on_future_foldable_phones | Huawei Mate X]] might look aesthetically better, the current state of screens and hinges makes folding *in* the more practical and durable method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The [[speculation_on_future_foldable_phones | Motorola RAZR]]'s inward folding design is also considered a good approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

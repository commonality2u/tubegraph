Apple introduced the [[new_features_of_the_iphone_15_lineup | iPhone 15]] and [[iphone_15_pro_advanced_features | iPhone 15 Pro]] lineup, featuring several updates to their camera systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## [[new_features_of_the_iphone_15_lineup | iPhone 15]] and [[new_features_of_the_iphone_15_lineup | iPhone 15 Plus]] Cameras

The baseline [[new_features_of_the_iphone_15_lineup | iPhone 15]] and [[new_features_of_the_iphone_15_lineup | iPhone 15 Plus]] models have received a new primary camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

*   **Primary Camera**: The main camera is now a 48-megapixel chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>, which is presumably the same one featured in the [[iphone_14_pro_camera_upgrades | iPhone 14 Pro]] from the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.
*   **Next-Generation Portrait Mode**: A new portrait mode feature automatically detects subjects in a photo and captures all necessary depth information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. This allows users to convert a regular photo into a portrait mode photo later with high-quality results, even if they forgot to switch modes initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. This feature is also available on the Pro models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

## [[iphone_15_pro_advanced_features | iPhone 15 Pro]] and [[iphone_15_pro_advanced_features | iPhone 15 Pro Max]] Cameras

The [[iphone_15_pro_advanced_features | iPhone 15 Pro]] and [[iphone_15_pro_advanced_features | iPhone 15 Pro Max]] models include more significant camera enhancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.

*   **Main Sensor**: There's a new, larger 48-megapixel main sensor for the Pro models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>.
*   **Ultra Wide Camera**: The ultra wide camera has been improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>.
*   **Telephoto Camera**:
    *   The [[iphone_15_pro_advanced_features | iPhone 15 Pro Max]] exclusively features a new, intricate folding 5X telephoto camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.
    *   The standard [[iphone_15_pro_advanced_features | iPhone 15 Pro]] retains the 3X telephoto lens from the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.
*   **Default Focal Length Setting**: A seemingly random, but notable feature allows users to change their default focal length in the camera settings to either 1X, 1.2X, or 1.5X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>. This means the 1X button in the camera app will always take you to the chosen default focal length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>. Users can still access other focal lengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>.

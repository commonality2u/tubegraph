The Humane AI Pin is an ultra-futuristic wearable computer, representing a new generation of genuinely new first-generation products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Although it features an interesting form factor, it is also described in its current state as the "worst product" the reviewer has ever tested due to numerous [[drawbacks_of_the_humane_ai_pin | issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Core Concept and Cost

The Humane AI Pin is a small, wearable computer designed with an [[software_and_ai_capabilities | AI]] inside to assist users throughout their day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. It is about the size of a large watch and includes a camera, microphone, touchpad, and projector for interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

The device costs $700, plus a $24 per month subscription plan for data, services, and online storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. A key distinguishing feature is that it does not pair with a smartphone; instead, it is a standalone device with its own internet connection and phone number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The intention is for this [[software_and_ai_capabilities | AI assistant]] to be an always-connected companion, allowing users to choose how much or how little to use it alongside their smartphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Hardware Design

### Physical Attributes
The build quality of the Humane AI Pin is described as impressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The pin itself is solid, made of aluminum, and feels dense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. It comes in three colors: matte black (the cheapest), or white and black/silver for an additional $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

The device packs numerous sensors, including a camera, microphones, lights, and a tiny Class 2 laser projector, making it densely packed with technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The magnets used to connect its components are super strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Lights at the top illuminate when the device is active, and a small pin light indicates waiting notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Battery System
The back of the pin is called a "booster," which is an additional battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. The pin has its own internal battery, allowing for hot-swapping between the two included booster batteries to keep the device alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. The boosters attach cleverly through clothing via magnets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

The device also comes with a well-made, highly reflective charging case, allowing the pin or just the booster battery to be topped off via USB Type-C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. A desktop charging puck is also included, which can magnetize and charge either the battery or the entire pin with booster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## [[software_and_ai_capabilities | AI Capabilities]] and Interaction

The Humane AI Pin is designed as an [[software_and_ai_capabilities | AI assistant]] that is always by the user's side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### Voice Commands and Multimodal AI
The device does not use a wake word; the microphone activates and listens only when touched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Users can ask it questions, which are sent to "the Cloud" for processing and response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

It is also multimodal, meaning it can use its camera to perceive and interact with the surrounding world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. When asked what it sees, it scans the room, takes an image, sends it to the [[software_and_ai_capabilities | AI]] Cloud for analysis, and then provides a description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

The pin can also take pictures and up to 15-second videos, which are automatically uploaded while charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. A notable feature is its two-finger gesture for real-time translation, which auto-detects languages and translates speech back and forth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. It can also make phone calls and send text messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### Projector Interface
For situations where voice interaction is unsuitable (e.g., loud or private areas), the device features a laser projector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Activated by holding a finger out, the UI is projected in green 720p onto the user's palm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Interaction uses movement gestures tracked by a time-of-flight sensor:
*   **Rolling a marble:** To select items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **Pinching:** To select <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   **Making a fist:** To go back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Pushing forward:** To move deeper into a menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

The 3D UI, while new, is described as relatively intuitive after a brief lesson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. An example is the unlock mechanism, which involves moving a hand through space to select numbers like a Rolodex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Data Management
The pin can remember things the user tells it to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. All interactions, including call history, texts, listened content, answers to requests, and remembered items, are accessible through the "Humane Center," an online web portal (there is no dedicated app) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Functional Limitations and [[drawbacks_of_the_humane_ai_pin | Drawbacks]]

The device is generally described as performing poorly across most of its functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

### [[software_and_ai_capabilities | AI]] Performance and Accuracy
Many requests to the [[software_and_ai_capabilities | AI]] are slow, as they require sending queries to the Cloud and waiting for responses, leading to significant delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. The [[software_and_ai_capabilities | AI]] is also frequently inaccurate, prone to hallucinating, misunderstanding commands, or providing incorrect information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Server timeouts due to poor internet connections further exacerbate these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. While simple queries like time or battery life are fast, most other functions involve Cloud processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

### Battery and Heat Issues
Battery life is a major concern, being inconsistent and generally very poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Users must constantly manage and swap out booster batteries multiple times a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. The pin can drain an entire booster battery in as little as two hours even with minimal use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. The device is also consistently warm to the touch, and it has frequently overheated, requiring the user to wait for it to cool down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. This heat generation is linked to the inefficiency of wireless charging through clothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

### Physical Design and Wearability
Despite its impressive build quality, the pin's weight is a drawback, causing it to sag on lighter fabrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. This constant warmth and weight make it impossible to forget the device is being worn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. The notification light's placement on the corner means it is often out of the user's peripheral vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Its optimal wearing position can also conflict with seatbelts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

### Missing Basic Features and App Ecosystem
The Humane AI Pin lacks many basic functions typically found on smartphones, such as setting timers or alarms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Crucially, there are "no apps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. While it syncs with Apple, Google, Microsoft for contacts and Tidal for music (as the exclusive music partner), it has no access to services like Uber, Spotify, WhatsApp, calendar, Gmail, Amazon, or flight booking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

### Media Capture Quality
Photos captured by the pin are described as "pretty bad," and videos are "even worse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. They have a square-ish aspect ratio, are very noisy, and are limited to a maximum of 15 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. The Humane Center web portal for syncing also randomly stops working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. The projector, despite being a technical achievement, is not very readable, especially outdoors, and its brightness diminishes with distance due to physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

## Standalone Design and [[comparison_with_humane_ai_pin | Smartphone Comparison]]

A significant [[drawbacks_of_the_humane_ai_pin | problem]] for the Humane AI Pin is the overwhelming capabilities of smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. The reviewer notes that everything the pin does, a modern smartphone does better, faster, easier, in higher quality, and overall better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. This includes taking pictures and videos, making calls and texts, and being usable in diverse environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

Smartphones offer quick access to Google, faster messaging, email, and a vast ecosystem of app experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. The process of sending a picture from the AI Pin, which involves sending a link to a web portal, is significantly more cumbersome than on a phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. The pin's slow responses often lead users to simply use their phone for answers instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

The standalone nature of the pin means it doesn't communicate with the user's phone, severely limiting its effectiveness as a personal assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. An effective assistant needs to know a user's schedule, routines, contacts, and preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>, much of which a smartphone already knows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. The pin having its own phone number creates separate messaging threads, further widening the gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

The theory behind this standalone design is that Humane envisions the pin as a powerful, independent device in the future, and they do not want to set a precedent of phone connectivity that they would later have to remove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. This current version is "hamstrung by its ideal future version of itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>, similar to how the Apple Vision Pro operates independently of the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

## Glimmers of Potential

Despite its significant flaws, there were rare moments when the pin performed exactly as intended, providing a glimpse of its potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>. An example includes hands-free note-taking while driving, where the pin quickly saved a memory that could be accessed later in the Humane AI Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>. The ability to capture unique first-person videos from the chest, while quality is poor, offers a frictionless way to record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.

The device primarily appeals to individuals who wish to minimize their screen time and reduce reliance on smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. For such users, the pin represents a "glimmer of hope" for a future with less screen interaction and more living in the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>.

## Conclusion

Ultimately, the Humane AI Pin introduces too much friction and annoyance to be practical for daily use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>. The reviewer explicitly advises against purchasing the product in its current state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. While acknowledging and respecting the attempt by Humane to create a genuinely new product, it is clear the device has a "long way to go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>, even with a shared roadmap that includes future features like number sharing without specific dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.

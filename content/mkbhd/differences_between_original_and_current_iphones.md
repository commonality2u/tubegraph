The original iPhone, launched in 2007, holds a unique position in the world of classic technology, particularly for collectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. While most old tech pieces aren't highly sought after, a factory-sealed, unopened original iPhone is the number one most desired piece of tech in the collector's market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Rarity and Value
Finding a working original iPhone can be challenging, as the further back in time you go, the harder it is to locate a functional device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. However, discovering one that is still factory-sealed, never opened, and untouched by human hands is exceedingly rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This rarity has led to a significant difference in value between a used original iPhone and a new, sealed one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Unfortunately, this high value has also led to scams where used original iPhones are re-sealed and sold as new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

Only about 6 million first-generation iPhones were sold, meaning the number of unopened units will only decrease over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Recent auction prices for factory-sealed original iPhones highlight their fluctuating value:
*   February: Over $60,000 (record at the time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>
*   March: $55,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
*   Recent auction: $40,000 (for a model with a "lucky you" sticker) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>

The "lucky you" sticker seen on some models remains a mystery, as even Apple employees don't seem to know its meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## Distinctive Features Compared to Modern iPhones
Many features of the original iPhone stand in stark [[Significant technological advancements in iPhones | contrast to current iPhone models]]:
*   **No App Store** The original iPhone did not have an App Store, meaning users were limited to the pre-installed applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **No Custom Wallpapers** With the first version of iOS, users could not set custom wallpapers; every iPhone looked identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Activation Process** Activating a 1.0 iPhone past the iTunes boot screen can be surprisingly difficult, even with an old version of iTunes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   **Charging and Power** A 16-year-old battery typically won't turn on without charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Interestingly, the original wall brick and cable might not charge the phone if left overnight, but replacing only the brick can enable charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   **SIM Card and Ejector Tool** The original iPhone did not include a SIM card ejector tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. It came with a gigantic original-size SIM card (before micro and nano SIMs became standard), as it was an AT&T Singular exclusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   **Included Accessories** The original iPhone shipped with several items now absent from modern iPhone boxes:
    *   USB-A wall brick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>
    *   30-pin dock with a headphone jack out on the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>
    *   USB-A to 30-pin charging and data cable for plugging into iTunes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>
    *   EarPods (white headphones) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>
    *   A black microfiber cloth with the iPhone logo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>
    *   Apple stickers, which were sometimes slightly askew in the packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>

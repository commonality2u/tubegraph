The [[iPhone 13 Pro screen improvements | iPhone 13 Pro]] and 13 Pro Max feature significant camera advancements, marking a substantial upgrade over previous models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. Both models share the exact same camera setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>, with the only differences between them being screen size and battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

The camera system represents a "big leap up" for the Pro phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>, featuring a massive, three-layer camera bump that sits higher and causes the phone to rock more on a table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>. This is a noticeable change from the [[iPhone 14 Pro camera enhancements | iPhone 12 Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>, indicating much larger sensors and cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>. The phones still feature triple cameras, LiDAR, a mic, and a flash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>, with each camera being improved compared to the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.

## Camera System Components

### Primary 12 Megapixel Camera
The main 12-megapixel camera includes an even larger sensor and sensor-shift stabilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. It offers remarkable consistency across various indoor and outdoor lighting scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>. Users can choose from "photographic styles," with "Rich Contrast" being a noted favorite for most photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.

A key improvement is the "big sensor look," previously exclusive to the Pro Max <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>. This allows for easier natural bokeh, though it might require tapping to focus to ensure the correct subject is sharp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. The natural background blur is significantly improved and is considered superior to artificial portrait mode blur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. It also avoids fringing, an issue seen with some other large smartphone sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>.

### Telephoto Camera
The telephoto camera is also improved this year with a bigger sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. It now offers a 3x optical zoom, an increase from the 2x or 2.5x of the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. The quality is nearly on par with the main sensor, promoting confidence in switching between cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>. However, its digital zoom capabilities are limited; it struggles with deep double-digit zooming, maxing out at 15x where images appear like a watercolor painting, unlike phones with periscope zooms that maintain crispness at 10x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.

### Ultra-Wide Camera
The ultra-wide camera has improved its corner-to-corner sharpness, nearly matching the main camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>. While a higher resolution (e.g., 16-24 megapixels) would have been beneficial for true matching sharpness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>, its photos and videos are considered "world-class," among the best ultra-wides in any smartphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>.

A new capability for the ultra-wide is macro photography, unlike the base iPhone 13 and 13 mini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>. It can focus as close as 2 cm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>. While there might be some chromatic aberration and fringing, tapping to focus yields good close-ups in the center, far surpassing typical 2-megapixel macro cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>.

However, the automatic switching to macro mode when an object is within 14 cm of the camera without user control or notification is noted as an annoying aspect, as it often produces a "worse looking photo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>. Apple has stated plans to add a toggle to manually exit macro mode via a software update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>.

## Video Capabilities

### Cinematic Video Mode
The iPhone 13 Pro includes Cinematic video mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>, which is described as a 1080p 30fps HDR video portrait mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>. While useful for "focus racking" in a shoot, it is not considered the ideal solution for achieving the best possible videos on the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>. For optimal video quality, using regular video mode or third-party apps is still recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>.

### ProRes Video (Forthcoming Update)
The Pro iPhones are expected to receive ProRes video support via a software update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>. ProRes is a high-quality video codec used in professional industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>. This feature will allow shooting ProRes video from the phone, mixing it with other cameras, and editing it professionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>.

There are some limitations:
*   ProRes video will be 4K 30fps on all Pro iPhones except the 128GB base storage versions, which will max out at 1080p 30fps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>.
*   This limitation might be due to rapid storage consumption (4K ProRes files are about 6GB per minute) or potentially slower storage in lower-tiered models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>.
*   Users intending to shoot 4K ProRes video will need at least a 256GB storage version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>, with options up to 1TB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>.
*   Offloading large ProRes files via Lightning cable is a significant bottleneck, taking an "awful" amount of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>, highlighting the absence of USB-C or Thunderbolt on iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a>.

## Other Camera-Related Notes
*   There is still no astrophotography mode, though stars can sometimes be captured in Night Mode if the phone is held still long enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>.
*   A "Pro mode" for manual control over photos or videos is still absent, requiring third-party apps for advanced settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>.

Overall, the [[camera improvements in iPhone 15 series | iPhone 13 Pro cameras]] represent a solid upgrade, demonstrating Apple's strategy of iterative improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>.

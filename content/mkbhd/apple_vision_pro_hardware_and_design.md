The [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | Apple Vision Pro]] is described as one of Apple's most radical products, effectively a high-end virtual reality (VR) headset, though Apple refers to it as "spatial computing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. It shares a familiar form factor with other VR headsets, featuring displays, lenses, speakers, fans, and buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Construction and Materials
The [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | Vision Pro]] is constructed from metal and glass, which contributes to its high-quality feel but also its weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. It features a precisely machined aluminum frame around the outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The design includes intakes for fans at the bottom and vents at the top to manage heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

On the right side of the headset is a Digital Crown, which can be pressed or turned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The left side has a single, larger button, similar to the two buttons found on an Apple Watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

Speakers are integrated into small pods with downward-facing grills on the band, pointed directly at the wearer's ears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. While effective, they allow some sound bleed to those nearby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

The front of the headset is dominated by a large piece of glass, which is prone to fingerprints and smudges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Behind this glass is an outward-facing OLED display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Internal [[components_and_accessories_of_apple_vision_pro | Components and Sensors]]
The [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | Vision Pro]] is equipped with a comprehensive array of sensors:
*   **Outward-facing sensors:** Positioned around the front, sides, and bottom, these include depth sensors, infrared illuminators, lidar scanners, and regular RGB cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Internal sensors:** Located inside the headset, these sensors face the wearer's eyes, tracking them in real-time for eye control and for displaying a representation of the eyes on the outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

All this data is processed by an M2 chip and an R1 chip inside the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The R1 chip is specifically noted for processing passthrough video and adjusting shutter speed for lighting conditions, keeping latency under 12 milliseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

## Weight and Comfort
Weighing 638 grams with the solo knit band, the [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_specifications | Vision Pro]] is noted as a "pretty heavy computer to wear on your face" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. While slightly lighter than the Meta Quest Pro, the [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | Vision Pro]]'s weight distribution is concentrated at the front, as its battery is external <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## Battery Design
The [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | Vision Pro]]'s battery is external, a deliberate design choice that removes weight from the headset itself, allowing the wearer to lean back more easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. However, this means a cable runs from the battery to the headset, and the headset itself is heavily front-weighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

The battery has a surprisingly small capacity of 3,366 milliamp-hours compared to typical battery banks of its size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. It comes with a non-removable four-foot cable and a proprietary connector that twists and locks securely to the headset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. The battery glows when connected and starts booting the headset, which takes under a minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

There is no on/off button on the headset; to turn it off, the cable must be unplugged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Battery life is typically two to four hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. For longer use, the battery must be plugged into a USB-C power source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. The USB-C port is on the same side as the non-removable cable, likely encouraging users to keep the battery in a pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Lack of Physical Controllers
Unlike many VR headsets, the [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | Apple Vision Pro]] does not come with physical controllers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. While it supports external game controllers, mice, and keyboards, its primary input method relies on the user's eyes and hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

## External Display (EyeSight)
The outward-facing OLED display on the front of the headset is a unique [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | design]] feature. It is behind a lenticular film, which gives the illusion that the displayed eyes are sunken into the headset, appearing on the wearer's actual face rather than simply on the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. This feature, known as EyeSight, aims to indicate whether the wearer can see the outside world (eyes shine through) or is fully immersed (covered by a blue/purple glow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. The eyes displayed are a digital representation (Persona) created by internal sensors tracking the wearer's real eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. The visibility of the Persona's eyes on the outside can be subtle, especially for darker skin tones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>.

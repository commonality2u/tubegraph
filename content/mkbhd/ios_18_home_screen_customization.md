With the release of iOS 18, new customization options have been introduced for the iPhone Home Screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This update allows for more personalization, building upon features previously introduced such as [[using_widgets_on_ios_14 | widgets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

## Icon Placement and Arrangement

A significant change in iOS 18 is the ability to place icons anywhere on the Home Screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. While icons still snap to a grid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, users can now position them on the right or bottom of the screen, making them more reachable without automatically snapping back to the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

## Customization Menu

To access the Home Screen customization menu, users can hold down anywhere on the Home Screen, tap the "edit" button at the top, and then select "customize" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

The menu includes several options:

*   **Dark Mode**: Tints the wallpaper darker and sets icons that support a dark mode version to dark mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   **Light Mode**: The opposite of dark mode, it tints the wallpaper light and sets icons to their light versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Both dark and light modes can be set to automatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   **Large Icons**: A button is available to make all icons larger while simultaneously removing their text labels, which can result in a clean appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

## Tinted Icons

A new "tinted" option allows users to color all Home Screen icons to a single, matching color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, potentially to match the wallpaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. A color picker tool is also included to select an exact color from the wallpaper for the tint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

However, the effectiveness of this tinting varies:
*   Some app icons, particularly those with simple, high-contrast designs (including some Apple apps and third-party apps), appear fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   Apple [[using_widgets_on_ios_14 | widgets]] like the Weather widget can look good with accent colors, maintaining readability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   Other third-party app icons and [[using_widgets_on_ios_14 | widgets]] may become completely illegible, potentially requiring updates from developers to support this tinting feature with better contrast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. The intended standard seems to be a dark gray background with a tinted glyph in the middle, rather than the entire icon being tinted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

This tinting feature has drawn comparisons to Google's Material You in Android, which also faced issues with mixed monochrome and colorful icons when apps didn't support the theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

With the public release of [[New Home Screen Features in iOS 14 | iOS 14]], users can now extensively customize their iPhone home screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This new capability has brought a fresh excitement to phone customization, which has been available on other platforms for over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

Home screen customization in [[New Home Screen Features in iOS 14 | iOS 14]] can be approached at three distinct levels, catering to different user comfort and technical expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>:

## Level 1: Beginner

This level is for users new to home screen customization or those seeking simple improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
Traditionally, the iPhone home screen consists of rows of apps and folders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Incorporating Widgets
[[Widgets on iOS 14 | Widgets]] provide beautiful, glanceable information directly on the home screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
To add a [[Widgets on iOS 14 | widget]]:
1.  Enter "jiggle mode" by long-pressing an empty area of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
2.  Tap the plus (+) icon in the corner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
3.  Select from Apple's built-in widgets, such as the Weather or Battery widget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
    *   The Battery widget can monitor the battery levels of an Apple Watch, iPhone, and connected Bluetooth headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. It provides information at a glance but is not clickable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### Utilizing the App Library
[[New Home Screen Features in iOS 14 | iOS 14]] introduces the App Library, allowing users to remove unnecessary app icons or folders from their main home screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

2.  Tap the dots at the bottom of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
3.  Uncheck the pages you wish to hide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
Hidden pages are saved and can be brought back at any time, allowing for customized layouts, such as a "weekend home screen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

> It's possible to configure your primary home screen to display only the dock, with no other app icons, for a minimalist aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Level 2: Enthusiast

This level involves using [[Thirdparty widgets for iOS 14 | third-party widgets]] and exploring more advanced [[Widgets on iOS 14 | widget]] customization options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Developers are creating dedicated [[Widgets on iOS 14 | widget]] apps to provide beautiful, functional, and glanceable information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### Popular Third-Party Widget Apps
*   **Timepage**: Offers a minimalist weather widget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Hayweather**: Provides various sizes and customization options for weather widgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Google Widget**: A larger widget that includes a quick search bar, voice search, incognito text search, and Google Lens functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Color Widgets**, **Widgery**, and **Widgetsmith**: These apps are specifically designed for extensive [[Widgets on iOS 14 | widget]] customization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

> [!IMPORTANT] Pricing of Third-Party Widgets
> Many [[Thirdparty widgets for iOS 14 | third-party widget]] apps offer basic customization for free, but advanced features, specific colors, or functions may require a one-time purchase or a subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

## Level 3: Former Android User (Full Tilt Customization)

This level involves the most advanced customization, including custom icons and color themes, often seen in impressive home screen setups online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### Custom Icons via Siri Shortcuts
While [[New Home Screen Features in iOS 14 | iOS 14]] doesn't natively support custom app icons, this can be achieved using Siri Shortcuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
To create a custom icon shortcut:
1.  Open the Siri Shortcuts app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
2.  Tap the plus (+) icon to create a new shortcut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
3.  Add an "Open App" action and choose the desired app (e.g., Camera) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
4.  Tap the three dots (...) at the top right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
5.  Select "Add to Home Screen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
6.  Customize the icon's name and choose an image from your photos or files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

> [!TIP] Clean Icon Look
> The name field for the shortcut icon can be left blank for a cleaner appearance on the home screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### Downsides of Shortcut Icons
*   **Launch Delay**: Every time a custom shortcut icon is tapped, it first opens the Siri Shortcuts app before launching the target app, causing a brief delay (approximately 0.25 to 0.5 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. This delay is consistent and does not improve over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **No Notification Badges**: Custom shortcut icons do not display the red notification badges that native app icons do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This makes it impractical to have an entire home screen filled with such shortcuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

Despite these limitations, users are creating impressive color-coded and themed home screens using [[iOS 18 Home Screen Customization | icon packs]] or personal photos for shortcuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

These three levels demonstrate the range of customization possibilities currently available on [[New Home Screen Features in iOS 14 | iOS 14]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. While some features have been available on other platforms for years, [[New Home Screen Features in iOS 14 | iOS 14]] marks a significant advancement in customization for Apple devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

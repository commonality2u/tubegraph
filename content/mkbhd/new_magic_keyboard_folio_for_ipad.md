Apple has released a brand new, completely redesigned two-piece [[apple_magic_keyboard_case_features | Magic Keyboard Folio]] specifically for the 10th generation iPad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The reviewer expresses liking for most aspects of this accessory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## Design and Features

The [[design_and_build_quality_of_apple_magic_keyboard | Magic Keyboard Folio]] is a two-piece modular setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>:
*   **Back Plate** The first piece functions as a back plate that attaches to the iPad with magnets, acting as a kickstand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Keyboard** The second piece is a new keyboard featuring a full function row at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. The Smart Connector pins are located on the side edge of the iPad, allowing the keyboard to be easily attached or removed at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## User Experience and Utility

The [[user_experience_with_apple_magic_keyboard | two-piece setup]] offers both benefits and drawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Benefits
*   **Modularity** Being modular, it allows the user to switch to just a kickstand mode for watching media hands-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a> or add the keyboard when typing is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Comfort in Tablet Mode** When using the iPad in tablet mode while mobile, the keyboard can be flipped around so the buttons are not felt on the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

### Drawbacks
*   **Stability** The main drawback is that it is less suitable for lap use and is better suited for working on a desk or a more stable surface due to weight distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## Compatibility and Limitations

Despite its features, there are some puzzling aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>:
*   This new two-piece setup is **not available for the new [[ipad_pro_as_a_laptop_replacement | iPad Pro]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, even though a full function row would be beneficial for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. It is exclusively for the [[new_design_and_features_of_the_10th_generation_ipad | 10th generation iPad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   The [[new_design_and_features_of_the_10th_generation_ipad | 10th generation iPad]] does not support Stage Manager, which would have been useful for external monitor use and enhanced multitasking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Pricing

The [[apple_magic_keyboard_case_features | Magic Keyboard Folio]] is priced at $250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. When combined with the [[new_design_and_features_of_the_10th_generation_ipad | 10th generation iPad]] (starting at $450 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>), the total cost for the iPad with sufficient storage (bumping up from the baseline 64GB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>) and the keyboard accessory can reach $850 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. This combined price point is noted as being comparable to an [[comparison_of_ipad_pro_with_laptop | iPad Air]], [[ipad_pro_as_a_laptop_replacement | iPad Pro]], or even a traditional computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

The [[display_and_design_of_the_iphone_x | iPhone X]] is considered an iconic iPhone, feeling more modern and new compared to its predecessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. It introduces a learning curve due to fundamental changes in its usage compared to previous iPhones, which consistently featured a home button, rectangle screen, and rounded corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Design and Display Integration
The [[display_and_design_of_the_iphone_x | iPhone X]] maintains the familiar rectangle shape with rounded corners, but its display is the first to feature curved corners that push close to the phone's edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This design helps the iPhone catch up with 2017 phone trends of smaller bezels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### The Notch
A distinctive feature of the [[display_and_design_of_the_iphone_x | iPhone X]] is the notch at the top of the display, which houses all front-facing sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The notch is seen as either ugly or something users quickly stop noticing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. It is necessary to accommodate components like cameras, IR blasters, and depth sensors while minimizing bezels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. In everyday use, the reviewer found the notch to be unnoticeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

Apple has embraced the notch, promoting software and apps that wrap around it to fill the entire display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Apps need to be updated to a taller aspect ratio to optimize for the [[display_and_design_of_the_iphone_x | iPhone X]]'s display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Many major apps have already updated, but some still show large bezels at the top and bottom, resembling an [[iphone_8_display_features | iPhone 8]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

The only time the notch becomes a significant consideration for the reviewer is when watching full-screen videos, as it cuts off part of the display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Users can double-tap the screen to bring the video in, creating more bezels and making the video appear smaller, similar to an [[iphone_8_display_features | iPhone 8]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## Display Technology and Performance
The [[display_and_design_of_the_iphone_x | iPhone X]] features Apple's first OLED display in a smartphone, called a "Super Retina display" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

**Key display specifications and characteristics:**
*   **Size**: 5.8-inch panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Resolution**: High pixel density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Color**: Supports P3 color gamut and HDR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **True Tone**: Included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Brightness**: Not as bright or saturated as Samsung's Note 8 or S8 displays, but still sufficiently bright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Color Accuracy**: Colors are not too cartoonish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Viewing Angles**: Exhibits a small blue shift when tilted off-axis, a common characteristic among many OLED displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **3D Touch**: Still present, though the reviewer rarely uses it except for lock screen controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

The display is considered "awesome" and contributes significantly to the phone's overall appealing aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## Display-Related User Experience and Gestures
With the full-screen display, the [[display_and_design_of_the_iphone_x | iPhone X]] replaces the home button with a series of gestures, marking the biggest learning curve for any iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

*   **Go Home**: Swipe up from the bar at the bottom of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **Notifications**: Swipe down from the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Control Center**: Swipe down from the right corner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Multitasking**: Swipe halfway up and then over to access recent apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This method is faster than swiping up and waiting for cards to appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

Once accustomed, these gestures feel natural, to the point that the reviewer found themselves attempting to swipe up on other phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Reachability
The [[display_and_design_of_the_iphone_x | iPhone X]] still includes Reachability, found in accessibility settings, which allows users to swipe down on the bottom of the screen to bring top corners within reach, facilitating one-handed use for top gestures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

## Battery Performance
The battery life on the [[display_and_design_of_the_iphone_x | iPhone X]] is described as "pretty great," comparable to the [[iphone_8_plus_battery_life | iPhone 8 Plus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. iPhones are known for their excellent standby time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. The phone handles its large display well, partly due to the OLED technology, allowing users to comfortably get through a full day of use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. Screen-on time typically averages around six hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

The [[iphone_x_design_and_hardware_review | iPhone X]], pronounced "iPhone Ten" but commonly referred to as "the X" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, represents the future of Apple's smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. It introduced significant changes compared to previous models like the [[differences_between_iphone_x_and_iphone_8 | iPhone 8]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Display Features
The most prominent feature of the [[iphone_x_display_features_and_performance | iPhone X]] is its 5.8-inch OLED corner-to-corner display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This screen fits into a physical footprint smaller than the [[differences_between_iphone_x_and_iphone_8 | iPhone 8 Plus]], despite having a larger display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

Key characteristics of the display panel include:
*   **Brightness** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>
*   **Contrast** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>
*   **Calibration** (well-calibrated, not oversaturated like some OLEDs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>

A notable design element of the display is the "notch" at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, which houses the new front-facing camera suite including an IR blaster and depth sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. While some apps may initially be incompatible and require updates to properly handle the notch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, the overall experience with the display panel itself has been positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Design and Hardware
The [[iphone_x_design_and_hardware_review | iPhone X]] features a shiny, chromy, and reflective design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   The silver model has particularly shiny sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   The Space Gray variant is more toned down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

A major departure from previous iPhones is the absence of a home button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, resulting in an all-screen front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This design change necessitated the introduction of new gestures and button combinations for common tasks within [[ios_on_iphone_x_and_its_functionality | iOS on iPhone X]], such as:
*   **Going Home:** Swipe up gesture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Taking a Screenshot:** Pressing the power and volume up buttons simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Turning the Phone Off:** Long-pressing the power button and volume up key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Accessing Siri:** Long-holding the power button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Activating Apple Pay:** Double-pressing the power button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Multitasking and App Switching:** New gestures for navigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

The setup process for the [[iphone_x_design_and_hardware_review | iPhone X]] also changed, requiring Face ID setup during the first boot instead of Touch ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

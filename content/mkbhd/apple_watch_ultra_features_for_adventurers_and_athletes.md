The [[Apple Watch Ultra]] is designed for "the most extreme users" including adventurers, serious hikers, divers, marathon runners, and triathletes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. It offers extra premium features and specs that are considered "overkill for most people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>, but cater specifically to those on the "outskirts" for whom regular Apple Watches were insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

## Core Enhancements
Compared to the standard Apple Watch, the [[Apple Watch Ultra]] primarily adds three main things: ruggedness, features, and [[apple_watch_ultra_battery_life | battery life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:09">[03:08:09]</a>.

### [[apple_watch_ultra_design_and_build | Ruggedness and Design]]
The [[Apple Watch Ultra]] has been significantly beefed up to be much harder to break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>:
*   **Size** It is a bigger watch, measuring 49 millimeters diagonally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. It is visually massive but not as heavy as it looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
*   **Materials** It features a titanium case with a ceramic back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. The only color available is exposed titanium, which looks very silver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.
*   **Buttons and Crown** It has much bigger buttons that are easier to press with gloves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>, along with a bigger crown and crown guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
*   **Display Protection** The display uses a flat sapphire crystal, protected by a slightly raised lip around the screen to guard against corner impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

### [[apple_watch_ultra_battery_life | Enhanced Battery Life]]
The [[apple_watch_ultra_battery_life | Apple Watch Ultra Battery Life]] is a major improvement over other Apple Watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>.
*   It can last two full days and two full nights with plenty of battery to spare, which is roughly double the battery life of an [[apple_watch_series_7_features | Apple Watch Series 7]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. For example, after ultimate frisbee practices on Saturday and Sunday and sleep tracking, the watch still had 20% battery on Monday morning at 11 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   An upcoming battery optimization setting feature will further extend battery life during workouts by pinging GPS and heart rate less often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>. Apple states this setting can essentially triple the watch's life, up to 60 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>.
*   While a "massive improvement for an Apple Watch," its two-day battery life is not impressive compared to some other high-end watches that can last weeks, months, or even years without charging, such as the Casio Pro Trek with solar charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

### Specialized Capabilities
The [[Apple Watch Ultra]] includes additional features for enhanced performance in demanding environments:
*   **Audio** Extra microphones and speakers improve audio quality in windy environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.
*   **GPS** Dual-frequency GPS provides more accurate and reliable tracking in challenging settings like forests or cities with skyscrapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.
*   **Water Resistance** A WR-100 water resistance rating allows for submersion up to 100 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.
*   **Display Brightness** A 2000 nits max brightness makes the display the most visible outdoors among smartwatch OLEDs, also serving as a useful flashlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.
*   **Action Button** A bright, international orange-colored Action Button is customizable to perform one of eight functions, such as opening the workout selector, marking segments/laps, or indicating transitions in a triathlon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>.
*   **Siren** A super loud 86-decibel siren can be played from the new speaker system, audible from approximately a quarter-mile away, for emergency situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>.
*   **Wayfinder Watch Face** A new default watch face puts live compass and other relevant information at the user's fingertips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.

## [[target_users_for_apple_watch_ultra | Target Users and Use Cases]]

### Scuba Divers
For frequent scuba divers who previously used dedicated dive computers, the [[Apple Watch Ultra]] offers:
*   WR-100 water resistance up to 100 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>.
*   A new dive app for tracking basic metrics like depth and providing safety stop times for recreational diving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.
*   Partnership with a third-party company for the Oceanic+ app (coming later this year), which is expected to perform "basically everything that the pro dive computers do," including air integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. It does not monitor tank pressure or depth past 40 meters, which some extreme technical divers might require <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.

### Adventurous Hikers
For adventurous hikers who go off-path for miles, sometimes for days, the [[Apple Watch Ultra]] provides:
*   Dual-frequency GPS for more accurate and pinpointed navigation in challenging locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>.
*   A new compass app that allows setting unlimited waypoints for navigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.
*   A "backtrack" feature to track the exact walking path and guide the user back to where they started, especially useful in difficult visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.

### Ultra Endurance Athletes
For ultra endurance athletes who participate in Iron Man races, ultra marathons, and Spartan races, the [[Apple Watch Ultra]] addresses previous limitations in battery life:
*   Significantly improved [[apple_watch_ultra_battery_life | battery life]] capable of handling most extreme GPS-heavy endurance activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.
*   The dual-frequency GPS is "huge" for these activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.
*   The Action Button is also a valuable feature for these users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>.
*   The upcoming battery optimization setting in workouts will reduce GPS and heart rate ping frequency to extend battery life for very long events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>.

### New Bands
Apple also introduced a trio of new $99 bands specifically for these activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>:
*   Trail Band
*   Alpine Loop
*   Ocean Band

## Overall Use
The [[Apple Watch Ultra]] is "technically speaking the best Apple Watch they've ever made" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>, featuring the longest [[apple_watch_ultra_battery_life | battery life]], biggest and brightest display, best microphones and speakers, and most accurate tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>. While complete overkill for most, its advanced features for extreme activities also make it better for general use and media consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>. It can be a daily wearable, though its massive size might make it harder to "dress down" compared to regular Apple Watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>.

An exclusive look at the front glass of the [[iphone_6_display_and_its_features | iPhone 6]] in 2014 provided significant insights into its display technology. The part examined was an actual 4.7-inch front panel of glass, described as coming "straight off the assembly line" from Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Confirmation and Material
The existence of this part confirms that there will be an [[iphone_6_display_and_its_features | iPhone 6]] with a 4.7-inch display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Crucially, this 4.7-inch model is confirmed to feature a sapphire display, not just Gorilla Glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This debunked earlier speculation that only a larger 5.5-inch iPhone might receive a sapphire display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Advantages of Sapphire Crystal
Sapphire crystal offers several advantages over Gorilla Glass, which was used on the front of the iPhone 5S <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The two primary benefits are that sapphire is an "extremely high quality material" and "really durable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

Key characteristics include:
*   **Thinness:** It is "paper thin," literally the same thickness as a sheet of paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Clarity:** It is "perfectly see-through" with "0% opacity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Color Accuracy:** When looking through the panel, there is "how little distortion there is and how exact the colors stay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, with "absolutely no color shift" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Existing Apple Use:** Apple already utilizes sapphire in the iPhone 5S for the camera lens and home button due to its high quality, durability, and crystal-clear properties, which are essential for taking photos and reading fingerprints via Touch ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Durability and Clarity
The [[iphone_6_display_and_its_features | iPhone 6]] 4.7-inch display panel demonstrates remarkable durability and flexibility.

### Flexibility
The panel shows an ability to bend "a little bit," exhibiting "a little bit of torque, a little bit of flex, a little bit of give here and there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Attempts to seriously bend the display under human power suggested it was "almost impossible" to break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Scratch Resistance
Extensive scratch tests were performed using a knife and keys, applying significant pressure, far beyond typical phone use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Knife Test:** Applying "deep pressure" with a knife yielded "nothing" in terms of scratches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Keys Test:** Scraping and dragging keys across the panel with "a lot of pressure" also resulted in "nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Stab and Drag Test:** Stabbing the panel hard in the middle and dragging the knife point with "serious pressure" again showed "no results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
The tests concluded that "you don't need a screen protector here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, and it is "almost impossible to scratch this screen with any regular use" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The worst blemishes observed were fingerprints and dust from handling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Due to the display not being attached to a phone, drop or corner impact tests were not possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### Optical Quality
The sapphire material is noted for its "insanely clear" and "super high quality" properties, with optical clarity comparable to professional recording glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Source and Overall Impression
The parts, including the 4.7-inch sapphire glass panel and the home button part with the Touch ID sensor (which is the same size as the iPhone 5S's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>), were provided by Sonny Dixon, who has been reliable with Apple-related leaks in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. The overall impression is that this high-quality, clear, and durable sapphire front panel will be a significant feature of the new [[iphone_6_display_and_its_features | iPhone 6]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

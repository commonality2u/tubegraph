The [[Collectibility of factory sealed original iPhones | factory-sealed, unopened original iPhone]] is the most sought-after piece of tech in the collector world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. While finding a working, used original iPhone from 2007 is difficult, finding one that is still sealed and has never been opened or touched by human hands is extremely rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## The Problem of Scams and Value Discrepancy

The rarity and high value of unopened original iPhones have led to widespread scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. People will re-seal used original iPhones and sell them online as new, leading many YouTubers to spend thousands on what they believed were untouched devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The difference in value between a used original iPhone and a new, sealed, untouched one is "gigantic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The effort to re-seal an old iPhone to make it appear new is considered "well worth the price" due to this value gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Initial Verification Methods and Their Limitations

When purchasing an original iPhone from an auction, certain verification methods are typically employed, but they have limitations:

*   **X-rays:** Auction houses may provide X-rays of the package contents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. While X-rays can confirm that accessories are present inside the box, they cannot verify if these components are "untouched" or if the phone itself has been opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Serial Number Check:** Using Apple's checker for the serial number can show if the device has never been registered or activated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. However, this only confirms non-activation, not that the device has never been opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

Ultimately, verifying an unopened iPhone is largely a "trust exercise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

## Physical and Behavioral Indicators of Authenticity

Upon physical inspection, several details can help determine if an original iPhone is genuinely unopened:

*   **Overall Packaging Condition:**
    *   The outer packaging may show slight browning or minor breaks, which could indicate its age or reason for a lower auction price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
    *   An upside-down "lucky you" sticker found on some models is confusing and its origin is unknown, even to Apple employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Shrink Wrap Integrity:** The most convincing evidence is the condition of the shrink wrap. If it's "super old" and the inner shrink wrap around the iPhone itself is "perfect looking," it strongly suggests authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   **Device Condition:** The iPhone itself should appear "brand new" with a "fresh piece of metal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. There should be a hard plastic screen protector, which can be surprisingly difficult to remove on an original model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Included Accessories:**
    *   The phone should come with a microfiber cloth that says "iPhone" on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
    *   The Apple stickers included should be slightly askew, not perfectly aligned, which is a detail from the original packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
    *   All accessories (USB-A wall brick, 30-pin dock with headphone jack, 30-pin USB-A charging/data cable, EarPods) should still be sealed in their original packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
    *   The original dock should look "brand new" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
    *   The device should include a gigantic, original-sized AT&T Singular exclusive SIM card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. There should be no SIM card ejector tool, as this was not included with the original iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
*   **Battery and Activation Behavior:**
    *   A 16-year-old battery is not expected to turn on immediately; if it did, it would be a "pretty red flag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
    *   The original brick and cable might not charge the phone due to age; a newer brick might be needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
    *   A genuinely unopened 1.0 iPhone is surprisingly difficult to get past the iTunes boot screen and activate, even with an old version of iTunes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. This difficulty can actually lend credence to its unopened status, as later software versions on used iPhones might activate more easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

Despite these verification methods, the process remains challenging, and the value of an unopened iPhone dramatically decreases once it is opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

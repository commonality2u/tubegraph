The [[iPhone X design and hardware review | iPhone X]] was highly anticipated, representing what was considered the future of Apple's smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Despite the numerical designation, it is commonly referred to as the "iPhone X" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Unboxing Experience

The unboxing experience of the [[iPhone X design and hardware review | iPhone X]] is largely consistent with previous iPhone models, such as the [[iphone_7_unboxing_experience | iPhone 8]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The box includes headphones, adapters, and stickers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Initial Design Impressions

Upon unboxing, the silver [[iPhone X design and hardware review | iPhone X]] presents as a very shiny, chromy, and reflective device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The space gray variant, however, features a more toned-down aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Setup and New Features

The primary new aspect during the initial setup of the [[iPhone X design and hardware review | iPhone X]] is the configuration of Face ID, replacing the traditional fingerprint-based Touch ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Display and Notch
The most significant change in the [[iPhone X design and hardware review | iPhone X]] is its [[display_and_design_of_the_iphone_x | 5.8-inch OLED corner-to-corner screen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This larger display fits within a smaller physical footprint than the iPhone 8 Plus, despite the latter having a smaller screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Attention is drawn to the top notch and how applications adapt to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

The display panel is described as bright, contrasty, and well-calibrated, avoiding the oversaturation sometimes seen in OLED screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Some apps may be incompatible and require updates to function correctly with the new display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### New Gestures and Button Combinations
Without a home button, the [[iOS on iPhone X and its functionality | iPhone X]] relies on new gestures and button combinations for functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>:
*   **Go Home:** Swipe up gesture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Screenshot:** Power button + Volume up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Turn Off:** Long press Power button + Volume up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Siri:** Long hold Power button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Apple Pay:** Double press Power button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Multitasking/App Switching:** Various swipe gestures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

### Front-Facing Camera Suite
The new front-facing camera suite, located within the notch, includes an IR blaster and a depth sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This enables several new features:

*   **Face ID:** The setup process is quick and seamless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. It requires the user to look at the phone to unlock it, similar to the setup process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Face ID is designed not to unlock with a picture, when the user is looking away, or when their eyes are closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Selfie Portrait Mode:** The front-facing camera features a portrait mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Initial impressions suggest it is average compared to competitors like the Pixel 2, particularly concerning edge detection and hair details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The iPhone's portrait mode can be particular about lighting conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Animojis:** The front-facing camera also supports Animojis, which map the user's face to a cartoon animal head and can be sent via iMessage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. The physics of the moving Animojis are noted as being quite accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Further Review Considerations

The initial unboxing and hands-on experience reveal many aspects of the [[iPhone X design and hardware review | iPhone X]] requiring further testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Future reviews are expected to cover battery life, camera quality, and app performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

The Tesla Cybertruck, revealed four years prior to its near-final production model testing, has been an enigma, with initial prototypes seen in California and Texas [00:00:14]. The near-final version, which is representative of customer delivery trucks, offers a blend of futuristic [[Design and Features | design]] and practical utility, though some aspects require user adaptation [00:00:22].

## Dimensions and Maneuverability
The Cybertruck's overall dimensions have changed from the original show truck, being approximately 5% smaller in every dimension [00:03:11]. It measures about 224 inches from bumper to bumper, making it slightly smaller than a Ford F-150 Lightning [00:03:20].

Despite its size, the Cybertruck aims for surprising [[Performance and Limitations | nimbleness]] due to its unique steering system:
*   **Steer-by-wire system** This is a first for Tesla [00:29:08].
*   **Rear axle steering** It features up to 10 degrees of rear wheel steer in the opposite direction of the front wheels at speeds under 40 mph, effectively shortening the wheelbase and allowing for significantly tighter turns [00:29:18]. This makes it feel "way more nimble in parking lots" [00:30:06]. At higher speeds (above 40 mph), it shifts to turning one or two degrees in the same direction as the front wheels, enhancing stability during lane changes [00:30:18].
*   **Total turn radius** The entire steering radius is achieved in less than 180 degrees of wheel turn, which is unusual and takes "some getting used to" [00:29:27].

## Truck Bed (Vault) Features
The Cybertruck's bed is designed for utility:
*   **Dampened Tailgate** The tailgate offers a dampened opening but requires manual closing [00:08:29].
*   **Powered Tonneau Cover** It features a motorized tonneau cover capable of supporting up to 300 pounds of force, allowing a person to stand on it [00:08:42].
*   **Bed Liner** Unlike early prototypes, the production bed is fully lined with a "nice thick lining" based on feedback from construction professionals [00:09:55].
*   **Dimensions and Sub-Trunk** The bed measures approximately 66-72 inches in length (similar to an F-150 Lightning bed) [00:10:16]. A cool sub-trunk area is present, capable of fitting a duffel bag or carry-on, and includes a drain plug for use as a cooler [00:10:35].
*   **Power Outlets** The truck bed includes two 120-volt outlets and one 240-volt outlet, capable of delivering 9.6 kW of power, allowing for vehicle-to-vehicle charging or even theoretically powering a house with the right inverter [00:11:25].
*   **Convenience Features** Bed lighting and multiple latch points for securing cargo are included [00:10:57]. A bottle cap opener is also present [00:12:04].
*   **No Spare Tire** A spare tire is not included by default but can be purchased separately and tied down in the trunk [00:11:12].

## Exterior Design and Practical Challenges
The stainless steel construction presents unique considerations:
*   **Stainless Steel Body** The exterior is composed of "giant pieces of stainless steel," giving it a surreal, single-curve-free appearance [00:06:29].
    *   **Fingerprints** The stainless steel finish is prone to showing fingerprints, especially around the door opening areas, as there are no traditional door handles [00:14:29].
    *   **Panel Gaps** While the tested truck showed "pretty small, pretty even" panel gaps, the reviewer noted seeing other Cybertrucks with "slightly different levels of panel gaps, build quality in general," potentially due to the spring-back effect of stamping stainless steel [00:07:32].
*   **Door Handles** The Cybertruck lacks traditional door handles, using a button that pushes the door out about two inches when pressed [00:13:14]. Tesla claims it can break through up to an inch of ice to open, a claim that will be tested in colder climates [00:14:11]. The doors are frameless and open a full 90 degrees [00:13:34].
*   **Front Trunk (Frunk)** The frunk opens automatically [00:15:32]. It is relatively shallow, capable of fitting two carry-on suitcases with some arrangement [00:15:56].
*   **Windshield Wiper** It features "the world's largest windshield wiper," which covers a significant portion of the massive windshield [00:03:55].
*   **Side View Mirrors** While legally required to ship with side mirrors, they are removable [00:04:02]. Blind spot monitoring lights are inside the truck, and side cameras display the blind spot when the blinker is on [00:04:17].
*   **Wheels** The 20-inch rims come with removable plastic aero caps that provide a couple percent more range but can be popped off for aesthetics or off-roading [00:04:33].
*   **Front Features** The front includes a solid plastic bumper, two tow hitch rigs, and a front camera (a first for Tesla) which is useful given the truck's short nose and limited visibility over the front [00:14:57]. Headlights are narrow slots at the bottom, while a large daytime running light spans the front [00:15:15].
*   **Durability** The laminated windows are shatterproof, and the truck is "allegedly bulletproof" [00:32:01]. The body is "very, very stiff, torsionally stiff" and rigid [00:33:43].

## Interior Practicality and [[User interface and user experience | User Experience]]
The interior reflects Tesla's minimalist approach with specific adaptations for the Cybertruck:
*   **Steering Wheel** The steering wheel is a full wheel, not a yolk, and is the only curve in the interior [00:17:50].
*   **Glass Canopy** The vehicle boasts the "single largest piece of glass in the entire automotive industry" for its windshield and roof canopy [00:18:18]. Removable, magnetic sunshades are also present [00:18:41].
*   **Storage** Ample storage includes door bins for water bottles, tray storage, two wireless chargers, two cup holders, and a large center console armrest with a 120-volt outlet and a 65-watt USB-C port [00:19:00]. The glove box is a unique drawer opened via a screen button [00:28:10].
*   **Rear Visibility** When the tonneau cover is closed, rear visibility through the mirror is completely blocked [00:09:37]. Users must rely on a constant feed from the rear-facing camera displayed on the center screen, requiring a "muscle memory remap" [00:34:37].
*   **Backseat** The back seats offer "really good rear leg room" due to rectangular risers under the front seats [00:22:29]. The seats can also fold up for additional covered storage [00:22:52].
    *   **Rear Screen** A 9.5-inch screen for rear passengers allows control of heated left and right rear seats, airflow, and media [00:23:30].
*   **Vehicle Controls**
    *   **Steering Wheel Buttons** Unlike previous Teslas, buttons on the steering wheel (for blinkers, headlights, wiper, voice controls) are haptic and "actually clicks and moves" [00:24:27]. The horn is a traditional push-button on the wheel's center [00:25:03].
    *   **Hazard Lights** The hazard lights are a touch-sensitive button rather than a physical one [00:21:49].
    *   **Gear Selector** The gear selector (park, reverse, neutral, drive) is uniquely located above the driver's head, though it can still be controlled via the screen [00:21:54].
*   **[[Software and user experience | Software]] Interface** The 18.5-inch center touchscreen features a "Cybertruck UI" theme [00:25:28]. It allows real-time adjustments such as ride height (with 12 inches of suspension travel and up to 17 inches of clearance in off-road mode) [00:26:14]. The car's on-screen model also reflects real-time actions like windows rolling down or the steering wheel turning [00:26:50]. Drive modes (Comfort, Standard, Beast) and individual adjustments for acceleration, ride, and handling are available [00:28:27].

## Driving Impressions and Practical Considerations
The driving experience is distinctive:
*   **Performance** The triple motor "Beast" version offers instant throttle response, achieving 0-60 mph in 2.7 seconds with 845 horsepower [00:01:51]. This makes it "the fastest production pickup truck factory ever" [00:02:09].
*   **Ride Quality** The suspension is adjustable, with a "large delta" between firm and soft settings. The rigid body means suspension handles most of the ride quality [00:33:31].
*   **Cabin Noise** Despite laminated windows, some road noise from the all-terrain tires is noticeable [00:37:00].
*   **Visibility** The short nose and vast distance to the windshield make it challenging to see the front of the truck [00:33:01].
*   **Charging Architecture** The Cybertruck uses an 800-volt architecture, allowing faster charging at V4 Superchargers and reduced wire weight [00:36:26]. It also has a 48-volt low voltage system [00:36:44].
*   **Range Extension** An optional add-on battery that fits in the truck bed can extend the range by 120 miles, useful for long road trips, towing, or hauling [00:37:37].

### Summary of Practicality
The Cybertruck's greatest strengths include its immense power and responsive, nimble steering facilitated by rear-axle steering [00:38:00]. However, its polarizing aesthetics and higher-than-expected price (starting around $100,000 for the triple motor version) [00:02:21] are potential drawbacks for some consumers [00:38:42]. While not a full review, initial impressions suggest it is a "solid" vehicle, but its unique features will require adaptation for new users [00:39:34].

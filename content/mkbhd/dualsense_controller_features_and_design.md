The [[dualsense_controller_features_and_functionalities | DualSense wireless controller]] is presented as a significant improvement over its predecessor, arriving in a "stormtrooper white color scheme with blue accents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## Design and Aesthetics

The controller maintains the white and black aesthetic of the [[playstation_5_design_and_aesthetics | PlayStation 5]] console itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Upon first impression, the [[design_and_features | DualSense controller]] is described as "really nice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a> and a "pretty huge win" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

Key [[design_and_features | design]] aspects include:
*   **Size and Feel** It is notably "bigger" and "more solid" than the PS4 controller, fitting "well" in the hands and feeling "higher quality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The stems are "a little bit longer," making it "more comfortable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, yet it remains "really lightweight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Texture** A subtle but notable design element is the texture on the back of the controller. It is composed of "tiny little shapes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, specifically "embossed x's and o's and squares and triangles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, which provide grip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

## Functionality and Features

The button layout on the [[dualsense_controller_features_and_functionalities | DualSense controller]] is "basically exactly the same" as previous PlayStation controllers, featuring triangle, square, circle, and X buttons on the right, arrows on the left, a trackpad in the middle, and dual joysticks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

Other features include:
*   **Battery** It features a "built-in rechargeable 1500 milliamp hour battery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>, eliminating the need for a removable back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Charging** Charging is handled via a USB Type-C port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Haptic Feedback and Triggers** The controller boasts "haptic feedback" and "new improved triggers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, which are noted as being "a little more firm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Audio** A microphone is present at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, alongside a speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a> and a headphone jack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **LED Light** Unlike previous iterations, the LED light is no longer on the back of the controller but is now positioned "behind the track pad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Charging Pins** Pins located "on either side of the headphone jack" at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a> are dedicated to "docked charging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## DualSense Charging Station

Sony also offers a [[playstation_5_accessories_overview | DualSense charging station]], which allows for the simultaneous charging of two controllers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

*   **Components** The charging station includes the dock itself, a "pretty long power cable," and a brick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **Charging Mechanism** Controllers are placed upright onto the dock, aligning their pins with those on the charger, making them "pop right on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. The charging LED color behind the trackpad indicates charging status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Benefits** This accessory frees up USB ports on the console's front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   **Design Feedback** While the "click in is very satisfying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>, it was noted that the dock could be heavier for a more solid feel, and magnetic alignment (like MagSafe technology) would be an improvement for future iterations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

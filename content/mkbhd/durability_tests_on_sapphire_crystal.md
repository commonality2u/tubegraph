The front glass of the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 model, an actual part from the assembly line, includes a sheet of sapphire crystal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This confirms that the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 will feature a sapphire display rather than just Gorilla Glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, dispelling earlier speculation that only a larger 5.5-inch model would incorporate sapphire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

Sapphire crystal offers several advantages over [[sapphire_crystal_vs_gorilla_glass | Gorilla Glass]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Primarily, it is an extremely high-quality material and exceptionally durable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. It is paper-thin, yet perfectly clear with 0% opacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Apple already utilizes sapphire in the iPhone 5S for its camera lens and home button due to these properties, ensuring a [[quality_and_clarity_of_sapphire_glass | high-quality, crystal-clear material]] for optimal function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. When looking through the sapphire panel, there is minimal distortion and no color shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Durability Tests

To assess its durability, a series of tests were performed on the sapphire crystal panel:

*   **Flexibility Test**: The panel showed remarkable tolerance for bending, exhibiting a degree of torque, flex, and give <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Scratch Tests**:
    *   **Knife Test**: A knife was applied with deep pressure to the sapphire, but no scratches resulted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
    *   **Keys Test**: Keys were pressed down very hard and dragged across the panel, well beyond typical phone use pressure, yet yielded no scratches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
    *   **Stabbing/Dragging Point Test**: The panel was stabbed hard in the middle, and the point of a knife was dragged across the surface with serious pressure. Again, no results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

*   **Bending Test (Intense)**: Attempts were made to seriously bend the panel. Despite initial caution, it became clear it was "absolutely no way" to break or shatter the display under one's own power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The material is so tough that it felt like a rock could be dropped on it without damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

The worst "blemishes" on the surface after these rigorous tests were only fingerprint marks and dust from handling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Based on these experiments, it appears "almost impossible to scratch this screen with any regular use" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. This suggests that a screen protector would not be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Limitations

Since the sapphire panel was not attached to a phone with weight, formal drop tests or corner impact tests could not be performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## Conclusion

The sapphire crystal panel for the iPhone 6 demonstrates exceptionally high quality and clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Its extreme durability and resistance to scratches and bending suggest a significant advancement for smartphone front panels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

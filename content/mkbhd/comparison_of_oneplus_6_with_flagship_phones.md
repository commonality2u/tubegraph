The OnePlus 6, after two weeks of daily use, is considered "daily driver material" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> and is generally easy to recommend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Its review highlights the principle of the law of diminishing returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, where the benefit gained becomes less than the investment made as price increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The OnePlus 6 aims to cut price without sacrificing significant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, emerging as a "balanced budget performance beast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Price and Value Proposition
The most significant feature of the [[OnePlus 6 performance and battery life | OnePlus 6]] is its price, starting at $529 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This contrasts sharply with current flagships that typically cost $700-$1000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. While it's often "one small step behind" flagship smartphones, it "definitely beats any other $500 phone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, making it an "A plus for the price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

## [[oneplus_6_design_and_build_quality | Design and Build Quality]]
The [[oneplus_6_design_and_build_quality | build of the OnePlus 6]] is described as "legit awesome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, utilizing quality materials and construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
It features:
*   **Aesthetic Options** Midnight Black (matte), Mirror Black (glossier), and a Soft White version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Buttons** Clicky buttons and a firm, clicky alert slider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Form Factor** A solid feel with a "nice wedge shape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a> and plenty of metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Connectivity** A headphone jack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a> and a dual SIM card tray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Rear Design** A subtle S-shape in the frosted glass back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a> and a slight camera bump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Features and Conscious Omissions
To achieve its price point, OnePlus made specific choices to omit certain features common in higher-end phones:
*   **Storage** No expandable storage (microSD card slot), only dual SIM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Speaker** A single downward-facing speaker, which is the weakest hardware component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. It's average, can be tinny at high volumes, and lacks a second earpiece speaker for stereo sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Fingerprint Reader** Smaller than previous versions, reducing its surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Wireless Charging** Despite having a glass back, wireless charging is not included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. However, the excellent [[OnePlus 6 performance and battery life | battery life]] and fast Dash Charging mitigate this omission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Water Resistance** Not officially IP-rated (IP67 or IP68), though it is stated to survive daily splashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

### Performance and Battery
The [[OnePlus 6 performance and battery life | OnePlus 6]] features a Snapdragon 845 processor with up to 8GB of RAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a> and 128GB of storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. This hardware combination, along with a 3300 mAh battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a> and optimized OxygenOS, leads to excellent battery life, often achieving over six hours of screen-on time daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Dash Charging remains one of the fastest charging technologies available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### Display
The OnePlus 6 uses a 6.3-inch 1080p Optic AMOLED display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a> (2280x1080 resolution) with a notch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. While not as sharp as Quad HD displays found in the Galaxy S9 or [[Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro design and hardware | Pixel 2 XL]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, its 1080p resolution contributes to better battery life and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. It's considered the "best looking 1080p OLED in any phone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, with good brightness, color accuracy, and various display modes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

OnePlus cleverly handles the notch:
*   It can be hidden via display settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, utilizing the AMOLED panel's true black pixels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   By default, apps do not lose real estate due to the notch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>, unlike some early implementations (e.g., Essential Phone) or the [[Comparative analysis of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus | iPhone]] which can cut off YouTube videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Users must explicitly enable full-screen mode for apps to extend into the notch area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

### Software
OxygenOS on the [[OnePlus 6 performance and battery life | OnePlus 6]] is fast, smooth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, and stays close to stock Android while offering useful extra features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. These include:
*   Super fast facial recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   Gaming mode to prevent notification interruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   A new ambient display mode that activates when the phone is raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   The "Shelf" for quick access to useful information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

The [[OnePlus 6 performance and battery life | OnePlus 6]] was one of the first phones to be included in the Android P beta program alongside the Pixel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>, indicating good future update prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, likely better than Samsung or LG devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
A minor drawback is the new gesture navigation, which, while functional and intuitive, lacks the smoothness and responsiveness of [[Comparison of iPhone 11 Pro to previous models | iPhone]] gestures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

## [[OnePlus 6 camera features and quality | Camera Quality]]
The [[OnePlus 6 camera features and quality | camera of the OnePlus 6]] is rated as a "B-plus" compared to flagship smartphones like the [[Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro design and hardware | Pixel 2]], [[Comparison of iPhone 11 Pro to previous models | iPhone X]], and Galaxy S9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>, which are priced significantly higher. However, for its price point, it's considered an "A plus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a> and "definitely better than other $500 phones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

The primary camera is a 16-megapixel sensor with optical image stabilization (OIS) and an f/1.7 aperture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Photos are generally good, with fine focus, plenty of detail, low noise, and accurate, saturated colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. It tends to overexpose slightly, but dynamic range is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. The second camera is a 20-megapixel sensor without OIS, primarily used for depth information in portrait mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Portrait mode quality is decent but not outstanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

> "this is both literally and figuratively the most polished phone OnePlus has ever made" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>

The choices made by OnePlus in what to include and what to omit resulted in a "quality phone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a> that offers great value for its price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

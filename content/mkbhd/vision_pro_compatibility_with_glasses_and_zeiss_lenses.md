The [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_specifications | Apple Vision Pro]] is designed to accommodate users with prescriptions through the use of Zeiss optical inserts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43">01:43</a>. This allows individuals who wear glasses to still use the headset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50">01:50</a>.

## Zeiss Optical Inserts
Zeiss lenses are optical inserts that magnetically attach to the headset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48">01:48</a>. They are described as "really quite small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26">16:26</a> and utilize a strong magnet for attachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:55">16:55</a>.

*   **Cost:**
    *   Readers: Approximately $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22">16:22</a>
    *   Prescription lenses: Approximately $150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:24">16:24</a>

When attaching the lenses, a prescription lens can be snapped into place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49">16:49</a>. After attachment, users with a prescription are instructed to scan a code with the headset so that the device can recognize the prescription and adjust its display accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:59">16:59</a>.

## Integration and Fit
When purchasing a [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | Vision Pro]], users undergo a face scanning process using an iPhone's Face ID sensors to measure depth and scan around the eyes and face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04">07:04</a>. This process results in a custom-fitted [[vision_pro_light_seal_and_band_customizations | Light Seal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11">07:11</a>.

The [[vision_pro_light_seal_and_band_customizations | Light Seal]] is designed to roughly match the user's face shape to block out light and enhance immersion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33">07:33</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54">08:54</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00">09:00</a>. It is not exactly custom-molded but rather selected from a preset number of different sizes and shapes that best match the scanned data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38">07:38</a>. The [[vision_pro_light_seal_and_band_customizations | Light Seal Cushion]] also comes in thin or thick versions, allowing for further adjustment, such as positioning the headset slightly further from the face if optical inserts are used or if additional cushioning is desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17">07:17</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20">07:20">07:20</a>.

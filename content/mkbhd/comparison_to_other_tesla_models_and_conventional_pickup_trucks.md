The [[Tesla CyberTruck design and features | Tesla Cybertruck]] introduces a highly unconventional approach to pickup truck design, departing significantly from both traditional trucks and existing Tesla models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:37">[04:46:37]</a>.

## Design Differences

The [[Tesla CyberTruck design and features | Cybertruck]]'s aesthetic was unexpected, appearing like a "low poly count render" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:14">[01:53:14]</a> or a "fan made render" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:44">[01:59:44]</a>. Its design is described as "striking" and "huge," <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:48">[04:06:48]</a> with "angles" instead of the "curves" found on other Teslas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:41">[06:39:41]</a>. The cabin itself is shaped like a "triangle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:08">[06:43:08]</a>, and it features "bar headlights" and a "bar tail light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:09">[06:45:09]</a>.

### Exoskeleton and Bodywork
Unlike conventional vehicles, the [[Tesla CyberTruck design and features | Cybertruck]] features a "stainless steel exoskeleton" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:43">[02:29:43]</a>, making the entire body a single piece of metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:25">[02:42:25]</a>. This design makes the body "essentially bulletproof" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:06">[02:50:06]</a>. While the bodywork is considered challenging, it's noted as "not new for Tesla" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:08">[02:48:08]</a>, suggesting other Tesla models may also present unique manufacturing complexities.

### Interior Features
The interior of the [[Tesla CyberTruck design and features | Cybertruck]] prototype felt "very bare prototype feeling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:13">[04:28:13]</a>. Key elements observed include:
*   **Steering Wheel** A "yolk steering wheel" similar to the 2020 [[Tesla CyberTruck design and features | Roadster prototype]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:04">[04:33:04]</a>.
*   **Touchscreen** "Basically the same touchscreen as a Model 3 but with new graphics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:26">[04:36:26]</a>.
*   **Visibility and Space** "Tons of glass, tons of space, lots of headroom and foot room" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:04">[04:46:04]</a>.
*   **Ride Height** Passengers are "really high off the ground," requiring a "hiking up" motion to enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:04">[04:48:04]</a>.
*   **Rear View Mirror** A display showing the "rear facing camera" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:57">[04:53:57]</a>.
*   **Seating** It is a "six seater" with three seats in the front and three in the back, both bench style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:07">[05:00:07]</a>. This contrasts with most Teslas being 5- or 7-seaters with bucket seats in the front.
*   **Front Console** A "marble countertop like blank surface area in the front" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:42">[05:11:42]</a>.

## Performance and Capabilities

The [[cybertruck_specifications_and_performance | Cybertruck's specifications]] are highlighted as particularly impressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:05">[03:24:05]</a>.

### Towing Capacity
The top-tier triple motor all-wheel drive [[cybertruck_specifications_and_performance | Cybertruck]] will have a "14,000 pound towing capacity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:07">[03:44:07]</a>. For [[comparison_with_traditional_pickup_trucks | reference]], a 2024 [[performance_and_capabilities_of_the_ford_f150_lightning | F-150]] can tow approximately "half of that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:10">[03:49:10]</a>, showcasing the [[Tesla Cybertruck specifications | Cybertruck's]] superior capability in this area.

### Acceleration
While a single motor rear-wheel drive [[Tesla Cybertruck specifications | variant]] has a 0-60 mph time of 6.5 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:11">[03:30:11]</a>, the triple motor all-wheel drive option achieves 0-60 mph in just "2.9 seconds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:09">[03:38:09]</a>. This makes it "really fast for a pickup truck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:01">[05:42:01]</a>, outperforming many sports cars, let alone traditional trucks.

### Range
The top-tier [[Tesla Cybertruck specifications | Cybertruck]] is projected to have a "500 plus mile range" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:04">[03:42:04]</a>, a significant figure for any electric vehicle, especially a truck.

## Unconventional and Polarizing Design

The [[Tesla CyberTruck design and features | Cybertruck]]'s design is described as "unconventional" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a> and "one of the most polarizing automotive designs" ever seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:05">[07:52:05]</a>. It shares "pretty much no DNA from any other Tesla model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>, with the exception of the door handles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. Tesla could have chosen a more "cookie cutter design" like taking an existing Tesla model and transforming it into a pickup truck (similar to Simone Giertz's "truck'la" conversion of a Model 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:07">[06:05:07]</a>. Instead, "everything is rethought" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:07">[06:53:07]</a>, resulting in a design that some find "super badass" and reminiscent of a "Mars rover" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:03">[08:00:03]</a>, while others either "really like it or really hate it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:03">[08:06:03]</a>.

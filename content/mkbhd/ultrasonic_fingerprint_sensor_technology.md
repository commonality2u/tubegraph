The [[Samsung Galaxy S10 features | Samsung Galaxy S10]] officially transitioned to an ultrasonic under-the-glass fingerprint reader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:46">[02:35:46]</a>.

## How it Differs from Optical Sensors
Previously, under-the-glass fingerprint sensors, such as those found in phones like the [[OnePlus 6T | OnePlus 6T]], were predominantly optical. These optical sensors operated by shining a light onto the user's finger to read the fingerprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:17">[02:51:17]</a>. Ultrasonic sensors, however, do not use this light-based method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:07">[03:01:07]</a>.

## Advantages
The ultrasonic fingerprint sensor technology offers several benefits:
*   **Speed** They are faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:59">[03:03:59]</a>.
*   **User Experience** They do not require a bright light to illuminate the finger, making them less distracting or annoying, especially in dim light or at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:68">[03:05:68]</a>.
*   **Efficiency** They can read fingerprints and authenticate the user even before the display is fully woken up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:35">[03:12:35]</a>.

While the [[Samsung Galaxy S10 features | Galaxy S10]] and [[Samsung Galaxy S10 features | S10 Plus]] feature this technology, the [[Samsung Galaxy S10 features | Galaxy S10e]] uses a "regular" fingerprint sensor as part of its design trade-offs to achieve a lower price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:89">[06:47:89]</a>.

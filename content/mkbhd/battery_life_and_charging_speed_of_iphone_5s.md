The [[performance_and_hardware_specifications_of_iphone_5s | iPhone 5s]] includes a 1570 mAh battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This capacity is considered small compared to other smartphones, for instance, the Samsung Galaxy Note 3's battery, which is over 3000 mAh, is roughly the same physical size as the entire [[performance_and_hardware_specifications_of_iphone_5s | iPhone 5s]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Charging Speed
One notable advantage of the [[performance_and_hardware_specifications_of_iphone_5s | iPhone 5s]]'s smaller battery is its charging speed. The device charges very quickly, described as "lightning fast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Battery Life Performance
While charging is rapid, the [[battery_life_and_charging_capabilities | battery life]] during active use is not as long as other smartphones with larger batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

However, the [[Battery Life and Charging | standby times]] on the [[performance_and_hardware_specifications_of_iphone_5s | iPhone 5s]] are excellent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>:
> I could go to sleep with an [[performance_and_hardware_specifications_of_iphone_5s | iPhone]] at 100% battery not charge it and it would wake up with 97% battery. That's pretty good. An Android device with a similar sized battery might be at 80% when you wake up so that's pretty good that iOS takes good advantage of what it thinks you should be closing in the background when you're sleeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

Despite strong standby performance, the [[battery_life_and_performance_of_iphone_6 | battery life]] during actual use is not the best. It is even slightly worse than the [[battery_life_improvements_in_iphone_11_pro | iPhone 5]], performing about 5% worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. For users transitioning from a previous generation [[performance_and_hardware_specifications_of_iphone_5s | iPhone]], the [[battery_life_improvements_in_iphone_13_pro | battery life]] experience on the [[performance_and_hardware_specifications_of_iphone_5s | iPhone 5s]] will likely be consistent with expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Introduction to iPhone Cameras
Every new iPhone release features a slightly better, faster, and stronger device than its predecessor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Apple presents each new iPhone as "the greatest iPhone they've ever made" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. When assessing a new smartphone, the camera system often becomes the longest section of a review because of the advanced capabilities across many devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. The [[Camera improvements and capabilities | iPhone's camera system]] continues to be a differentiating factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.

## iPhone 12 Pro Camera System
The iPhone 12 Pro features a triple camera system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>, offering top-of-the-line performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. Users can expect good, consistent point-and-shoot photos and high-quality videos with excellent audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

### Camera Specifications
The core camera specifications have remained relatively consistent since they achieved high quality several years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>, meaning there isn't a huge year-over-year difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>:
*   **Main Sensor**: 12-megapixel, optically stabilized, with an f/1.6 aperture for ample light intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.
*   **Ultra-Wide**: 120-degree field of view, 12-megapixel, f/2.4 aperture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.
*   **Telephoto**: 2.5x optical zoom, f/2.0 aperture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.
*   **Additional Features**: A LiDAR scanner, microphone, and flash complete the camera array <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>.

### Ease of Use and Computational Photography
The iPhone camera is designed for maximum simplicity and ease of use, while still delivering sophisticated results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. The camera app is "dead simple" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>, allowing users to point, shoot, and tap to focus as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. Many advanced controls are typically hidden, requiring one swipe and a tap to access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.

The software performs significant processing via:
*   Smart HDR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>
*   Multiple exposures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>
*   Computational photography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>
*   A powerful image signal processor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>

This results in "consistent great results with minimal effort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>, producing "crunchy processed look" photos that are not over-sharpened, with good dynamic range and detail for their file size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. The iPhone prioritizes faces, brightening them even if they are in shadows, sometimes at the expense of other parts of the image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.

### Limitations in Manual Control and Zoom
Despite its strengths, the iPhone's stock camera app lacks a "pro mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>, limiting manual control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. While "ProRAW" offers more flexibility in editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a> and third-party apps can assist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>, a dedicated manual mode is absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>.

Compared to competitors, the iPhone camera can be outmatched in certain "edge cases" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. For example, the iPhone 12 Pro maxes out at 12x digital zoom, while some phones offer 10x optical zoom and triple-digit digital zoom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. Other phones may also have wider ultra-wide lenses or laser autofocus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>.

### Video Capabilities and App Support
The iPhone distinguishes itself as the best overall [[Camera performance and features | camera system]] in a smartphone due to its video capabilities and strong app support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. While video shot on a high-end Android phone can be comparable to the iPhone 12 Pro when using the native camera app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>, a significant difference appears when shooting video within popular social media apps like Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

For years, many apps with camera functions on Android phones simply screen-shotted the viewfinder instead of directly accessing the camera feed, as they do on iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. This gives the iPhone a development advantage, as developers can optimize one app version for millions of users, rather than many versions for various Android devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

### Dolby Vision HDR
The iPhone 12 series was marketed as the first set of Dolby Vision certified cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. While Dolby Vision HDR video from an iPhone looks amazing on the device itself and when shared with other iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>, compatibility issues arise when exporting or sharing it to other platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>. The iPhone's Dolby Vision video uses HLG (Hybrid Log Gamma), which is not universally compatible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>. If unsupported, the video converts to an SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) image, which may not look optimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>.

## Overall Camera Assessment
In summary, the iPhone cameras are generally "pretty good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>, particularly for point-and-shoot scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. The consistent performance and strong app ecosystem support for video make it a leading smartphone [[Camera enhancements and features | camera system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.

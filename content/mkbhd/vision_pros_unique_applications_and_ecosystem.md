The [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | ecosystem]] is considered the strongest argument for a regular person to purchase the current version of the [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | Apple Vision Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Many aspects of the [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | Vision Pro]] are specifically looked forward to because of their [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | ecosystem]] integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

## Core Apple Ecosystem Integration

Built-in [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | apps]] such as iMessage and Photos function perfectly, loading content directly from an [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | iPhone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. The [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | Apple Vision Pro]] is clearly the best headset for [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | iPhone]] users and those integrated into the [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | Apple ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Small but significant [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | features]] like Continuity allow users to copy text on a Mac or [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | iPhone]] and paste it directly into the [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | Vision Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

## Key Applications and Features

### FaceTime

FaceTime on [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | Apple Vision Pro]] is described as a unique "only Apple could ship this thing" experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
It incorporates:
*   Personas scanned from the headset's front cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   Positional tracking and responsive spatial audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

After the initial shock of seeing a virtual version of the user, the experience slowly becomes easier and feels more like a normal conversation than a typical FaceTime call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. While it sacrifices the ability to hold objects up to the camera, it offers a button to switch to a real-time first-person view, allowing the use of both hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Although audio from the speakers can bleed out if the volume is over half, the spatial audio still sounds impressive despite not being real headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

### Mac Virtual Display

The Mac Virtual Display is highlighted as the number one favorite [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | feature]] of the [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | Vision Pro]], even surpassing [[content_consumption_and_applications_on_apple_vision_pro | movie watching]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
> [!NOTE] Comparison
> While remote desktop viewing is available on other headsets like the Quest 3, the [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | Vision Pro]]'s implementation is "way more interesting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

It connects to a Mac and renders a new virtual display rather than just mirroring the computer's existing screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Users can utilize their Mac with its existing controls while making the virtual monitor literally as large as they desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Simultaneously, other [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | Vision Pro]] [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | apps]] can be opened and placed around the Mac display, floating in midair, over walls, or pinned to objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

Despite its advantages, there are trade-offs:
*   Inability to see a physical keyboard in an immersive environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
*   Limitation to a single virtual Mac monitor at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   The need to always look where you are controlling, involving extra brain cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

Despite these limitations, it remains the top [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | feature]] and a unique capability not found in other [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | Apple products]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

## Current App Landscape

As of launch day, there are 600 [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | apps]] specifically made for the [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | Vision Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. In addition, millions of [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | iPad apps]] are compatible with the headset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. The dedicated [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | Vision Pro]] [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | apps]] are noted for their creative use of 3D space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Current Weaknesses
> The current [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | app]] situation is considered a weakness of the first-generation product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.
>
> *   The home screen displays all [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | apps]] alphabetically and cannot be rearranged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.
> *   There are "way more cool ideas about VR and AR experiences than there are actual apps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.
> *   Notable absences include official [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | apps]] for YouTube, Netflix, Spotify, and TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

The hope is that [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | Apple]] can improve relationships with developers to bring these and other [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | apps]] to the [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | platform]], which would enhance the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. The launch of [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | Apple Vision Pro]] is expected to unlock a new creative layer for dreaming up new AR and VR experiences, with developers gradually bringing these concepts to reality within the constraints of current technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

The [[new_features_of_iphone_x_including_face_id | iPhone X]] introduces significant changes to its iOS interface and functionality, primarily due to the removal of the home button and the introduction of a new display design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This represents the biggest learning curve of any iPhone ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

### New Gestures and Navigation
With the absence of a home button, the [[new_features_of_iphone_x_including_face_id | iPhone X]] relies on a new set of gestures for navigation:
*   **Going Home** Users swipe up from the bar at the bottom of the screen at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **Notifications** Swiping down from the top of the screen brings up notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Control Center** Swiping down from the right corner of the screen accesses the Control Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Multitasking** To access recent apps in the card-style carousel, users swipe halfway up and then over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This method is faster than swiping up and waiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Reachability** This feature, which brings the top corners of the screen within reach for one-handed use, is still available in the accessibility settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

While these changes introduce a learning curve, they become natural after a few days of use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

### Display Integration and App Optimization
The [[display_and_design_of_the_iphone_x | iPhone X]] features a new edge-to-edge display with rounded corners and a "notch" at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **The Notch** The notch houses all front-facing sensors, cameras, an IR blaster, and a depth sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. While initially divisive, many users, including the reviewer, stop noticing it in everyday use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Apple has embraced the notch, promoting software that wraps around it and fills the entire display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **App Updates** Due to the taller aspect ratio and the notch, developers must update their apps to fill the display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Many major apps have already been updated, but unoptimized apps will appear with large bezels at the top and bottom, resembling an [[Differences between iPhone X and iPhone 8 | iPhone 8]] display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This is considered the biggest change developers have had to make for a new iPhone since its inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **Video Playback** The notch can be awkward when watching full-screen videos as it cuts off part of the display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Users can double-tap to bring the video in, which adds bezels but prevents content from being cut off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### Face ID
[[Face ID and facial recognition technology on iPhone X | Face ID]] replaces Touch ID as the primary authentication method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Performance** Face ID works reliably most of the time, although it's not as consistently perfect as Touch ID, with an estimated success rate of around 95% compared to Touch ID's 99% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. It can improve with software updates and increased usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   **Technology** It operates by projecting thousands of infrared dots onto the user's face to create a 3D map of the eyes, nose, and mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. It doesn't use the front-facing camera for authentication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   **Adaptability** Face ID can learn a changing face, recognizing users after haircuts, shaving, or applying makeup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. It cannot be tricked by pictures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a> and can work through some sunglasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   **Limitations** It can fail when the user is backlit or when there's excessive infrared light from the sun, which blinds the sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Like Touch ID, users will learn when to resort to a passcode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Seamless Authentication** Despite minor limitations, facial recognition is considered a more secure and seamless authentication method than a separate fingerprint reader, as users simply pick up the phone to unlock and use it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **Attention Aware** A setting allows Face ID to only unlock when the user is actively looking at the phone, which also ensures notification data is shown only when intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

### Animoji
A fun and exclusive [[new_features_of_iphone_x_including_face_id | iPhone X]] feature, Animoji uses facial tracking to animate emoji characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. These are exclusive to the [[new_features_of_iphone_x_including_face_id | iPhone X]], distinguishing users who send them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. Notably, Animoji primarily uses the front-facing camera and still functions even when depth sensors are covered, suggesting it could have been made available on other iPhone models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

### Performance and Battery Life
The [[new_features_of_iphone_x_including_face_id | iPhone X]] is powered by the A11 Bionic chip and 3GB of RAM, making it a highly powerful mobile chipset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.
*   **Chipset Capabilities** This power primarily supports advanced features like augmented reality (AR) apps, image processing, and super slow-motion video, rather than just the core iOS functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
*   **iOS Experience** While iOS feels more modern due to the new gestures, its core functionality and quirks remain the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. The notification system, for example, is still considered a "mess" as it doesn't group apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.
*   **Battery Life** Battery performance is comparable to the [[Differences between iPhone X and iPhone 8 | iPhone 8 Plus]], with excellent standby time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. The OLED display helps manage power consumption, allowing users to consistently get through a full day of heavy use, with screen-on time averaging around six hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

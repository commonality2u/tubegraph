The design approach for folding smartphones generally falls into two main categories: devices that fold with the screen on the inside (in-fold) and those that fold with the screen on the outside (out-fold) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. Experience with early models like the Royole FlexPai has provided insights into the advantages and disadvantages of each method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

## Out-Fold Designs (Screen on the Outside)

The Royole FlexPai, the first and only folding phone to ship in 2019, exemplifies the out-fold design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. Other devices like the Huawei Mate X also showcase this design philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>.

**Characteristics and Challenges:**
*   **Exposure:** The [[folding_screen_technology | flexible OLED panel]], which is the most delicate part, remains constantly exposed to the elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
*   **Thickness:** The device is thicker because its internal components cannot completely fold flat onto each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. This makes the phone chunky and difficult to fit in most pockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
*   **Creases:** Due to the outward fold, the screen typically has two noticeable creases, one on either side of the hinge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.
*   **Fold Radius:** The fold radius is significantly greater than zero, appearing more like a sharp curve than a true fold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.
*   **Ergonomics:** The act of grabbing the screen from both sides and folding it in half is described as incredibly awkward on the FlexPai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>.

**Example: Royole FlexPai Hinge Design**
The [[folding_phone_hinge_and_durability | hinge]] on the Royole FlexPai is notably covered in an accordion-shaped rubber material and screwed in on the sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. This design is not smooth to fold or unfold, sometimes making noises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. While the rubber may prevent debris from entering the [[folding_phone_hinge_and_durability | hinge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>, it also makes the phone resemble an accordion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. Concerns exist about this material wearing down over time, scratching, or ripping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. Unlike the [[Samsung Galaxy Fold design changes | Samsung Galaxy Fold]], there is no specified number of folds this mechanism is rated for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] The overall consensus is that folding with the screen on the outside "is not the way to go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>, especially given current challenges with screens and hinges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>.

## In-Fold Designs (Screen on the Inside)

The [[Samsung Galaxy Fold features and design | Samsung Galaxy Fold]] is a prominent example of an in-fold design, where the screen is protected when the device is folded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. The rumored Motorola RAZR is also expected to employ a similar inward-folding mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.

**Advantages:**
*   **Screen Protection:** The primary benefit of an in-fold design is that the flexible screen is tucked away and protected from external elements when the phone is closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.
*   **Crease:** The [[Samsung Galaxy Fold features and design | Galaxy Fold]] featured a "very slight crease" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>, which is considered less pronounced than the two creases found on out-fold designs like the FlexPai.

> [!NOTE] In the current state of [[folding_screen_technology | folding screen technology]] and [[folding_phone_hinge_and_durability | hinge]] durability, "folding in is gonna be the better way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Experience with early models strongly suggests that for the current generation of folding phones, an in-fold design is superior to an out-fold design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. Being the first to market with a new technology, as the Royole FlexPai was, does not necessarily translate to a better user experience if the design and implementation are flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>. The challenges presented by an exposed, outwardly folded screen outweigh the aesthetic appeal of a device like the Huawei Mate X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>. The in-fold design, as seen with the [[Samsung Galaxy Fold features and design | Samsung Galaxy Fold]], offers better protection and a more practical approach given the current limitations of [[folding_screen_technology | folding screen technology]] and [[folding_phone_hinge_and_durability | hinge]] durability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>.

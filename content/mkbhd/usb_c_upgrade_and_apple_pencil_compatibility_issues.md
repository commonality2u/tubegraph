The new 10th Generation [[baseline_ipad_updates | Baseline iPad]] introduces several updates, including a significant shift to [[usbc_integration_in_iphones | USB-C]], but this upgrade comes with notable compatibility quirks, particularly concerning the Apple Pencil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Design and Hardware Upgrades
The 10th Generation iPad features an improved design with flatter sides, the removal of the home button, and new, saturated colors like yellow, pink, and blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. It includes a Touch ID button on top for biometric unlocking and thinner bezels around a slightly larger 11-inch LCD screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Audio is enhanced with landscape stereo speakers, and camera capabilities are improved with a 12-megapixel rear camera (up from 8MP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Internally, it is powered by an A14 Bionic chip, an upgrade from the A13 in the 9th generation iPad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## The USB-C Transition: Benefits and Head-Scratchers
A major update for the 10th Generation iPad is the adoption of USB Type-C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This port allows for:
*   Plugging in USB-C flash drives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
*   Faster charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>
*   Connecting an external display, supporting up to 4K at 30Hz or 1080p at 60Hz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>

Despite the welcome [[usbc_integration_in_iphones | integration of USBC in iPhones]] and iPads, a perplexing issue arises with Apple Pencil compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The new iPad only supports the first-generation Apple Pencil, which infamously charges via a Lightning port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This necessitates a separate USB-C to Lightning adapter to charge the pencil, an adapter that costs nine dollars and comes in its own packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

This decision is puzzling given the existence of the second-generation Apple Pencil, which offers a superior charging method by magnetically snapping onto the side of compatible iPads like the [[ipad_pro_as_a_laptop_replacement | iPad Air]] or [[ipad_pro_as_a_laptop_replacement | iPad Pro]] and charging wirelessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### The Webcam Placement as a Compromise
The primary reason for this compatibility limitation appears to be the new placement of the front-facing webcam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The 10th Gen iPad is the first iPad to move the webcam to the long side (landscape orientation), which significantly improves the user experience during video calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. However, this new webcam housing occupies the spot where the second-generation Apple Pencil would typically attach and charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

Interestingly, the new M2 [[ipad_pro_as_a_laptop_replacement | iPad Pro]], released concurrently, also features a 12-megapixel ultra-wide webcam with Center Stage but keeps it on the short side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This suggests a perceived compromise by Apple: users can have either the improved landscape webcam placement or support for the second-generation Apple Pencil, but not both on the same device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

Some speculate that Apple's decision to maintain support for the older pencil aims to accommodate businesses and schools that might already own many ninth-generation iPads and first-generation pencils, allowing them to continue using their existing accessories upon upgrading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Conclusion
While the [[baseline_ipad_updates | new 10th Generation Baseline iPad]] brings welcome design and performance upgrades, including [[usbc_integration_in_iphones | USB-C]], the decision to retain support for only the first-generation Apple Pencil, requiring a separate adapter, is a perplexing choice. This seems to be a direct consequence of the repositioned landscape webcam, highlighting a [[separation_between_hardware_upgrades_and_software_features_in_apple_products | hardware design decision]] that compromises accessory functionality.

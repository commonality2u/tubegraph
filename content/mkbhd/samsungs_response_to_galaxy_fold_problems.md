Following initial issues with early review units, Samsung took proactive steps to address the problems with the [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Galaxy Fold]] before its wider release. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>

## Initial Problems and Recall
After the initial announcement in February, the [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Galaxy Fold]] began its press cycle later in the year, with a small number of review units distributed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a> One by one, including the reviewer's unit, these devices started breaking for various reasons. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>

In response, [[samsungs_response_to_galaxy_fold_issues | Samsung recalled all review units]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> They took the phones back behind closed doors to investigate what went wrong and to work on fixes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a> Despite initial skepticism and rumors that the phone would be canceled, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a> Samsung proceeded with the relaunch of a fixed version. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>

## Key Design Changes and Fixes
The updated [[samsung_galaxy_fold_design_changes | Samsung Galaxy Fold]] incorporated several subtle but important [[features_of_the_updated_galaxy_fold | design changes]]:

### Display Protection
*   **Integrated Protective Layer:** The thin layer that appeared to be a screen protector, but was actually part of the display, has been extended. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a> It now reaches all the way to the edges and is tucked underneath the display bezel. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a> This change prevents users from mistakenly peeling it off, as it is no longer physically possible to do so. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>

### Hinge Reinforcement
*   **Hinge Caps:** T-shaped caps have been added at the top and bottom of the display, right at the hinge. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a> These caps are designed to prevent dust or debris from entering the hinge mechanism. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a> The original [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Galaxy Fold]] had noticeable gaps in this area, which allowed debris to enter. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a> While these caps do not make the phone liquid or water resistant, they offer improved protection. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>
*   **Reduced Hinge Gap:** When the phone is closed, the gap created by the hinge is slightly smaller than before. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>
*   **Firmer Hinge Mechanism:** The hinge itself feels more firm, providing a more solid "snap" when opening and closing the device flat. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>

### User Warnings
*   **On-Screen Warning:** During the setup process, a new warning now appears on the screen. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a> This warning advises users to avoid pressing the screen hard, as the display is still made of a soft plastic material. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a> It clarifies that applying too much pressure, using fingernails, or scratching the protective layer can still damage the device. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>

## Samsung's Approach
Samsung's response is seen as positive, as the company acknowledged the issues, accepted responsibility, and worked to fix them internally. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a> No units were shipped to customers before these internal fixes were implemented. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a> This approach is contrasted with potential scenarios where a company might blame "user error" or proceed with shipping a flawed product. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>

> "I think it's a good thing that Samsung saw what was going wrong accepted it took all of them back they never actually shipped any to customers and fixed it internally and you know they actually addressed what was going wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>

The initial issues highlighted the challenges of developing completely new product categories, particularly when real-world usage scenarios differ from laboratory testing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a> Users perform actions not anticipated in lab environments, such as putting the phone in lint-filled pockets or taking it to sandy beaches. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>

While the fixed [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Galaxy Fold]] remains a delicate device that may still be susceptible to damage, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a> Samsung's commitment to fixing the issues demonstrates their belief in the foldable phone form factor. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a> The existence of the [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Galaxy Fold]] is viewed as a significant risk taken by Samsung in a market often characterized by more iterative phone designs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>

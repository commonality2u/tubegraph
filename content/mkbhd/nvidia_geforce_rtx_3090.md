The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 is introduced as the highest-end graphics card in Nvidia's new 3000 Series, described as a "gigantic huge graphics card" and the top of their new lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. It is highlighted for being capable of things that new consoles like the PS5 or Xbox Series X cannot achieve, specifically related to [[8k_gaming_capabilities | 8K gaming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Key Features and Setup
The RTX 3090 is built for [[8k_gaming_capabilities | 8K gaming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. It features HDMI 2.1 ports, which enable a single cable to output 8K resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. The video demonstrates an 8K resolution of 7680x4320 being achieved on a desktop with this card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

The GPU was tested within a custom-built Main Gear f131 computer, which included:
*   Intel Core i9 10900K (10 cores, 3.7 GHz base clock, turbo up to 5.3 GHz) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>
*   32GB of HyperX Fury RAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>
*   MSI MPG Z490 gaming motherboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>
*   1TB Samsung NVMe SSD (970 Pro) as the boot drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>
*   Another 2TB SSD for mass storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>
This system was connected to an 88-inch 8K OLED TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Forza Horizon 4
When playing Forza Horizon 4 at 8K resolution, the game was generally locked at 60 FPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. The visual detail, such as leaves on the ground and trees, and sky details, appeared "crisper" than at 1440p or 1080p <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. The game's highly detailed environments and elements, like individual snowflakes and water droplets with reflections, contributed to a more immersive experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

The GPU did experience occasional drops to around 50 FPS when there was a significant amount of activity on screen, with GPU utilization reaching 96% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. This highlights the demand of pushing over 30 megapixels per frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Cutscenes in Forza Horizon 4 appeared to be pre-rendered at lower resolutions (e.g., 1440p or 1080p) before switching back to 8K gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

### Control Ultimate Edition
In Control Ultimate Edition, the game was running at 8K with an average of 52 FPS while looking around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. However, when the in-game "render resolution" (which affects environmental detail) was set to 5K, the FPS dropped significantly to 21 FPS, indicating the GPU was heavily taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. Setting the render resolution to 4K resulted in 36 FPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, and it was suggested that 2K render resolution was necessary for the best experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. This demonstrates that even the RTX 3090 "is not invincible" and won't literally handle anything asked of it without frame rate compromises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. Despite this, the game's character and overall quality remained high, showcasing high-quality textures and realistic reflections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

## Conclusion
The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 is capable of handling "pretty much any game in pretty much any resolution," making [[8k_gaming_capabilities | 8K gaming]] a reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. While the card offers spectacular [[gaming_performance_in_8k_resolution | gaming performance in 8K resolution]] at high refresh rates or resolutions, the ecosystem for 8K gaming monitors is still maturing, with expensive 8K TVs being the primary display option currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. The RTX 3090 allows PC gamers to definitively claim that "the consoles can't do this," as it officially kicks out 60 FPS at 8K, offering a "glorious" and "beautiful" experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. The experience with this setup is considered "more than enough to be the right setup" for high-end [[gaming_performance_in_8k_resolution | 8K gaming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

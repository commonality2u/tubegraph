The [[comparison_of_oneplus_6_with_flagship_phones | OnePlus 6]] is described as "daily driver material" after two weeks of everyday use, indicating high user satisfaction for those who understand what they are purchasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Its most significant feature is its starting price of $529, positioning it as a "balanced budget performance beast" in a market dominated by much more expensive flagship phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Performance
The [[OnePlus 6 design and build quality | OnePlus 6]] features impressive specifications for its price point, including a Snapdragon 845 processor and 6 or 8 gigabytes of RAM, along with 128 gigabytes of storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

### Display Impact on Performance
The phone utilizes a 1080p Optic AMOLED display measuring 6.3 inches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This resolution (2280x1080) is highly beneficial for performance because the GPU isn't required to process as many pixels, resulting in an "everywhere is super smooth" experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. While not as sharp as Quad HD displays found in phones like the [[Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro screen performance and issues | Galaxy S9]] or [[Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro screen performance and issues | Pixel 2 XL]], the [[OnePlus 6 design and build quality | OnePlus 6]] offers what is considered the best-looking 1080p OLED display currently available in a phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### Oxygen OS and Software Experience
Oxygen OS, the phone's operating system, is lauded for being fast and smooth, while maintaining a close resemblance to stock Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. It includes useful features such as:
*   Super fast facial recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   A gaming mode that prevents notifications from interrupting gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   A new ambient display mode that activates when the phone is raised, though it is not "always-on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

The phone allows for a clean setup and is noted for being one of the first non-[[Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro screen performance and issues | Pixel]] phones to be included in the Android P beta program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. While this doesn't guarantee the same update timing as a Pixel, it suggests faster updates compared to devices from Samsung or LG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

One minor drawback noted in the software is the new gesture navigation. While functional and intuitive, the gestures are not as smooth or responsive as those found on the [[iPhone 11 Pro battery and performance | iPhone]], leading the reviewer to prefer traditional navigation buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

## Battery Life and Charging
The [[battery_life_and_charging_on_pixel_6_and_6_pro | OnePlus 6 battery]] situation is described as "really interesting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### Battery Performance
The phone is equipped with a 3,300 mAh battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This, combined with near-stock Android (Oxygen OS), the 1080p AMOLED display, and the powerful Snapdragon 845 processor with 8GB of RAM, contributes to exceptional battery longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Users can expect more than six hours of screen-on time daily, with the phone often ending the day with 40% charge if not heavily used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

### Charging Technology
The [[battery_life_and_charging_on_pixel_6_and_6_pro | OnePlus 6]] maintains Dash Charging, which is cited as the fastest zero-to-100 charging solution seen in a phone, offering significant convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### Wireless Charging
Despite having a glass back, the [[OnePlus 6 design and build quality | OnePlus 6]] does not feature wireless charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. However, due to the impressive standard battery life and the speed of Dash Charging, the absence of wireless charging is not considered a significant drawback or "deal-breaker" for the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

> [!tip] Summary
> The combination of decent battery size, efficient software, and lower-resolution display contributes to "A+ battery life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. The inclusion of rapid Dash Charging further alleviates the need for wireless charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

Apple has introduced a new ear scan feature for personalized spatial audio with the AirPods Pro 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>.

## How it Works

The feature utilizes Face ID depth sensors to measure the user's head and the depth of their ears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. This data is then used to create a personalized spatial audio mix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>. Other manufacturers, like Sony, have offered similar features using front-facing cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>.

## Perceived Effects

While the speaker initially questioned the usefulness, as spatial audio was already considered good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>, performing the personalized audio scan resulted in a noticeable change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. The soundstage seemed to widen, and there was a greater spread of different sounds and instrumentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>.

## Underlying Technology

This feature relies on extensive computational audio processing, made possible by the [[audio_quality_and_h2_chip_advancements | H2 chip]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.

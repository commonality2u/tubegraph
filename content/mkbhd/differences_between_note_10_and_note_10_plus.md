## Shared Characteristics
Both the [[Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10 Plus design and build|Note 10]] and [[Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10 Plus design and build|Note 10 Plus]] share several design and feature updates:
*   **Design**: They feature a boxy look with the display extending close to the edges, minimal top and bottom bezels, and a curved screen on both sides for an immersive, "almost entirely screen" feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Selfie Camera**: The selfie camera is positioned in the middle of the top of the phone within the "Infinity O" hole punch cutout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Fingerprint Reader**: The fingerprint reader is located underneath the display glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **No Headphone Jack**: Neither model includes a headphone jack, marking the first Samsung flagship without one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Samsung states this is due to space for a bigger battery, though the speaker suggests it's a deliberate choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. USB-C earbuds are included, but no dongle is provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

Holding it activates Bixby, and turning off the phone requires accessing a new button in the notification drop-down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **[[SPen features in Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10 Plus|S-Pen Features]]**: The S-Pen has been refreshed with new features such as converting handwriting to text in the background and indexing it for search within the Notes app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. New "air actions" allow controlling the camera by swiping between modes or flipping cameras, though zoom gestures were difficult to perform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Video Capabilities**: Both phones allow recording video with the ultra-wide camera and include features like live focus during video, improved Super Steady Shot stabilization, and a "zoom-in mic" feature that focuses the microphone array as you zoom in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **One UI**: The devices run on One UI, which offers improvements for one-handed use on larger screens and includes a native screen recorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Premium Build**: Both the [[Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10 Plus design and build|Note 10]] and [[Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10 Plus design and build|Note 10 Plus]] are described as being "built awesome," with premium metal and glass construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

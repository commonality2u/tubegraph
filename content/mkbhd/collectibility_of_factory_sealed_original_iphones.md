## The Appeal of Original Tech
In the world of classic collectibles, old pieces of technology are generally not highly sought after, with few people wanting to buy an iPhone 6 today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. However, the most coveted item in tech collecting is the factory-sealed, unopened original iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Rarity and Authentication Challenges
Finding a working, used original iPhone can be difficult due to their age, as evidenced by beat-up but still functional 2007 models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. However, discovering an original iPhone that is still sealed, never opened, and untouched by human hands is exceptionally rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

This extreme rarity and high value have led to scams where people re-seal used original iPhones and sell them as new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Many YouTubers have fallen victim to these scams, spending thousands of dollars on what they believed to be untouched devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The value difference between a used original iPhone and a new, sealed one is significant, making the effort to re-seal old phones worthwhile for scammers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This highlights the [[challenges_in_verifying_unopened_original_iphones | Challenges in verifying unopened original iPhones]].

Only about 6 million first-generation iPhones were sold, and the number of unopened units continues to decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Market Value and Auction History
The value of unopened original iPhones appears to have peaked.
-   In February, an original iPhone sold at auction for over $60,000, setting a record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
-   A month later, in March, another sold for $55,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
-   An even rarer model, featuring an "upside down lucky you" sticker, went for only $40,000 at a Chicago auction a few weeks later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The speaker of the video purchased this particular iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

The auction process for these devices involves live streaming with an auctioneer, similar to a traditional auction, rather than an online bidding site like eBay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. The speaker's winning bid was $32,000, with sales tax, bidding premium, and shipping increasing the total to $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Verifying an Unopened iPhone
Verifying a truly untouched iPhone requires significant trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. While X-rays from auction houses can confirm the presence of accessories inside the box, they don't confirm if the items are untouched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Checking the serial number on Apple's checker confirms if a phone was registered or activated, but not if it was opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

The speaker's purchased iPhone had minor cosmetic imperfections on its packaging, such as browning and a break in the corner, which might explain why it sold for less than the record price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. It also featured an upside-down "lucky you" sticker, which is rare and whose meaning is unknown even to Apple employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### Unboxing an Original iPhone
Unboxing a factory-sealed original iPhone immediately causes its monetary value to drop dramatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Upon opening the 16-year-old plastic wrap, a distinct smell is noticeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

The original iPhone packaging revealed the phone facing upwards with foam in the top of the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. The screen protector was a hard plastic piece, difficult to remove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

Inside the box, the following [[contents_of_the_iphone_7_retail_box | contents]] were found:
-   Documents designed by Apple in California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
-   A black microfiber cloth with "iPhone" on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
-   "Fingertips" booklet with tips for using the iPhone in 2007, such as setting a passcode, sending messages, and browsing the web <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
-   Apple stickers, which were noticeably askew, with one upside down and tilted, and the other right side up and tilted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This is a subtle [[differences_between_original_and_current_iphones | difference between original and current iPhones]].
-   A USB-A wall brick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
-   A 30-pin dock with a headphone jack out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
-   A 30-pin USB-A charging and data cable for connecting to iTunes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
-   EarPods, reminiscent of the iconic iPod commercials with white headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

### Initial Observations and Verification
The iPhone itself appeared brand new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. It was expected that a 16-year-old battery would not allow the phone to power on immediately, and indeed, it did not boot up, which was considered a good sign of its original state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. The pristine condition of the metal on the new iPhone was a stark contrast to a well-used model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

After further research and testing, including the difficulty of getting a 1.0 iPhone past the iTunes boot screen without a specific old iTunes version, the speaker was convinced the iPhone was legitimately brand new and unopened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

### Post-Unboxing Discoveries
After charging overnight, the original brick and cable did not power on the iPhone. However, replacing the brick (while keeping the original cable) allowed the phone to start charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

Notable features and discoveries:
-   The original iPhone did not include a SIM card ejector tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
-   It shipped with a gigantic original-sized SIM card, as the iPhone was an AT&T/Singular exclusive at launch, predating micro and nano SIM cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
-   The original iPhone did not have an App Store, only pre-installed apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
-   It was not possible to set a custom wallpaper with the first version of iOS, so all iPhones looked identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

Despite its current dramatically reduced value after being unsealed, the unboxing provided unique insights into the original iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. The mystery of the "lucky you" sticker remains unsolved, with speculation that it might be a holiday season sticker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

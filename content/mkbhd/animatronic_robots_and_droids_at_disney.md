The Walt Disney Company's [[disney_imagineering_labs_visit | Disney Imagineering Labs]] are responsible for designing and engineering the attractions, theme parks, and rides, which incorporate a significant amount of technology, including experimental and unreleased innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Realistic Animatronic Robots and Droids

[[disney_imagineering_labs_visit | Disney Imagineering]] creates realistic animatronic robots as part of their attractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Visitors to the labs have been greeted by little droids, similar to those found roaming the theme parks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Features and Functionality
These droids share striking similarities with the Boston Dynamics Spot robot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
They possess several key capabilities:
*   **Terrain Adaptation** Capable of adapting to any terrain and walking around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Control** They follow instructions from a customized Steam Deck controller, which is surprisingly easy to learn (taking about 60 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Endurance** They can navigate relentlessly throughout the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Interaction** Designed to interact with guests at a theme park and be fun to engage with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Advanced Animations** The droids blend various animations for actions like walking, standing, and looking around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### BB-8
Lanny Smoot, an inventor at Disney with over 70 patents, is credited with the technology that allows the BB-8 droid to roll around the park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. A multiplayer racing game involving controlling a BB-8 around a course by jogging has been demonstrated on the experimental HoloTile platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

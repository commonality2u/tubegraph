The iPhone 6s introduces significant [[camera_enhancements_and_features | camera enhancements]], including a new sensor and the capability for 4K video recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

## Main Camera Sensor and Optics
The iPhone 6s features a new 12-megapixel sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. While the flash and most optics remain the same as previous models, the new sensor brings noticeable improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### Image Quality
The most significant [[camera_improvements_and_capabilities | improvements]] in image quality are seen in colors and image processing, rather than a massive difference in detail when jumping from 8 megapixels to 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Detail and Sharpening**: There's plenty of detail throughout the frames without excessive sharpening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **Colors**: Colors tend to be consistently warm and are a natural, accurate representation of the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Exposure & Dynamic Range**: The camera handles exposure well, and dynamic range is good, as auto HDR is not overly aggressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Low Light**: In low light conditions, some noise is present, as expected, but it's not excessive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Ease of Use**: The camera interface is considered one of the best for balancing control and ease of use, making it fast, responsive, and simple to take great photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### Optical Image Stabilization (OIS)
The iPhone 6s Plus benefits from optical image stabilization (OIS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. This feature helps produce cleaner low-light photos and smoother video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. For serious video shooters, opting for the 6s Plus is recommended to utilize OIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

## 4K Video Recording
The upgrade from 8 to 12 megapixels allows the iPhone 6s to finally shoot 4K video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   The video produced by the sensor is described as beautiful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   Video characteristics mirror still photos: detail without being overly sharp, excellent exposure and dynamic range, and accurate, warm colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

## Live Photos
A new [[camera_features_and_performance | camera feature]] introduced this year is Live Photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Functionality**: Enabled by default, Live Photos capture 1.5 seconds of video and audio before and after the shutter button is pressed for every picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. A "live indicator" is visible during capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Viewing**: Users can view the short clip with sound by 3D touching the photo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Use Cases**: It can be interesting for capturing motion, like wind, or the lead-up/aftermath of a shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Limitations**:
    *   Live Photos cannot be shared; only the normal picture is shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
    *   They can only be set as wallpaper or Apple Watch faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
    *   They take up the space of two photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Perception**: Initially, Live Photos were considered somewhat of a gimmick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, seen largely as a demonstration for 3D Touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. An upcoming update is expected to use accelerometer and gyroscope data to prevent recording unnecessary motion like putting the phone away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

## Storage Considerations
The combination of 4K video and Live Photos means that 16GB of storage on the iPhone 6s is largely insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

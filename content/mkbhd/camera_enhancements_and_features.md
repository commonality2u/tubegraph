The [[iPhone camera capabilities and features | iPhone 13]] series introduces several enhancements and features to its camera system, impacting both hardware and software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## General [[camera_performance_and_features | Camera Performance]]
The overall impression of the [[iPhone camera capabilities and features | iPhone 13]]'s cameras is that they are a great set, performing well in broad daylight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Significant improvements are observed in challenging scenarios such as low light and with fast-moving subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Hardware Improvements
All camera sensors in the [[iPhone camera capabilities and features | iPhone 13]] lineup are larger and better, although they retain a 12-megapixel resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

*   **Ultra Wide Camera**: The ultra-wide lens shows notable improvements in sharpness across the entire frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Telephoto Lens (Pro models)**: The telephoto lens on the Pro models is now 3x, an upgrade from the 2.5x on the previous Pro Max, and also features a larger sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Physical Design**: The cameras are physically larger on the back of the phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. On the [[iPhone camera capabilities and features | iPhone 13]] and 13 mini, the cameras are now arranged diagonally, not just for aesthetic reasons but to accommodate the new, larger hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This results in an overall thicker camera bump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## New Camera Features

### ProRes Video (Pro models)
ProRes video, a high-quality codec often used in professional video production, was announced for the [[iPhone 14 Pro camera enhancements | iPhone 13 Pro]] and 13 Pro Max <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. However, this feature was not available at launch and is expected to be pushed out via a future software update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Macro Capability (Pro models)
The [[iPhone 14 Pro camera enhancements | iPhone 13 Pro]] models introduce a new macro capability utilizing their ultrawide lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Automatic Switching**: When an object is within approximately 14 cm, the camera automatically switches to the ultrawide lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Close Focus**: This allows for super close-up shots, maintaining focus even at 2 cm from the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Quality**: It leverages a high-quality sensor by taking a crop, which is preferable to a low-resolution dedicated macro camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **User Control Quirk**: The automatic switching to macro mode currently lacks a manual override option, meaning users cannot force the camera to stay on the primary sensor for close-up shots, which might result in different bokeh characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### Cinematic Mode (All models)
Cinematic Mode is a new software feature available across all [[iPhone camera capabilities and features | iPhone 13]] models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. It is processor-intensive, so it is exclusive to the [[iPhone camera capabilities and features | iPhone 13]] series and later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Functionality**: Described as "focus racking" and "AI-based face tracking," it aims to create more cinematic videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **User Experience**: For most users, it will appear as a "video portrait mode," applying a fake depth of field (background blur) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Interface**: It has its own dedicated swipe-over panel in the camera app, alongside portrait photos, regular photos, and regular videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Manual Controls**: The mode offers numerous manual controls for adjusting the effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

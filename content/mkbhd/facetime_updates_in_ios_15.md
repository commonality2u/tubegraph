## Key Improvements

*   **Spatial Audio** Spatial Audio has been introduced to FaceTime, allowing voices in group calls to sound as if they are coming from the direction of the speaker's orientation on the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.
*   **New Grid View** A new grid view option provides a neat layout to see all participants in a FaceTime call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.
*   **Portrait Mode** Users can now apply Portrait Mode to their video, blurring the background to keep the focus on the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.
*   **Microphone Modes** Different microphone modes are available to control audio input:
    *   **Standard** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>
    *   **Voice Isolation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>: Focuses on the user's voice by canceling out background noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
    *   **Wide Spectrum** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>: Captures all environmental sounds, useful for maintaining atmosphere like a coffee shop vibe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

## Major New Features

### SharePlay
SharePlay is a significant new feature that allows users to share experiences during a FaceTime call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
*   **Shared Media Consumption**: Users can listen to Apple Music or watch TV shows and movies on Apple TV together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.
*   **Synced Playback Controls**: Playback controls are synced, meaning if one person pauses, fast-forwards, or scrubs through content, it applies to everyone in the call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. This feature aims to make shared viewing seamless, eliminating the need for manual synchronization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.
*   **API for Developers**: SharePlay includes a new API, allowing other apps to integrate this functionality. Currently, Disney, HBO, and ESPN apps are supported, with hopes for future integration with services like Spotify, Netflix, and YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.

### FaceTime Events and Links
FaceTime calls can now be treated as events, offering greater flexibility and accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.
*   **Calendar Integration**: Calls can be added to calendars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.
*   **Shareable Links**: Users can share a link to a FaceTime call. This allows individuals on Windows desktops and Android phones to click the link and join the call, effectively extending FaceTime's reach beyond Apple devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

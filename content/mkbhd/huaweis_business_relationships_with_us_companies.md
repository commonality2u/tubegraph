From: [[mkbhd]] <br/> 

Huawei, a massive China-based technology company, engages in various tech businesses, including networking equipment, computers, and most notably, smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. As the world's second-largest smartphone vendor by market share, trailing only Samsung and ahead of [[Apple]], Huawei has a significant global presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The company was also the fastest-growing smartphone manufacturer globally, rapidly approaching the number one spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Escalating Trade Tensions and Security Concerns

Over several months, the US and China have been involved in an escalating trade war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Additionally, there has been a history of security concerns regarding the potential for US companies buying Huawei networking equipment to be spied on by the Chinese government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Due to these concerns, US government agencies were already banned from purchasing Huawei phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei's]] status in the US had been uncertain for some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## The US Government's Executive Order

The situation escalated when the US government signed an executive order, effectively adding [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]] to a blacklist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This order restricts [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]] from conducting any business with any US company, a move that has significantly impacted the tech world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### Impact on Google and Android

The most prominent consequence of the ban has been the severance of business ties with Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. As Google is a US company, it complied with the executive order by ceasing all business with [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]] and revoking its license to use Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This was not a choice made by Google but a compliance requirement, as US companies are prohibited from selling software or licenses to [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Effects on Existing Huawei Devices

For existing [[Future of Huawei Devices and Consumer Perception | Huawei devices]], including models like the P30 Pro, a 90-day exemption was issued, allowing for continued software and security updates until August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This exemption also applies to Honor, a sub-brand owned by [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. While Google confirmed that services like Google Play and Play Protect would continue to function on existing [[Future of Huawei Devices and Consumer Perception | Huawei devices]] for now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, it is expected that these phones will eventually cease receiving software updates and the latest versions of Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. After the 90-day extension, the software version on these phones will likely be their final one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## Huawei's Reliance on US Companies for Components

[[Huaweis Alternative Strategies and Challenges | Huawei]] spent $70 billion on hardware components last year, with $11 billion going to US companies such as Qualcomm and Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. An article by Ars Technica detailed that many parts for [[Huaweis Alternative Strategies and Challenges | Huawei]] smartphones, including Gorilla Glass, flash storage, and radios, originate from US companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

While it's not ideal, [[Huaweis Alternative Strategies and Challenges | Huawei]] theoretically could switch all its suppliers from US companies to others to circumvent the ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. As one of the few OEMs that does not rely on Qualcomm for its silicon, making its own Kirin 980 chip, [[Huaweis Alternative Strategies and Challenges | Huawei]] could potentially continue producing physical phones with significant effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Bloomberg reported that [[Huaweis Alternative Strategies and Challenges | Huawei]] had stockpiled a three-month supply of preferred parts in anticipation of the ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

## The Software Challenge: Life Without Google

Even with alternative hardware suppliers, the software aspect remains a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. While Android itself is open-source (AOSP), bare-bones stock Android lacks crucial Google services like Gmail, YouTube, and the Google Play Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

Recognizing its dependence on Google services, [[Huaweis Alternative Strategies and Challenges | Huawei]] has been quietly preparing for such a scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. The company has reportedly been developing a backup OS that supports Android apps and building its own app store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. However, establishing an alternative OS and app store is an immense challenge, especially without access to popular US apps like Netflix, Pandora, Facebook, and Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The failure of Amazon's multi-billion dollar efforts to create a comparable app store highlights the difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

## Broader Implications for Business and Competition

The impact extends beyond Google. [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]] is also cut off from other US companies like Microsoft, Intel, and Nvidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. This means [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]] cannot continue making its competitive Windows laptops without doing business with these crucial suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

The ban is detrimental to the tech industry as it reduces competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei's]] presence has pushed other companies to innovate, benefiting consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. The situation also affects the nascent folding phone market, with the highly anticipated Huawei Mate X potentially unable to run Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

## Outlook and Future Challenges

Despite the massive setback, [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]] is a colossal company with billions of dollars, giving it a fighting chance at recovery if the ban remains in effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. However, the greater long-term damage might be to consumer perception and [[Future of Huawei Devices and Consumer Perception | Huawei's]] reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Convincing consumers to buy a premium [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]] phone without Google Play Store or Android will be a tough sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. A similar situation in 2018 saw ZTE cut off from US business relationships, from which it never fully recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

The situation is far from over, with the possibility of the executive order being reversed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. However, for now, [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]] remains in an uncertain limbo, facing significant challenges to its future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

The September 2021 Apple event included a significant refresh for the iPad Mini, marking the biggest redesign of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. It has been a while since the iPad Mini received a refresh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

## Design Updates

The new iPad Mini is essentially a "tiny iPad Air" in its new design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Key design features include:
*   A full metal jacket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.
*   Four new color options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.
*   Nice curves at the corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

## Display and Performance

The star of the show for the new iPad Mini is its new 8.3-inch display with thin bezels, designed to fit in the palm of your hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. Internally, it features an A15 Bionic chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a> and now supports 5G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

A notable change is the inclusion of USBC, meaning all Apple iPads now have USB-C, with the exception of the [[baseline_ipad_updates | Baseline iPad]] which still uses Lightning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

### Display Refresh Rate
Despite the significant updates, the iPad Mini retains a 60Hz display, unlike the 120Hz display found on the iPad Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

## Camera System

The new iPad Mini includes significant camera upgrades:
*   A single camera at the back with a camera bump, a change from the previous iPad Mini which did not have one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.
*   A new 12-megapixel camera at the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.
*   A new Ultra-wide camera at the front featuring Center Stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

## Market Positioning

The updated iPad Mini now officially boasts a better and newer chip and internals compared to the iPad Air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>, suggesting the iPad Air needs a future update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. Overall, the iPad Mini was considered one of the biggest upgrades announced at the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>.

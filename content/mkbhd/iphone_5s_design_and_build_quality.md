The iPhone 5s, specifically the Space Gray model, is described as being as familiar as other iPhones, running iOS 7 with a similar array of icons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Size and Portability

The iPhone 5s is noted for its small size, particularly when compared to other contemporary flagship phones like the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 (5.7-inch display) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, the Samsung Galaxy S4 (5-inch display) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, and even the Moto X (4.7-inch display) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The iPhone 5s features a 4-inch display, making it the smallest among flagship devices at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Apple is recognized for being proud of its compact design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. The device is "really light, really easy to hold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, allowing users to reach all four corners of the display with one hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Build Quality and Materials

Despite its small stature, the iPhone 5s is described as being "extremely well built" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, crafted from premium materials, including metal, similar to the HTC One <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. It is "very tightly put together," with no creaking or twisting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. The hardware is "very well crafted," featuring solid aluminum on the sides and back, and precisely crafted buttons that do not wobble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. The buttons have laser etchings for volume indication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. The chamfered edges are angled slightly inwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, and the headphone jack and Lightning port are located on the bottom, accompanied by precisely milled speaker grille holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

While the device is robust, its "lack of any curves plus the glass on the back" (like the Nexus 4) makes it feel "delicate and vulnerable to scratches," prompting the reviewer to suggest using a case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Despite this perceived fragility, the phone is in fact "really sturdy" with "no creaking or bending at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

### Speaker Design

The iPhone 5s has two speaker grilles on the bottom, giving the appearance of stereo speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. However, it only features a single driver on the right-hand side, with the left side merely echoing the sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Covering the left grille results in no change to the sound, but covering the right grille (where the driver is) completely mutes the speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

### Overall Impressions

The iPhone 5s is praised for its "excellent build quality and design and material choices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. It is described as a "beautifully crafted device" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. However, the reviewer expresses a wish for a larger display despite loving its quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>, and notes that the device, while sturdy, feels a bit too small and fragile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

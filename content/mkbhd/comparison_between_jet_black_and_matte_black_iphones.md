## Design and Appearance

### Jet Black Finish
The Jet Black [[comparison_of_iphone_14_pro_with_previous_models|iPhone 7]] is characterized by its "super glossy" finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. It is highly prone to showing fingerprints, with its initial "fingerprint free" state being temporary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The finish also tends to show scratches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

### Matte Black Finish
The Matte Black [[comparison_of_iphone_14_pro_with_previous_models|iPhone 7 Plus]] has a "super clean" look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. While it will still show fingerprints, it does so to a lesser extent than the glossy Jet Black version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### Size and Camera Differences
The larger [[comparison_of_iphone_14_pro_with_previous_models|iPhone 7 Plus]] features dual cameras on its back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Both [[comparison_of_iphone_14_pro_with_previous_models|iPhone 7]] models still retain a significant bezel ("big ole forehead big old chin") compared to other larger phones like the Galaxy S7 Edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Hardware and Performance

### RAM
The [[comparison_of_iphone_14_pro_with_previous_models|iPhone 7 Plus]] is confirmed to have 3 gigabytes of RAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, whereas the [[comparison_of_iphone_14_pro_with_previous_models|iPhone 7]] has 2 gigabytes of RAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Home Button
Both phones feature a new capacitive home button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This home button does not physically move when the phone is off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. It is a piece of glass that is pressure-sensitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Users can choose the level of haptic feedback from the taptic engine when pressing the button, with three options ranging from a light to a very firm click response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

### A10 Fusion Chip and Benchmarks
The [[comparison_of_iphone_14_pro_with_previous_models|iPhone 7]] models are powered by the new A10 Fusion chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Geekbench 4 scores show strong performance, especially in multi-core tests, placing it above Snapdragon 820 devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Software Experience
Both iPhones run iOS 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. While many features are consistent with other devices running iOS 10, the new chip provides a faster and smoother experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Conclusion
If choosing between the Jet Black and Matte Black finishes, the Matte Black is suggested as the "safe route" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. The Jet Black is considered "almost like a special edition phone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a> but its tendency to show fingerprints and scratches is a significant consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

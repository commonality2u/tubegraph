The [[iOS 18 Passwords App]] is a new application introduced with [[iOS 18]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. It is one of the new apps that are automatically installed on iPhones with the update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## Functionality

The Passwords app essentially takes all the password management tools that were previously "buried in the settings" on the iPhone and makes them accessible as a standalone application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

Key features include:
*   **Centralized Access** The app provides a "super simple way of finding it all in one place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Search Capability** Users can easily search through their saved passwords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Two-Factor Authentication & Passkeys** The app supports both two-factor authentication and passkeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Shared Passwords** Users can create "shared passwords and pass keys within a group of trusted contacts," which works with other iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Secure Password Generation** When signing up for new accounts, the app offers to generate a "super secure password" and remember it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Security and Access

The app does not appear to have a master password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Instead, it defaults to using Face ID for login on the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## Cross-Platform Availability

While the Passwords app is a significant addition to the Apple ecosystem, it currently has limitations:
*   **No Android App** An Android version of the Passwords app has not been released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Other Platforms** The app is available on Mac and as a Chrome extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

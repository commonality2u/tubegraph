Huawei, a massive technology company based in China, operates across various sectors including networking equipment, computers, and notably, smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Huawei is currently the second-largest smartphone vendor globally by market share, trailing only Samsung and ahead of Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Background of Restrictions
The relationship between the U.S. and China has seen escalating trade tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Historically, there have been concerns regarding potential security risks, specifically the possibility of U.S. companies being spied on by the Chinese government if they purchased Huawei networking equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. As a result, U.S. government agencies were prohibited from buying Huawei phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This has kept Huawei's status in the U.S. market precarious for some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## The U.S. Blacklist
Recently, the U.S. government issued an executive order that effectively added Huawei to a blacklist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This order restricts Huawei from conducting any business with any U.S. company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The implications of this decision have been far-reaching, significantly impacting the tech world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### [[impact_of_huawei_ban_on_google_and_android | Impact of Huawei Ban on Google and Android]]
The most significant immediate consequence was Google, a U.S. company, complying with the executive order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This led to Google halting all business with Huawei and revoking Huawei's license to use Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This was not a choice made by Google but a compliance measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This decision is particularly detrimental for Huawei, which was the fastest-growing smartphone manufacturer globally, rapidly approaching the number one spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### [[future_of_huawei_devices_and_consumer_perception | Impact on Existing Huawei Devices]]
For current Huawei phone owners:
*   **90-Day Exemption**: Huawei received a 90-day exemption, allowing them to continue sending software and security updates to existing phones until August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This exemption also applies to Honor, a Huawei sub-brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Google Services**: Google confirmed via its Android account that services like Google Play and Google Play Protect will continue to function on existing Huawei devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Future Updates**: However, after the 90-day period, these phones will likely cease receiving software updates and the latest versions of [[impact_of_huawei_ban_on_google_and_android | Android]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Whatever software version they have at the end of the extension will likely be their final version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Hardware Supply
Huawei spent $70 billion on hardware components last year, with $11 billion going to U.S. companies like Qualcomm and Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Many components in Huawei smartphones, including Gorilla Glass, flash storage, and certain radios, originate from U.S. suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. While not ideal, it appears possible for Huawei to switch to non-U.S. suppliers for these parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Unlike many OEMs, Huawei produces its own Kirin 980 chip, reducing reliance on Qualcomm for silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Huawei had also reportedly built a three-month stockpile of preferred parts ahead of the ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### Software Challenges
The biggest hurdle for Huawei's future phones remains software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Without Google's license, they cannot use the full Android operating system or the Google Play Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Android Open Source Project (AOSP)**: Technically, basic, open-source Android (AOSP) can be used without a Google license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. However, this version lacks crucial Google services like Gmail and YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Internal Development**: Huawei has reportedly been preparing for such a scenario, quietly developing a backup operating system that supports Android apps and building its own app store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **App Store Viability**: Creating a successful alternative app store is an immense challenge. It's difficult to attract users to a new OS and app store, especially if it doesn't match the familiar experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Without business ties to U.S. companies, securing popular apps like Netflix, Pandora, Facebook, and Instagram for an alternative app store would be nearly impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Even large companies like Amazon have struggled to create viable app store alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Broader [[huaweis_business_relationships_with_us_companies | Business Relationships]]
Beyond Google, Huawei is cut off from other critical U.S. partners like Microsoft, Intel, and Nvidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. This impacts Huawei's ability to produce laptops, which have been competitive in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Without these U.S. companies, Huawei cannot continue making Windows laptops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## [[impact_on_the_smartphone_market | Impact on the Smartphone Market]] and Huawei's Future

The loss of Huawei from the market means less competition, which could reduce the incentive for other companies to innovate and improve their products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Huawei's presence has pushed other phone manufacturers to create better devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. The situation is also particularly bad for the nascent folding phone market, as Huawei's Mate X, a highly anticipated device, might not be able to run Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

### [[future_of_huawei_devices_and_consumer_perception | Consumer Perception and Recovery]]
Huawei is a massive company, leading some to believe it might be capable of recovering from such a significant setback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. The ideal scenario for Huawei would be a reversal of the executive order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. However, even if they can navigate the technical challenges, the damage to their brand [[future_of_huawei_devices_and_consumer_perception | reputation]] could be lasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. It will be challenging to convince consumers to purchase a Huawei phone if it lacks the Google Play Store or Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

A similar situation occurred with ZTE in 2018, where they were cut off from U.S. business relationships and never fully recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. However, Huawei's larger scale might lead to a different outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

## Current Status
The situation is fluid and could change, potentially being reversed in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. As of now, Huawei's future remains in an "unsatisfying limbo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

The iPhone X was highly anticipated, with the reviewer suggesting users "skip iPhone 8" for it, as it represents the future of Apple's smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Unboxing Experience
The unboxing experience for the iPhone X is "pretty much exactly the same as iPhone 8" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Both include headphones, adapters, and stickers in the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Physical Design and [[display_and_design_of_the_iphone_x | Display]]
One of the most significant differences between the iPhone X and iPhone 8 is its [[display_and_design_of_the_iphone_x | display]] and physical design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>:
*   **Aesthetic** The iPhone X is described as a "shiny chromy reflective phone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The silver variant has very shiny sides, while the space gray version is "a bit more toned down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Screen** The iPhone X features a 5.8-inch OLED "corner to corner" screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This larger screen fits into a footprint smaller than the iPhone 8 Plus, despite the 8 Plus having a smaller screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The display itself is noted for being bright, contrasty, well-calibrated, and not oversaturated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Notch** A prominent feature of the iPhone X's [[display_and_design_of_the_iphone_x | display]] is the notch at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Home Button** Unlike the iPhone 8, the iPhone X does not have a home button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## New Interaction Methods ([[ios_on_iphone_x_and_its_functionality | Software and Gestures]])
With the absence of a home button, the iPhone X introduces several new [[ios_on_iphone_x_and_its_functionality | gestures]] and button combinations:
*   **Go Home** A swipe up gesture is used to return to the home screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Screenshot** To take a screenshot, users now press the power and volume up buttons simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Power Off** Turning the phone off requires long-pressing both the power button and the volume up key to access the power off menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Siri** Holding the power button now activates Siri <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Apple Pay** Double-pressing the power button activates Apple Pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Multitasking/App Switching** There are also new [[ios_on_iphone_x_and_its_functionality | gestures]] for multitasking and app switching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Advanced Front-Facing Camera System ([[new_features_of_iphone_x_including_face_id | Face ID]] and Animoji)
A significant difference from the iPhone 8 is the new front-facing camera suite located in the notch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, which includes an IR blaster and depth sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This technology enables [[new_features_of_iphone_x_including_face_id | new features of iPhone X, including Face ID]]:
*   **[[new_features_of_iphone_x_including_face_id | Face ID]]** The iPhone X replaces the fingerprint-based Touch ID with [[new_features_of_iphone_x_including_face_id | Face ID]] for unlocking the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
    *   Setup is quick and painless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
    *   It works as advertised and is designed to be smart and not easily spoofed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
    *   Unlocking requires the user to look at the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
    *   It does not work with a picture, when the user is looking away, or when eyes are closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Animoji** The new front-facing camera suite also enables Animoji <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, allowing users to map their face to cartoon animal heads and send them in iMessage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

## Initial Camera Impressions (Selfie Portrait Mode)
The iPhone X's new front-facing camera also includes a selfie portrait mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Initial impressions suggest it is "pretty average," and "the iPhone just didn't want to blur the background at all" in some instances, being picky about lighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. The Pixel 2 was noted as being more "confident" with its front-facing camera portraits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, with a "pretty big difference between the two" particularly regarding edges and hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

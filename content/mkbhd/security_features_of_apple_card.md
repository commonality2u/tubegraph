The [[apple_card_unboxing_and_design_features | Apple Card]], announced at a services event in March, is a titanium credit card designed as an extension of [[apple_card_integration_with_iphone_and_wallet_app | Apple Pay]] in physical form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. It integrates deeply with the [[apple_card_integration_with_iphone_and_wallet_app | Wallet app]] on iPhone, offering several security features.

## Integration with iPhone for Enhanced Security
The [[apple_card_unboxing_and_design_features | Apple Card]] is secured through the iPhone, making it difficult for unauthorized users to access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

*   **[[new_features_of_iphone_x_including_face_id | Face ID]] Protection**
    Every transaction and access to the card's details within the [[apple_card_integration_with_iphone_and_wallet_app | Wallet app]] is secured with [[new_features_of_iphone_x_including_face_id | Face ID]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This means that even if someone finds or steals the physical card, they cannot use it without your iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, or if they have your iPhone, they cannot use it without your face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Remote Deactivation**
    Users can remotely deactivate their card directly from the [[apple_card_integration_with_iphone_and_wallet_app | Wallet app]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Virtual Card Numbers for Online Purchases**
    The [[apple_card_integration_with_iphone_and_wallet_app | Wallet app]] allows users to retrieve the card number for online purchases, which can be entered into online forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## Physical Card Design
The physical [[apple_card_unboxing_and_design_features | Apple Card]] has a clean design that also contributes to its security.

*   **No Card Number, CVV, or Signature**
    The physical titanium card itself does not display a card number, expiration date, or CVV, enhancing its security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Signatures are also not required anymore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This minimalist design helps protect sensitive information if the card is lost or stolen.

## User Interface for Monitoring
The [[apple_card_integration_with_iphone_and_wallet_app | Wallet app]] provides features that help users monitor their spending and identify suspicious activity.

*   **Transaction History with Map Locations**
    The app offers a detailed purchase history for every transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Users can view each transaction on a map, making it easy to identify the exact location of a purchase if they don't recognize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

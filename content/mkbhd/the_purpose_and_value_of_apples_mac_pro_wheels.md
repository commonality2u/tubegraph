The Apple Mac Pro offers optional wheels, a feature highlighted for its peculiar pricing and limited utility [00:00:40]. Initially, it's not clear why wheels would be needed for a computer that typically remains stationary at a desk [00:00:53]. While there's nothing inherently wrong with selling a niche product [00:01:03], these wheels sparked considerable discussion due to their cost.

## Pricing Structure

The Mac Pro wheels can be purchased in two ways:
*   As a $400 option when configuring a new Mac Pro [00:01:06].
*   Separately for $700 for self-installation after purchase [00:01:12].

This significant price point has been described as "ridiculous," "stupid," and "insulting" [00:01:30].

## Design and Quality

Despite the controversial pricing, the wheels themselves are objectively well-made. They are considered "really nice wheels," possibly the "nicest computer wheels" the reviewer has ever seen, standing in stark contrast to typical dusty, plastic casters found in schools [00:01:52].

Key features include:
*   **Material**: Entirely metal and rubber [00:02:08].
*   **Weight**: Each wheel is hefty, weighing more than twice an iPhone 11 Pro, indicating a solid metal construction [00:02:10].
*   **Tooling**: They come with a metal dual-sided hex tool featuring a black rubberized sleeve for grip [00:02:23]. The box also includes two nearly identical installation guides [00:02:32].
*   **Articulation**: The wheels fully articulate 360 degrees at every joint, with the top joint rotating completely [00:02:45].
*   **Treads**: They feature two fully independent, articulate, super smooth rubber treads [00:02:53]. This design allows for a tighter turning radius, similar to a car with torque vectoring [00:03:02].

Despite their high quality, the reviewer concludes that the wheels are not worth $700 [00:03:08], especially when considering that a device like an iPhone SE, with "tiny microchips and ram and a motherboard and batteries and cameras and software tying it all together and the screen," costs $400 [00:03:14]. The material cost alone does not justify the price [00:03:28].

## Lack of Practical Value

The practical value of the Mac Pro wheels is limited. They enable the Mac Pro to be moved, but without brakes, and the Mac Pro must be plugged into a wall to operate, diminishing the convenience of mobility [00:03:40]. The argument that the high cost covers the tooling required for low-volume sales is also dismissed, as Apple often subsidizes less successful products with more popular ones [00:04:08].

## Apple's Strategic Intent

The primary purpose of the Mac Pro wheels seems to be tied to Apple's broader brand strategy [00:04:27]:

### Maintaining a Luxury Brand Image
Apple cultivates an image as a premium, luxury brand, which allows them to charge more for their products [00:04:30]. Luxury brands often feature extremely expensive items that, while not necessarily high-volume sellers, reinforce their high-end status [00:04:37]. Apple is positioned as the luxury company within the competitive tech world [00:05:08].

This contrasts with Apple's ability to price competitively where it benefits their business, such as the $329 iPad or the $400 iPhone SE [00:05:30]. However, to maintain its premium image, Apple also needs high-priced products [00:05:49]. They sometimes choose to offer only expensive versions of products, like the Mac Pro desktop tower [00:06:06]. Price itself can influence perceived quality; studies suggest people often assume a higher-priced item is of better quality, even if identical to a cheaper alternative [00:06:36].

### Generating Media Attention
Controversial products like the Mac Pro wheels serve as "all press is good press" marketing [00:07:37]. Articles about the wheels often mention other [[apple_vision_pro_hardware_and_design | Apple products]], shine a light on the Mac Pro, and highlight Apple's history [00:07:39]. Some articles even list other Apple products that could be bought for the same price as the wheels [00:07:50].

This strategy allows Apple to generate significant attention for relatively low-stakes products. The Mac Pro wheels, along with other high-priced accessories like the $1,000 monitor stand, the $300 coffee table book, or the $17,000 gold Apple Watch, are "perfect place[s] to sacrifice" for media buzz because most consumers were not going to buy them anyway [00:08:00]. By talking about these extravagant prices, the public inadvertently gives Apple the attention it seeks [00:08:37].

Net metering is a system where excess electricity generated by a home's solar panels is sent back to the electrical grid, effectively spinning the household's electricity meter backward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. This system allows homeowners to achieve a $0 electricity bill by offsetting their usage with their solar generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

## How Net Metering Works

When solar panels generate more electricity than a home is currently using, the excess power is exported to the grid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. This process causes the electrical meter to spin backward, accumulating credits for the homeowner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. Conversely, when the sun goes down or the home's demand exceeds solar production, electricity is pulled from the grid, and the meter spins forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. The goal is to achieve a "net zero" total usage, resulting in no electricity charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

### Achieving a $0 Bill

The speaker, who drives an electric car and powers various appliances with solar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, confirms that they have not paid for electricity in a year thanks to their solar setup and net metering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Even during winter months when solar production is lower and consumption (especially for [[Battery life and charging capabilities | electric car charging]]) is higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>, accumulated credits from sunnier seasons often offset the deficit, maintaining a $0 monthly bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

#### Credit Rollover
Net metering credits roll over from month to month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. For example, if a homeowner produces more than they use in August, they accumulate a credit, which then reduces their bill in subsequent months even if they use more grid energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. However, these credits typically reset once per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

## Practical Experience

The speaker observed distinct seasonal patterns in solar generation and home usage:
*   **Summer**: Long days and abundant sun yield significant electricity generation, often exceeding 200 kWh per day on good days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. Despite high usage from air conditioning and electric car charging, net grid usage was typically zero to slightly negative (selling back to the grid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.
*   **Fall**: Shorter days but reduced need for air conditioning led to more excess electricity generation, with many days ending with a net negative grid usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   **Winter**: This season is particularly challenging due to shortest days, frequent cloud cover, and reduced [[Battery life and charging capabilities | electric car efficiency]] in cold weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. Daily generation could drop to 20-70 kWh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. As a result, November, December, and January saw positive net grid usage (pulling more from the grid than produced) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.
*   **Spring**: Things "flip super fast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>, with May being the month of highest excess solar generation due to consistently sunny days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

Despite these fluctuations, the speaker's total annual electricity bill was $0 due to the accumulated credits from high-production months offsetting the low-production months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

### The Small Catch
While the energy consumption portion of the bill was zeroed out, the power company still charged a fixed monthly fee of $57.50, effectively an account maintenance fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. This means the overall utility bill wasn't strictly zero, but the cost of electricity itself was eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

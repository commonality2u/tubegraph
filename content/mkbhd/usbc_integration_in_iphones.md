The iPhone 15 lineup, including the 15, 15 Plus, 15 Pro, and 15 Pro Max, introduces new ports as part of its updates for new phones in the lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This marks the [[introduction_of_usbc_in_iphones | introduction of USB-C in iPhones]] across the entire range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Unboxing and Cable Inclusion
All new iPhones in the 15 lineup now ship with a single, white, braided USB-C to USB-C cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This is noted as the first time the iPhone is shipping with a braided cable of this quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. It is expected to be of higher quality and more durable than previous cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Charging Capabilities
The [[significance_of_usbc_port_in_iphone_15_pro | USB-C port in the iPhone 15 Pro]] allows the phone to charge accessories directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. While there is no reverse wireless charging, a USB-C cable can be plugged in to charge items like AirPods or an Apple Watch MagSafe charger from the iPhone's battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

The rules for charging between devices via USB-C are as follows:
*   **USB-C iPhone to Older Lightning iPhone**: When an older Lightning iPhone is plugged into a USB-C iPhone, the USB-C iPhone will always supply battery to the Lightning iPhone, regardless of their charge states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **USB-C iPhone to USB-C iPhone**: If two USB-C iPhones are connected, they perform a handshake to determine which one has the lower battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. The iPhone with the higher charge will then act as a battery bank and charge the one with the lower charge until unplugged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **USB-C iPhone to Android Phones**: If an Android phone with USB Power Delivery (USB PD) is connected to a USB-C iPhone and has more battery, it will act as a battery bank for the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. However, if the Android phone lacks USB PD, the charging behavior can be inconsistent, with either device potentially charging the other, sometimes requiring unplugging and re-trying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

The power output for charging accessories or other smartphones is 4.5 watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, which is not designed for fast charging but is ideal for accessories and can be used to "rescue another smartphone in a pinch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. The [[usbc_cable_inclusion_and_charging_brick_absence | USB-C cable inclusion]] in the box allows for direct charging of new AirPods or other compatible devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

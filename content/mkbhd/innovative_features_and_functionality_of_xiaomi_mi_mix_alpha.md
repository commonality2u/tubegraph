The Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha is a functional smartphone prototype developed by Xiaomi, showcasing a unique design concept rather than being a retail product with a shipping date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This device is part of Xiaomi's Mix line, known for pushing design limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The primary innovation is its "surround display" concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, where the screen curves almost entirely around the device to the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## [[xiaomi_mi_mix_alpha_wraparound_display_concept | Wraparound Display]]

The most striking feature of the Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha is its unique [[xiaomi_mi_mix_alpha_wraparound_display_concept | wraparound display]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This design creates a seamless, immersive visual experience, making the phone appear futuristic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

*   **Display Specifications**: The phone features a 2088 x 2250 OLED display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. It boasts very thin top and bottom bezels that connect to a vertical camera strip on the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Aesthetic Appeal**: The visual effect of the display wrapping around the device is notable, garnering attention from any angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Animations**:
    *   **Charging Animation**: When plugged in, the entire screen lights up with an animation that simulates liquid power filling the battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. This animation is brief and doesn't stay on continuously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
    *   **Notifications**: Incoming notifications cause the screen to glow all the way around the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## Camera System

The Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha integrates its camera system into the wraparound display concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

*   **Primary Camera Setup**: The camera strip on the back houses a 108-megapixel primary camera, a 20-megapixel ultrawide camera with macro capabilities, and a 12-megapixel telephoto camera, alongside a dual LED flash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Selfie Functionality**: There is no dedicated selfie camera on the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Instead, users can flip the phone around and use the high-end main cameras for selfies, benefiting from their superior quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This also provides a legitimate camera viewfinder on the back display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

Despite being a prototype, the device features high-end [[technical_specifications_of_xiaomi_mi_mix_alpha | specifications]] and premium [[design_and_materials_of_xiaomi_mi_mix_alpha | materials]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

*   **Processor**: Snapdragon 855 Plus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Storage and RAM**: 512 GB of UFS 3.0 storage and 12 GB of RAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Battery**: A 4050 mAh battery with 40-watt fast charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **5G Connectivity**: The phone is 5G enabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **In-Display Fingerprint Reader**: It impressively includes an in-display fingerprint reader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **[[design_and_materials_of_xiaomi_mi_mix_alpha | Materials]]**: The frame is made of a titanium alloy, harder than stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Camera covers are sapphire, and the camera strip itself is ceramic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The phone is notably heavy and dense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Software Optimizations (MIUI Alpha)

Xiaomi's MIUI Alpha software includes specific optimizations for the unique display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

*   **Side-Mounted Status Bar**: Battery, status bar icons, and notification counters are displayed on the side of the phone, freeing up the top of the main screen for a cleaner notification pull-down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Back Panel Widgets**: Flipping the phone activates a panel on the back display with quick-access widgets like a timer and weather information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

## Handling and Interactions

The unique form factor of the Mi Mix Alpha introduces distinct handling characteristics and interaction methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

*   **Ergonomics**: The phone is heavy, but its display glass offers surprising grip compared to other glass phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. The immersion factor of holding an all-screen device is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Speaker and Earpiece**: A regular speaker is at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. The earpiece for phone calls is replaced by an electromagnetic speaker that vibrates through the glass to create sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   **Virtual Side Buttons**: The phone features virtual power and volume buttons on the right side of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
    *   **Volume Control**: Hitting the virtual volume button, while palm rejection is active, brings up a slider on the front screen for adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This functionality is inconsistent in the prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
    *   **Power Button**: A virtual power button puts the phone to sleep, working more consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
    *   **Physical Power Button**: A physical circular power button at the top of the phone also serves for sleep/wake, offering a reliable but less accessible option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Palm Rejection**: Xiaomi utilizes accelerometers, gyroscopes, pressure sensors, and software algorithms to distinguish between holding and using the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. While impressive when successful, accidental presses are frequent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_practical_considerations_of_xiaomi_mi_mix_alpha | Prototype Limitations and Challenges]]

As a prototype, the Mi Mix Alpha presents several [[challenges_and_practical_considerations_of_xiaomi_mi_mix_alpha | practical considerations]] and areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

*   **Display Construction**: The wraparound display is not a single curved piece of glass. Instead, there are three pieces that connect at the apex of the sides, creating a noticeable gap and an uneven feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This can also cause light to rainbow from certain angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Display Imperfections**: Slight yellowing at the very edges of the display can sometimes be noticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   **Stability**: The phone wobbles significantly when placed on a flat surface due to the camera strip being the only flat point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   **Case Design**: A minimal case exists, primarily anchoring to the camera strip, offering limited protection to the extensive display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   **Screen-to-Body Ratio Claims**: Xiaomi claims a 180.6% screen-to-body ratio, but this likely includes the wrapped sides and doesn't account for the 2.15mm bezels at the top and bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **Screen Size Measurement**: The stated 7.9-inch diagonal screen size is measured from corner-to-corner around the back, not just the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Its effective front display size is comparable to devices like the Pixel 4 or [[iPhone 11 Pro Max|iPhone 11 Pro Max]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

Overall, the Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha is a "form over function" concept smartphone, akin to concept cars, designed to explore future mobile device possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

The [[iphone_12_pro_display_and_screen_technology | iPhone 12]] introduces a new design and significant display upgrades that make it a favorite iPhone for some users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. While very similar to the Pro models in size, main cameras, battery, and charging, there are some differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Display Improvements

The most significant new feature of the [[iphone_12_pro_display_and_screen_technology | iPhone 12]] is its new display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. It marks a substantial upgrade from previous models:
*   **Resolution and Type** The display has transitioned from a 720p LCD with larger bezels to a much improved 6.1-inch 1080p OLED screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This change is described as "night and day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
*   **Parity with Pro** The display is virtually on par with the Pro models, with only a slightly lower peak brightness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **Refresh Rate** The screen operates at 60Hz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. While 120Hz displays were expected for the Pro models in 2020, none of the [[iphone_12_pro_display_and_screen_technology | iPhone 12]] models received it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This decision was likely a battery-saving measure, especially considering the integration of 5G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### Ceramic Shield
All new [[iphone_12_pro_display_and_screen_technology | iPhones]] feature "Ceramic Shield" on the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. This specialty hardened glass with a crystal structure is designed to offer four times better drop protection, enhancing shatter resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

*   **Shatter vs. Scratch Resistance** Typically, shatter resistance is inversely proportional to scratch resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. A softer material is less likely to shatter but easier to scratch, and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Real-world Durability** Despite the claims of better drop protection, it's noted that the [[iphone_12_pro_display_and_screen_technology | iPhone 12]] may not be significantly more scratch resistant than previous models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Battery Life

The [[iphone_12_pro_display_and_screen_technology | iPhone 12]]'s battery life has been generally good, but not noticeably better than the previous year's models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

*   **Efficiency** It's impressive that the phone maintains decent battery performance despite featuring a slightly larger, higher-resolution display and a physically smaller battery compared to its predecessor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   **Daily Usage** Under heavy use, including around six hours of screen-on time, the phone's battery can be depleted within a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Alternative for Battery Champions** For users seeking exceptional battery life, opting for a larger phone (like the Pro Max) is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## 5G and Battery Management

The integration of 5G connectivity in the [[iphone_12_pro_display_and_screen_technology | iPhone 12]] has implications for battery consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Power Consumption** 5G radios are known to be power-hungry, meaning more time spent on 5G results in greater battery drain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
*   **Smart Data Mode** To mitigate this, Apple introduced "Smart Data Mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. This feature intelligently switches between 5G and 4G (LTE) to conserve battery:
    *   In a 4G area, the phone remains on 4G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
    *   In a 5G area, if performing bandwidth-intensive tasks (e.g., downloading videos, FaceTime calls), the phone will utilize 5G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
    *   If in a 5G area but not engaged in high-bandwidth activities, the phone will revert to 4G speeds to save power, even if the 5G indicator is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Analogy to ProMotion** This adaptive technology is compared to ProMotion on the iPad Pro, which dynamically adjusts its refresh rate (e.g., up to 120Hz for scrolling, down to 24Hz for static content) to save battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
*   **User Experience** While 5G is a significant feature, it's advised not to purchase the [[iphone_12_pro_display_and_screen_technology | iPhone 12]] solely for its 5G capabilities at present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. However, it can be a beneficial bonus in current or future 5G-enabled areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

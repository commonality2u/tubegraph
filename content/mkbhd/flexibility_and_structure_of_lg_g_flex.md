The [[LG G Flex selfhealing technology | self-healing]] properties of the LG G Flex involve two main aspects: its backing material and its unique curved design, or "flex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The phone's ability to flex is a key component of its overall [[durability_of_lg_g_flex | durability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## The Flexing Capability
The LG G Flex can be completely flattened from its curved shape without sustaining any internal damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. This capability is described as impressive, especially compared to other curved phones like the Samsung Galaxy Round, which cannot match this level of resiliency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. The phone holds up to flexing as demonstrated in LG's official advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not attempt to flex other smartphones at home unless they are specifically designed with this capability, such as the LG G Flex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Internal Resilience
Despite its impressive flexibility, the internal components of the LG G Flex remain undamaged during the flexing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. The phone incorporates large internal components, including a 3500 milliamp-hour battery and a six-inch display, along with standard parts like a processor and RAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. The exact method by which these internal components remain unaffected by the flexing is not detailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

[[Display and screen updates | Adaptive refresh rate technology]], often referred to as ProMotion by Apple, allows a screen to dynamically adjust its refresh rate based on the content being displayed. This technology offers significant benefits in terms of user experience and battery efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

## How it Works
Unlike fixed refresh rate displays, an [[Display and screen updates | adaptive refresh rate]] display, specifically an LTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) display, can vary its refresh rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. The iPhone 13 Pro's ProMotion display, for example, can ramp up to 120 Hz for smooth motion and rapid interactions, but also reduce its refresh rate to as low as 10 Hz when static content is on screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. It cycles between 12 different refresh rates, which is seven more than the iPad Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

Examples of adaptive behavior:
*   **Movies:** For a 24 FPS movie, the display refreshes 24 times per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   **Scrolling/Gaming:** When scrolling through websites or social media, or [[Gaming performance in 8K resolution | gaming]], the refresh rate will be high (e.g., pinned at 120 Hz) for a smooth experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.
*   **Static Content:** If viewing a home screen or reading text where nothing is moving, the rate can drop to 10 Hz to save battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:53]</a>.

This technology has existed in other phones for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>, with different phones implementing ramping up and down at different times and for different reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. An example given is Android phones often defaulting to 60 Hz for Google Maps to save battery, despite the phone's higher refresh rate capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

## Benefits and User Experience
The primary benefits of [[Adaptive refresh rate technology | adaptive refresh rate]] are:
*   **Smoother Visuals:** Animations and interactions feel more fluid and responsive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.
*   **Improved [[Display and screen updates | Display and screen updates]] Quality:** Text can appear more crisp while scrolling, and touch responsiveness is enhanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.
*   **Battery Efficiency:** By lowering the refresh rate when not needed, the display consumes less power, contributing to extended battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

While the technical implementation of ProMotion is "pretty great" and results in a "very smooth" display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>, initial user perception varies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. Many people, especially those who have only ever used 60 Hz phones, may not immediately notice the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. However, once users become accustomed to a high refresh rate, switching back to a 60 Hz display becomes noticeable and undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.

## Implementation on iPhone 13 Pro
The [[iPhone 12 Pro display and screen technology | iPhone 13 Pro display and screen technology]] features Apple's ProMotion [[Display and screen updates | display and screen updates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. While iOS is smoother and more responsive with this technology, many third-party apps initially remained at 60 Hz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. Apple has provided developers with detailed instructions to easily update their apps to fully support ProMotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Limiting Frame Rate
> The iPhone 13 Pro allows users to limit the display refresh rate to 60 Hz, but this setting is found in Accessibility settings under "Motion" and "Limit Frame Rate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>. It is suggested that this setting might not significantly save battery given the display's ability to actively drop below 60 Hz when not needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:29:00">[15:29:00]</a>.

Despite some apps needing updates, the [[Display quality of Sony smartphones | display quality of Sony smartphones]] is considered "one of the best looking screens on any phone right now" due to its color accuracy, brightness, and smoothness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. The use of LTPO also contributes to the improved battery life of these phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.

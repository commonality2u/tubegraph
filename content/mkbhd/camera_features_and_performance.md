The [[camera_enhancements_and_features | camera]] in the Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus is highlighted as the "biggest most reimagined new change" in these phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Key Camera Features

*   **Main Camera**: The Galaxy S9 features a new 12-megapixel camera on the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   **S9 Plus Dual Camera**: The S9 Plus model includes a second telephoto camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, which is useful for live focus and optical zoom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
*   **Variable Aperture**: It is the first modern smartphone to feature a variable aperture [[camera_technology_in_sony_phones | camera]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This allows it to physically switch between f/1.5 and f/2.4 depending on lighting conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
    *   **f/2.4**: The default setting, used for sharp, normal daylight photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
    *   **f/1.5**: Engages in low light conditions (under 100 lux) to let in more light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. The mechanism for this is described as "really impressive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Video Recording**:
    *   Supports shooting video in Rec.2020 color space, which occurs when HDR is enabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. This aims for a more saturated and vibrant look on Samsung displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, but can be turned off to revert to Rec.709 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
    *   Offers Super Slow-mo at 960 frames per second at 720p <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, with an automatic detection feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **AR Emoji**: A new feature that creates an animated avatar based on your face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

## Camera Performance

*   **General Photo Quality**: Photos from the Galaxy S9 camera are generally considered "pretty damn good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Processing**: Photos are described as slightly less over-processed and over-sharpened compared to previous Samsung phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Color and Look**: They still maintain the characteristic "Samsung look" with bright, vibrant colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Range**: The most noticeable improvement in [[camera_capabilities_and_improvements_in_galaxy_s22 | image quality]] is in dynamic range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Exposure Tendency**: The camera has a tendency to slightly overexpose photos in auto mode, making them a "little bit too bright" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Low Light Performance**:
    *   Galaxy S9 low light photos look good, largely due to the f/1.5 aperture letting in more light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
    *   The variable aperture makes a tangible difference in low light, leading to a "real bump up" in quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
    *   There is less smoothing in low light images because the increased light reduces grain, meaning less post-processing is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   **Overall Ranking**: While significantly improved, the S9's [[camera_quality_and_features_of_iphone_5s | camera]] is not considered the best in any smartphone, with the Pixel 2 still holding that title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, and still slightly behind the iPhone X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. However, its "third place performance" is noted as excellent, and users are unlikely to be disappointed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## Galaxy S9 vs. S9 Plus Camera

The Galaxy S9 Plus has a "pretty big advantage" in the [[camera_improvements_and_capabilities | camera]] department over the regular S9 due to the inclusion of a second telephoto camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. This additional lens enables features like live focus and optical zoom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. While the regular S9's single [[camera_performance and features | camera]] is strong, those who value optical zoom might prefer the S9 Plus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

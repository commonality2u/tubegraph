The interior and [[user_interface_and_user_experience | user interface]] of the Tesla Cybertruck present a distinctive, minimalist design, reflecting the vehicle's overall angular aesthetic, though with some surprising conventional elements and advanced technological features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

## Interior Design and Features
The Cybertruck's interior largely consists of straight angles and triangles, with the only notable curve being the steering wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

### Driver's Cabin
*   **Steering Wheel**: Unlike earlier prototypes, the final version features a full circular wheel rather than a yoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. The buttons on the steering wheel are now haptic, offering an actual click and movement, improving upon previous Tesla designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>. These buttons control blinkers, headlights, the windshield wiper, and voice controls, along with media volume and autopilot settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>. The horn is a traditional push-down horn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. Notably, there is no Tesla logo on the steering wheel, instead featuring a Cybertruck trapezoid silhouette <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.
*   **Glass Canopy**: The Cybertruck boasts the single largest piece of glass in the automotive industry, extending from the nose of the car to just in front of the driver's head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. This provides a dramatic canopy effect and very good visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. Removable sunshades with magnetic connectors are also present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.
*   **Storage**: The doors offer good storage, capable of holding two water bottles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. There's also tray storage, a large open tray space in the center console (similar to the Rivian) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>, two wireless chargers, two cup holders, and a large armrest with additional storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.
*   **Charging Ports**: The center console storage includes a 120-volt outlet and a single 65-watt USB-C charging port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.
*   **Visibility**: While the large windshield offers good overall visibility, seeing over the short nose of the truck is challenging, requiring drivers to guess the front's position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.
*   **Lighting**: Touch-sensitive overhead lights and ambient lighting around the cabin can be customized with RGB colors via software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>.
*   **Cameras**: An interior-facing cabin camera is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. The traditional rear-view mirror does not turn into a camera feed; instead, the rear camera view is always displayed on the main screen, requiring a new muscle memory for checking behind the vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.
*   **Glove Box**: The glove box is a drawer, opened via a button on the touchscreen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.
*   **Gears**: While gears can still be changed on the screen, physical park, reverse, neutral, and drive selectors are uniquely located overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.

### Rear Interior
*   **Door Opening**: The rear doors open a full 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.
*   **Legroom**: Excellent rear legroom is achieved due to the front seats being mounted on rectangular risers, allowing feet to slide underneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.
*   **Seating and Storage**: The rear seats offer some seatback storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. For additional covered storage, both the right and left two seats can be completely lifted using a latch system, creating a large, flat storage area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.
*   **Rear Screen**: A 9.5-inch screen is available for rear passengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>. This screen allows control of the passenger seat, directs airflow, and serves as an entertainment display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>.
*   **Heated Seats**: The left and right rear seats are heated, though they do not offer ventilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.

## User Interface (Software)
The [[software_and_user_experience | software]] experience is centered around a new 18.5-inch touchscreen, the largest ever in a Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.
*   **Design and Theme**: The layout is familiar to Tesla users but is themed with Cybertruck aesthetics, referred to as "cyber UI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. The main vehicle control screen displays a large Cybertruck model, with hovering dots allowing real-time adjustments for tailgate, tonneau cover, and charge port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.
*   **Real-time Visuals**: Adjustments like ride height, windows, and even steering wheel movement are reflected in real-time on the digital model of the truck on the screen, set against a "Mars terrain" or "cyber terrain" backdrop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.
*   **Navigation**: The navigation system can fill the right two-thirds of the screen, keeping vehicle controls visible on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>.
*   **Control Layout**:
    *   **Controls**: This section manages general vehicle functions like opening/closing doors, screen brightness, headlights, and the electronic glove box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.
    *   **Dynamics**: This area allows customization of driving profiles. For the triple motor version, acceleration modes include "Comfort," "Standard," and "Beast Mode" (maximum acceleration) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>. Custom settings allow individual adjustment of ride and handling (damping and suspension firmness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.

## Steering System
The Cybertruck utilizes a steer-by-wire system, a first for Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>.
*   **Constant Ratio**: The steering ratio remains constant, meaning the steering weight or feel cannot be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>.
*   **Rear Axle Steering**: The truck features very active rear axle steering, capable of up to 10 degrees in the opposite direction of the front wheels at speeds under 40 mph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. This effectively shortens the wheelbase, enabling much tighter turns and enhancing maneuverability in parking lots, making the large truck feel smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>. At speeds above 40 mph, the rear wheels turn 1-2 degrees in the same direction as the front wheels, which lengthens the wheelbase for more stable high-speed lane changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>.
*   **Turn Radius**: The total steering turn from lock to lock is less than 180 degrees (approximately 170 degrees), meaning maximum tight turns are achieved in less than half a wheel turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>. This dramatically reduces the amount of wheel movement required, taking significant time to adapt to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>.

Despite initial adjustments, the [[Software and user experience | software]] and [[user_interface_and_user_experience | user experience]] in the Cybertruck are highly functional and well-integrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>. The quiet cabin, attributed to laminated, shatterproof windows, contributes to a refined driving experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.

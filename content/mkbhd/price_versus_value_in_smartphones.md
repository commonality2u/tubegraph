Reviewing smartphones often becomes an exercise in understanding the law of diminishing returns, a concept where the benefits gained become less than the investment made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. For instance, a $300 phone offers a certain value, spending an additional $300 yields significantly more value, another $300 adds a little more, and a final $300 increment delivers only a tiny bit extra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This principle is key to understanding the value proposition of devices like the OnePlus 6.

## The OnePlus 6: A Study in Value

The OnePlus 6 aims to reverse the trend of pushing value as high as possible by instead focusing on how much price can be cut without sacrificing significant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Starting at $529, the OnePlus 6 positions itself distinctively in a market dominated by $700, $800, $900, and $1000 flagships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. OnePlus annually strives for a balance between features to keep and features to cut, and in 2018, they produced a "balanced budget performance beast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Strengths and High-Value Features

The OnePlus 6 delivers a high-quality experience in several key areas, particularly for its [[comparison_to_other_phones_in_the_market | price]]:

*   **Build and Design**: The phone boasts a "legit awesome" build, with a solid feel due to a lot of metal, and a nice wedge shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. It features clicky buttons and a firm, clicky alert slider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Available finishes include Midnight Black (matte) and Mirror Black (glossier), with a soft white version also available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. It also includes a headphone jack and a dual SIM card tray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Battery and Charging**: Despite lacking wireless charging, the OnePlus 6 offers "A+ battery life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. It combines a 3,300 mAh battery with near-stock Android (OxygenOS), a 1080p AMOLED display, and a Snapdragon 845 processor with 8GB of RAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This configuration provides over six hours of screen-on time daily, often ending the day with 40% battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Dash Charging, still included, is noted as the fastest 0 to 100% charging seen in a phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Display**: The 6.3-inch 1080p Optic AMOLED display, while not Quad HD like some flagships, is considered the best-looking 1080p OLED in any phone currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Its 1080p resolution (2280x1080) significantly benefits battery life and performance by reducing the pixels the GPU needs to push <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. OnePlus also cleverly handles the notch, allowing users to hide it and preventing it from cutting into app real estate by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Software**: OxygenOS is described as fast and smooth, staying close to stock Android while offering useful extra features like super-fast facial recognition, a gaming mode to prevent notifications, and an ambient display mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. The OnePlus 6 was also one of the first phones to be included in the Android P beta program, indicating strong future update support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Performance**: Equipped with a Snapdragon 845, 6 or 8 GB of RAM, and up to 128 GB of storage, the OnePlus 6's specs are described as "ridiculous" for its [[comparison_to_other_phones_in_the_market | price point]], rivaling high-end flagships and definitely surpassing other $500 phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   **Camera (for the price)**: The camera is rated a B-plus overall but an A-plus for its price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. It features a 16-megapixel primary camera with optical stabilization and an f/1.7 aperture, producing nice shots with good detail, low noise, and accurate colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. The second 20-megapixel sensor primarily aids in depth information for portrait mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

### Sacrifices and Value Trade-offs

To achieve its competitive [[comparison_to_other_phones_in_the_market | price]], the OnePlus 6 made conscious choices to omit certain features:

*   **No Expandable Storage**: It has a dual SIM card tray but no microSD card expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50">[02:50]</a>.
*   **Weak Speaker**: The single downward-facing speaker is considered the worst part of the phone's hardware; it's average, tinny at high volumes, and easily blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55">[02:55]</a>. There is no second earpiece speaker for stereo sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06">[03:06]</a>.
*   **Smaller Fingerprint Reader**: The rear fingerprint reader is smaller than previous versions, which can be a minor inconvenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12">[03:12]</a>.
*   **No Wireless Charging**: Despite having a glass back, which typically enables wireless charging, the OnePlus 6 does not include this feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20">[03:20]</a>.
*   **No Official IP Water Resistance**: While OnePlus states it can survive daily splashes, it lacks an official IP67 or IP68 rating for water resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32">[03:32]</a>.
*   **Camera Compared to Flagships**: While excellent for its [[comparison_to_other_phones_in_the_market | price]], the camera does not reach the "A-plus" quality of more expensive flagships like the Pixel 2, iPhone 10, or Galaxy S9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02">[09:02]</a>.

## Conclusion

The OnePlus 6 is described as OnePlus's most polished phone, balancing what to keep versus what to cut to create a quality device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17">[11:17]</a>. It consistently "knocks at the door" of flagship smartphones or is "one small step behind," yet it definitively beats other $500-$600 Android phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26">[10:26]</a>. This strategic trade-off makes it a "great phone for the money" and an "A-plus for the price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37">[11:37]</a>.

From: [[mkbhd]] <br/> 

The latest iPhones, including the [[new_features_of_the_iphone_15_lineup | iPhone 15]] and [[iphone_15_pro_advanced_features | iPhone 15 Pro]] models, introduce a range of new features and design updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Many of these additions fall into two categories: features previously seen in other phones, or ecosystem features exclusive to iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## iPhone 15 and 15 Plus

The [[new_features_of_the_iphone_15_lineup | iPhone 15]] and [[new_features_of_the_iphone_15_lineup | iPhone 15 Plus]] maintain the same two sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Design and Display Updates
*   **Subtle Design Changes**: They feature slight soft corner radii on the aluminum rails and a one-piece glass back that subtly fades between lighter and darker versions of the same color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The entire lineup now has satin soft-touch backs instead of glossy ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Island**: The [[new_features_of_the_iphone_15_lineup | Dynamic Island]], previously exclusive to Pro models, is now included on these baseline iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **Increased Brightness**: The display offers a higher peak brightness of 2,000 nits, which is twice as bright as the [[iphone_14_pro_features_and_innovations | iPhone 14]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### USB-C Connectivity
*   **Port Transition**: A significant change is the adoption of USB-C across all new iPhone models, marking the official end of the Lightning port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This is only the second port change in iPhone history, following the transition from the 30-pin connector to Lightning in [[iphone_12_design_changes | 2012]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Unified Charging**: USB-C enables the use of a single cable to charge various devices, including Macs, iPads, Android phones, and the new AirPods (which now come with a USB-C case) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **Accessory Charging**: iPhones can now charge accessories like the new AirPods via a wired C-to-C cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Data Speeds**: While featuring USB-C, the base [[new_features_of_the_iphone_15_lineup | iPhone 15]] models are limited to USB 2.0 speeds (480 megabits per second), similar to Lightning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

### Camera and Performance
*   **Main Camera**: The primary camera is upgraded to a 48-megapixel sensor, likely the same one found in last year's [[iphone_14_pro_features_and_innovations | iPhone 14 Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Next-Gen Portrait Mode**: A new feature automatically detects subjects in photos and captures depth information, allowing users to apply portrait mode blur retroactively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Processor**: The [[new_features_of_the_iphone_15_lineup | iPhone 15]] inherits the A16 Bionic chip from last year's Pro models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### Pricing
The [[new_features_of_the_iphone_15_lineup | iPhone 15]] starts at $799, and the [[new_features_of_the_iphone_15_lineup | iPhone 15 Plus]] starts at $899 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. They retain the same [[new_features_of_the_iphone_15_lineup | Ceramic Shield]] glass and dust/water resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max

The [[iphone_15_pro_advanced_features | iPhone 15 Pro]] and [[iphone_15_pro_advanced_features | iPhone 15 Pro Max]] introduce more substantial changes, primarily in build quality, chip, and cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Processor: A17 Pro Chip
*   **New Chip Architecture**: The [[iphone_15_pro_advanced_features | iPhone 15 Pro]] models feature the new A17 Pro chip, the first time "Pro" has been used in an iPhone chip name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. It's also Apple's first 3-nanometer chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **Performance Gains**: It promises performance and efficiency improvements, including 10% faster high-performance cores and a neural engine that is up to twice as fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **USB 3 Controller**: A key distinction is the A17 Pro chip's integrated USB 3 controller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. This allows the [[iphone_15_pro_advanced_features | Pro iPhones']] USB-C port to support faster USB 3 data transfer speeds of up to 10 gigabits per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. This is particularly beneficial for transferring large ProRes video or ProRaw photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Charging Speed**: Despite the USB-C transition, the [[iphone_15_pro_advanced_features | iPhone 15 Pro]] models still offer the same 20-watt charging, meaning a full charge can take 1.5 to 2 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### [[iphone_15_pro_design_and_build_changes | Design and Build Changes]]
*   **Titanium Frame**: The Pro models switch from shiny stainless steel rails to a new grade 5 titanium alloy with a brushed texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. This change makes the phones noticeably lighter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   **Reduced Bezels**: The titanium frame also allowed for a slight shrinking of the body and even thinner bezels, bringing the screen closer to the edges while maintaining the same screen sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Durability**: While titanium is stronger, the phones still use the same [[new_features_of_the_iphone_15_lineup | Ceramic Shield]] glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, meaning glass breakage from drops remains a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **[[colors_and_design_changes_in_iphone_15_models | New Colors]]**: [[iphone_15_pro_design_and_build_changes | New colors]] include black, white, a subtle blue, and "natural" which embraces the raw titanium feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Improved Repairability**: Apple has redesigned the interior chassis to make the back glass more easily replaceable, a step towards a more repairable iPhone design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

### [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | Action Button]]
*   **Customizable Button**: The [[iphone_15_pro_advanced_features | iPhone 15 Pro]] introduces a new customizable Action Button, replacing the traditional mute switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Functionality**: By default, it acts as a mute switch, but it can be customized in settings to trigger various functions:
    *   Switching focus modes (e.g., Do Not Disturb) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
    *   Launching the camera in a specific mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
    *   Toggling the flashlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
    *   Opening voice memos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
    *   Toggling the magnifier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
    *   Triggering a Siri Shortcut, which can launch almost any app on the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | Camera Upgrades]]
*   **Main and Ultrawide**: The [[iphone_15_pro_advanced_features | Pro models]] receive a new, larger 48-megapixel main sensor and an improved ultrawide camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **5X Telephoto (Pro Max only)**: The [[iphone_15_pro_advanced_features | iPhone 15 Pro Max]] exclusively features a new intricate folding 5X telephoto camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. The standard [[iphone_15_pro_advanced_features | iPhone 15 Pro]] retains the 3X telephoto lens from the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   **Customizable Default Focal Length**: Users can now change their default focal length in camera settings to 1X, 1.2X, or 1.5X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. This means the 1X button in the camera app will always take you to the chosen default focal length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

### Pricing
The [[iphone_15_pro_advanced_features | iPhone 15 Pro]] starts at $999, the same price as last year's model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. The [[iphone_15_pro_advanced_features | iPhone 15 Pro Max]] has a bumped-up starting price of $1,199, but it also begins with 256GB of storage and includes the exclusive 5X camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

The [[iphone_15_and_15_pro_major_changes | iPhone 15 and 15 Pro models]] introduce new colors, materials, and ports, offering a notable unboxing experience compared to previous generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Unboxing Experience and Included Accessories

All new [[iphone_15_and_15_pro_major_changes | iPhone 15 models]] now ship with a single, white, braided USB-C to USB-C cable, marking the first time iPhones include a braided cable, which is expected to be more durable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

For models sold in the US, there is no SIM card ejector tool included, as all US versions are now eSIM only <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The box also contains paperwork and a single white Apple sticker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Colors and Design Changes [[colors_and_design_changes_in_iphone_15_models | iPhone 15 Models]]

### iPhone 15 and 15 Plus
The standard iPhone 15 and 15 Plus feature "barely blue" and "incredibly pale yellow" color options, characterized by their subtle appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. These phones also introduce a new softer-touch satin finish on the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max
The [[iphone_15_pro_design_and_build_changes | iPhone 15 Pro design and build changes]] include a new dark blue color that borders on gray depending on the light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The iPhone 15 Pro Max is available in a new Natural Titanium color, which is highlighted as a top choice in person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

The Pro models have switched their rail material from shiny stainless steel to brushed titanium, making them approximately 10% lighter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. While lighter, the brushed titanium still shows fingerprints, especially on darker colors like black or blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The new PVD coating on the titanium rails means that deep scratches could reveal the very light Natural Titanium color underneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. For this reason, the Natural Titanium or lighter colors are recommended for the Pro models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### General Design Refinements
All [[iphone_15_and_15_pro_major_changes | iPhone 15 models]] feature slightly softer curves around the phone, including a slight curve at the very edges of the front glass and softer curves on the rails, which improves comfort in hand while maintaining a generally boxy look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. The Pro models also have technically thinner bezels, though this is less noticeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## USB-C Functionality

With the adoption of USB-C, [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | iPhone 15 Pro advanced features]] include the ability to charge accessories directly from the phone's battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Charging Behavior with Other Devices
*   **Older Lightning iPhones:** Plugging an older Lightning iPhone into a USB-C [[iphone_15_and_15_pro_major_changes | iPhone 15]] will always result in the USB-C iPhone providing power to the Lightning iPhone, regardless of charge state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Other USB-C iPhones:** When two USB-C iPhones are connected, they "handshake" to determine which one has the lower battery, and the higher-charged phone will then act as a battery bank for the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Android Phones:** If an Android phone with USB Power Delivery (USB PD) is connected and has more battery, it will act as a battery bank for the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Without USB PD, the charging behavior can be inconsistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. The output is 4.5 watts, suitable for accessories or rescuing another smartphone in a pinch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## Action Button (Pro Models) [[iphone_15_pro_advanced_features | iPhone 15 Pro advanced features]]

The new Action button on the Pro models offers extensive customizability with no apparent restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. The settings UI for the Action button is unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Functionality
*   **Default:** The Action button defaults to the mute switch function, providing distinct haptic patterns for mute and unmute actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Pre-programmed Options:** It can be set to open the camera in any mode, activate the flashlight, or trigger a voice memo that immediately starts recording upon press and hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **Siri Shortcuts:** The most versatile function is Siri Shortcuts, allowing users to map the button to complex, location-dependent actions, call specific contacts, or instantly open any app with zero lag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. For example, it can be mapped to Google Assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Future Wishes:** There's a desire for Apple to add options for double or triple press functions to the Action button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

The Action button maintains a nice, clicky feel even when used with cases, such as the dbrand Ghost case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

## Camera Improvements [[camera_improvements_in_iphone_15_series | Camera improvements in iPhone 15 series]]

A new coating over the lenses on the Pro phones was mentioned during the keynote, but it regrettably does not fix the issue of horrible nighttime lens flare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

On the Pro models, the camera's 1x, 1.2x, and 1.5x zoom options are not merely digital crops but are closer to a set of "Super Res Zoom presets" that allow for further digital zooming between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

## Performance and Battery

The Pro models feature the new A17 Pro chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Additionally, batteries across the entire [[iphone_15_and_15_pro_major_changes | iPhone 15 lineup]] appear to be slightly larger, which is a positive change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

## Overall Impressions

The base [[iphone_15_and_15_pro_major_changes | iPhone 15 models]] represent a more significant improvement than they might seem on paper, as they incorporate features from last year's Pro phones, making them very solid devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. The Pro models, however, are more interesting due to genuinely new innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

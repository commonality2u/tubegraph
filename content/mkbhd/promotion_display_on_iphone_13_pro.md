The [[iphone_13_pro_screen_improvements | iPhone 13 Pro]] and [[iphone_13_pro_screen_improvements | iPhone 13 Pro]] Max models have received a significant display update, finally incorporating a 120Hz refresh rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. This new feature is referred to as a ProMotion display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

## Key Features

### Variable Refresh Rate
The ProMotion display features a variable refresh rate, capable of adjusting from 10Hz all the way up to 120Hz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This adaptive technology allows the display to optimize power consumption by lowering the refresh rate when high refresh rates are not needed, such as when viewing static content.

### Battery Life Expectations
Despite incorporating a brighter, 120Hz display, Apple anticipates slightly better battery life for the Pro phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Users can expect an improvement of one and a half to two and a half hours of use, depending on the specific model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This indicates that the new display technology is not expected to negatively impact battery longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

## Impact and Differentiation
The inclusion of the ProMotion display serves as a significant differentiator between the standard iPhone 13 models and the [[iphone_13_pro_screen_improvements | iPhone 13 Pro]] models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. It will be a key test to see if general users actively notice and desire this 120Hz upgrade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. While many are expected to notice the difference, its impact on upgrade decisions remains to be fully seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

The reviewer expresses enthusiasm for a good 120Hz screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>, suggesting it could be a compelling reason for users with older iPhones, including those up to the [[iphone_11_pro_display_features | iPhone 11 Pro]] or [[iphone_12_pro_features | iPhone 12]], to consider upgrading to a Pro model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

The display of the [[iphone_12_pro_features | iPhone 12 Pro]] has historically been an area of significant debate among users and reviewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. Apple often ships iPhones with screen specifications that, on paper, may not match competitors, leading to online discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## Display Specifications

The [[iphone_12_pro_features | iPhone 12 Pro]] features a flat 6.1-inch diagonal OLED display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Its resolution is 2532 by 1170, resulting in an "awesome" 460 pixels per inch (PPI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. This OLED panel achieves a maximum brightness of 1200 nits, supporting HDR certification and boasting a 2 million to 1 contrast ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. It also supports the wide P3 color gamut and True Tone for automatic white balance adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. The screen is protected by a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

## The Notch

A prominent feature of the [[iphone_12_pro_features | iPhone 12 Pro]] display is its large notch at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. Functionally, the notch houses Face ID components, which include an infrared dot projector, a receiver, an ambient light sensor, a 7-megapixel selfie camera, an earpiece speaker, and a microphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. While other phones have progressively shrunk their notches or moved to hole-punch designs, the iPhone's notch has remained the same size since the [[iphone_x_display_features_and_performance | iPhone X]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. This means it is still "massive" compared to competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. While personally disliking it, users have largely "gotten used to it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. Rumors suggest it may get "slightly smaller" in future models but is "not going away anytime soon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

The speaker expresses a desire for Face ID to work better at more angles, such as when the phone is on a table, without requiring movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

## Refresh Rate: Still 60Hz

The [[iphone_12_pro_features | iPhone 12 Pro]] display has a refresh rate of 60 hertz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. This makes it, as far as the speaker knows, the "most expensive new phone that doesn't have a high refresh rate display yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

Despite this, the iPhone is considered the "smoothest 60 hertz phone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. This smoothness is partly due to the phone's overall performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a> and significantly due to its 120 hertz touch sample rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. This means the display's touch input layer refreshes twice as often as a standard 60Hz display, making it feel very responsive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

However, the iPhone could still "benefit massively from 120hz display" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>, as seen in the [[ProMotion display on iPhone 13 Pro | iPad Pro]], which has had a 120Hz display since 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. A reason cited for the lack of 120Hz on the [[iphone_12_pro_features | iPhone 12 Pro]] is Apple's inability to find a supplier that could produce enough high-quality 120Hz OLED panels to meet their strict quality control and production volume requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

## Ceramic Shield

Apple introduced a new front display layer called "Ceramic Shield" with the [[iphone_12_pro_features | iPhone 12 Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. This is described as glass with "crystallized reinforcement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. Apple claimed it offered "four times better drop performance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.

However, real-world testing has shown that it still scratches at a level 6, with deeper grooves at a level 7, and "will still shatter when dropped" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. The speaker concludes it is "not some magical next level solution" and that "glass is glass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. Any observed improvement in drop performance is more likely due to the new flat design, where the rails absorb more impact, rather than the "magic of some ceramic shield" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

A fun fact is that the perfectly flat display makes the [[iphone_12_pro_features | iPhone 12 Pro]] "the easiest new phone to apply a screen protector to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

## Overall Display Impressions

In summary, the [[iphone_12_pro_features | iPhone 12 Pro]]'s display is considered "incredible on paper," offering "great color accuracy," a flat surface, and plenty of brightness and sharpness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. Despite its technical strengths, it still features a "huge notch at the top," is "stuck at 60 hertz," and "scratches as easily as ever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. This is considered "par for the course" for an iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

### Controversies and "Gates"

The speaker notes that the [[iphone_12_pro_features | iPhone 12 Pro]] generation has been "pretty quiet" in terms of widespread controversies or "gates" that have plagued previous iPhone releases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>. Past examples of "gates" include issues like "antenna gate" or "bend gate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>.

Despite the lack of major issues, the display itself presents some points of contention that could be seen as a "gate" for some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>:
*   It's a "thousand dollar phone with a comically big notch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:37">[00:41:37]</a>.
*   It's "somehow still 60 hertz" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.
*   There have been "occasional bubbling up of OLED tint issues," with some users reporting "green tint on the iPhone's display," though this hasn't been widespread enough for Apple to officially respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>.

The definition of a "gate" is something significant enough to elicit a response from Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>. The speaker ultimately identifies the exclusion of the charger from the box, and its ripple effect on the industry, as the most significant "gate" for this iPhone generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>.

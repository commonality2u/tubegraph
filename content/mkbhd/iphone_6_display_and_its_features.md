The [[iphone_6_47_inch_display | iPhone 6]] was introduced with a new design theme emphasizing thinness and lightness, making it feel significantly different from previous models like the iPhone 5s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This new physical design also brought changes to the display, which became a primary advantage over older iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Overview
The main physical advantage of the [[iPhone 6 | iPhone 6]] over older iPhone models is its larger screen size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This bigger display inherently offers advantages such as larger icons, a bigger user interface, bigger text, and enhanced experiences for web browsing, gaming, video watching, and keyboard use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Technical Specifications
The [[iPhone 6 | iPhone 6]] features a 4.7-inch IPS display with a resolution of 1334 by 750 pixels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. It is noted for its awesome colors, great brightness, and incredible viewing angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. The display boasts a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch (ppi), which is considered quite high and is the same as the iPhone 5 and 5s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## Software Integration and Features
iOS 8 is optimized to utilize the entire display by scaling everything up from the iPhone 5s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. However, there aren't many extra features in iOS specifically designed to leverage the larger display, such as multitasking features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### Reachability
One specific feature implemented for the larger display is "Reachability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This feature aims to make one-handed use easier by allowing users to double-touch the home button, which moves the UI halfway down the display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This helps in interacting with the top half of the screen, reaching top corner buttons in apps, or pulling down the notification bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Criticisms and Wishes
Despite being a great display, there's a desire for Apple to have done more to take advantage of its size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Suggestions include showing more apps in the multitasking menu or making touch targets bigger in first-party applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Additionally, applications that have not been updated for the larger display appear "big and awkward and fuzzy and strange" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

## Comparison with iPhone 6 Plus
The [[iPhone 6 | iPhone 6]] has a companion model, the iPhone 6 Plus, which features a 5.5-inch display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Factors that make the [[iPhone 6 | iPhone 6]] slippery and somewhat difficult to hold are amplified on the even larger iPhone 6 Plus, making it more challenging to grip due to its rounded edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

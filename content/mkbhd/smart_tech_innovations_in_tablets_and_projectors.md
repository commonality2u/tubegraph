The world of technology continues to evolve, bringing forth "dope tech" that combines innovation with practical (and sometimes "extra") features. This includes advancements in wireless charging, smart projectors, and high-end tablets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Xiaomi Smart Wireless Charging Pad

Honored as the "most extra tech feature," the Xiaomi Smart Wireless Charging Pad introduces an innovative approach to device charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
Released alongside the Xiaomi Mi 10 Ultra phone, this large pad initially appears inconspicuous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

### Key Innovation
The pad's primary "gimmick" is its ability to automatically move an internal 20-watt charging coil to locate and align with a device placed anywhere on its surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Users can hear the motors adjust the coil for optimal charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This feature eliminates the need for precise alignment, allowing users to simply "slap it down anywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### Multi-Device Support
While not simultaneously charging multiple devices, the pad can sequentially charge several items. After one device is fully charged, the coil moves to charge the next device placed on the pad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This allows for overnight charging of multiple devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

*   **Touch Screen Projection:** A key innovation is its 10-point multi-touch projection, transforming any flat surface into a giant tablet experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The responsiveness is noted as impressive, surpassing previous gimmicky versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Users must be mindful not to cast a shadow on the projected element they wish to interact with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Portability:** With a built-in battery, the [[Hachi Infinite M1 Smart Projector | Hachi Infinite M1 Smart Projector]] is highly portable, allowing use on the go without needing a power outlet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

### Diverse Applications
The touch projection capabilities enable a variety of uses:
*   **Multiplayer Gaming:** It supports 1v1 multiplayer games such as tic-tac-toe, board games, Pong, and air hockey on any flat surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **AI-Integrated Apps:** The Infinite OS includes dedicated AI-integrated apps:
    *   **Education Feature:** Uses image recognition to identify physical objects, like plastic letters, to teach spelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
    *   **Future Kitchen:** Projects recipes onto kitchen counters or cutting boards and uses the camera to recognize ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
    *   **Fitness App:** Projects workout videos onto a wall while using its camera to monitor and correct user form, count reps, and track body movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

Priced at $999, the [[Hachi Infinite M1 Smart Projector | Hachi Infinite M1 Smart Projector]] is positioned as a "Swiss army knife" smart projector, offering a broad range of interactive and AI-focused functionalities beyond traditional projection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## [[Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 Plus Overview | Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 Plus]]

The [[Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 Plus Overview | Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 Plus]] is presented as a strong contender in the premium Android tablet market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### Performance and Design
*   **High-End Specifications:** It features a Snapdragon 865 Plus processor, enabling 5G connectivity, up to 8GB of RAM, and half a terabyte of storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   **Sleek Build:** The tablet boasts a thin, metal design with sharp edges, quad speakers in all four corners, and a large 10,090 mAh battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Thoughtful Ergonomics:** It includes dual rear cameras (12MP primary, 5MP ultrawide) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. The front-facing camera is centrally located in landscape mode, which is ideal for video calls, as tablets are frequently used horizontally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Similarly, the fingerprint reader is conveniently placed on the right side for easy access when held sideways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. The bezels are thin but provide enough space for comfortable gripping without accidental screen touches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

### S Pen
The improved S Pen, included with the tablet, features the same enhanced technologies as the Galaxy Note series, offering a low 9-millisecond response time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. However, its attachment and charging mechanism on the back requires specific alignment (tip facing the cameras) and the magnets are not as strong as competitors, potentially causing the tablet to sit unevenly when laid flat without a case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

### Superior Display
The standout feature of the [[Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 Plus Overview | Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 Plus]] is its screen, considered the "best screen on any tablet, including the iPad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
*   **Specifications:** It's a 12-inch, 16:10, 120Hz Super AMOLED display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **Visual Quality:** The display offers exceptional brightness, excellent colors, and incredibly sharp, vibrant visuals for videos, photos, and games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. It supports full Quad HD resolution and 120Hz refresh rate simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. This makes it an ideal "media machine" for consuming content on the go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

Despite the common "partially unoptimized" apps often found in the Android tablet ecosystem, the [[Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 Plus Overview | Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 Plus]]'s screen is highlighted as a compelling reason to consider the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

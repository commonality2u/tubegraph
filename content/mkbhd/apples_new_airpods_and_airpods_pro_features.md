Apple announced updates to its AirPods lineup during a recent event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## AirPods 4
The new base [[airpods_pro_design_and_features | AirPods]] 4 have been redesigned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
There are two versions available:
*   **$129 Version**: Features the new shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   **$179 Version**: Includes active noise cancellation (ANC), a wireless charging case, and a tiny speaker built-in for Find My <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

The new shape may fit better in some users' ears compared to older models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:0">[00:11:0]</a>. These [[airpods_pro_design_and_features | AirPods]] offer active noise cancellation and a 4-hour battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

## AirPods Pro 2
The [[airpods_pro_2_design_and_new_features | AirPods Pro 2]] did not receive many technically new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. However, they have been certified as a clinical-grade hearing aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. Additional hearing protection and testing features have also been added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

## AirPods Max
The [[airpods_max_features_and_smart_capabilities | AirPods Max]], originally launched in 2020 at $550, retain the same price in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
Updates for the [[airpods_max_features_and_smart_capabilities | AirPods Max]] are minimal:
*   **New Colors**: Five new colors have been introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **USB-C Port**: They now feature a USB-C port, replacing the previous Lightning port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

Despite these changes, the [[airpods_max_features_and_smart_capabilities | AirPods Max]] still lack an on/off button and retain the original smart case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. They also continue to use the H1 chip, while other [[airpods_pro_design_and_features | AirPods]] models have transitioned to the H2 chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

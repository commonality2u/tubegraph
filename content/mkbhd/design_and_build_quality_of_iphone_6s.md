The [[Design and build quality of iPhone 6s | iPhone 6s]] largely retains the design of the [[iPhone 6 design and build quality | iPhone 6]], making it initially difficult to distinguish the two at first glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The external design is "nearly the same" and "super familiar" to [[iPhone 6 design and build quality | iPhone 6]] users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## External Design Differences

A key differentiator for the [[Design and build quality of iPhone 6s | iPhone 6s]] is the absence of FCC markings on the bottom, which were present on the [[iPhone 6 design and build quality | iPhone 6]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This change allows for a cleaner aesthetic on the [[Design and build quality of iPhone 6s | 6s]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The [[Design and build quality of iPhone 6s | iPhone 6s]] also includes an 'S' badge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, though some find it appears "a little bit out of place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

The most noticeable way to identify a new [[Design and build quality of iPhone 6s | iPhone 6s]] is its new "pink" color, which is also referred to as "rose gold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Build Materials and Durability

A significant improvement in the [[Design and build quality of iPhone 6s | iPhone 6s]] is Apple's use of 7000 series aluminum for the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This material provides a stronger body, making the phone less prone to bending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Additionally, the internal structure around the volume buttons, where bending issues were previously observed, has been reinforced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Ergonomics and Dimensions

The [[Design and build quality of iPhone 6s | iPhone 6s]] retains the rounded shape of the [[iPhone 6 design and build quality | iPhone 6]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This rounded design can make the device feel "a bit slippery in the hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

The [[Design and build quality of iPhone 6s | iPhone 6s]] is slightly thicker, taller, and wider than the [[iPhone 6 design and build quality | iPhone 6]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This dimensional change means that cases and skins designed for the [[iPhone 6 design and build quality | iPhone 6]] may not fit the [[Design and build quality of iPhone 6s | 6s]] precisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

Button placement, headphone jack, and mute switch remain in the same locations as on the [[iPhone 6 design and build quality | iPhone 6]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Touch ID

The [[Design and build quality of iPhone 6s | iPhone 6s]] features a new, significantly faster Touch ID fingerprint sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. It is so quick that users might miss notifications on the lock screen because the phone unlocks almost instantly upon touching the home button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The sensor can read a fingerprint with just a tap, without needing to hold the button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Display and 3D Touch Hardware

While the display panel specifications (1334x750 IPS on [[Design and build quality of iPhone 6s | iPhone 6s]], 1080p LCD on [[Design and build quality of iPhone 6s | 6s Plus]]) remain the same as the previous generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, the [[Design and build quality of iPhone 6s | 6s]] display incorporates new hardware for pressure sensitivity, known as 3D Touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This feature allows for multiple layers of pressure detection, enabling "peek and pop" functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. When an app does not support 3D Touch, the new haptic engine provides a quick triple buzz, blurring the edges of the icon to indicate no further action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## Camera Hardware

The [[Design and build quality of iPhone 6s | iPhone 6s]] is equipped with a new 12-megapixel camera sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. The flash and most optics are similar to the previous model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. The [[Design and build quality of iPhone 6s | iPhone 6s Plus]] also benefits from optical image stabilization, which aids in cleaner low-light photos and smoother video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. The increase to 12 megapixels allows the [[Design and build quality of iPhone 6s | iPhone]] to shoot 4K video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

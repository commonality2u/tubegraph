Huawei, a massive China-based technology company, operates various businesses, including networking equipment, computers, and smartphones, holding the position of the second-largest smartphone vendor globally by market share, behind Samsung and ahead of Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### [[huawei_and_us_trade_restrictions | US Trade Restrictions and Google Ban]]

The [[huawei_and_us_trade_restrictions | US and China have been escalating this trade war]] for several months, alongside historical security concerns regarding the potential for U.S. companies buying Huawei networking equipment to be spied on by the Chinese government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. U.S. government agencies were even banned from purchasing Huawei phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

The U.S. government signed an executive order, effective May 2019, adding Huawei to a blacklist that restricts it from engaging in [[huaweis_business_relationships_with_us_companies | any business with any U.S. company]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. As a direct consequence, Google, a U.S. company, complied by halting all business with Huawei and revoking its license to use Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This means Huawei is unable to purchase software or licenses from U.S. companies, including Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

This situation is particularly challenging for Huawei, which had been the fastest-growing smartphone manufacturer globally and was rapidly approaching the number one market position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Impact on Existing Huawei Devices

For existing Huawei devices (including the Honor sub-brand), a 90-day exemption was issued, allowing the company to continue providing software and security updates until August 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Google also confirmed via its Android account that services like Google Play and security from Google Play Protect would continue to function on existing Huawei devices for the time being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

However, if the restrictions remain, these phones will likely stop receiving software updates after the 90-day extension, meaning they will be stuck on their current Android software version for their lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### Challenges for Future Huawei Devices

The primary questions for future Huawei devices revolve around hardware and software availability without U.S. business ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

#### Hardware
Huawei spent $70 billion on hardware components in the previous year, with $11 billion going to U.S. companies like Qualcomm and Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Many essential components, such as Gorilla Glass, flash storage, and some radios, are sourced from U.S. companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. While Huawei could theoretically switch all suppliers to non-U.S. companies, it would be an expensive and arduous process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Notably, Huawei manufactures its own Kirin 980 chip, reducing reliance on Qualcomm for silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Bloomberg reported that Huawei had stockpiled a three-month supply of preferred parts in anticipation of the ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

#### Software
The most significant challenge remains software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. While Android itself is open-source (AOSP), using bare-bones Android is not ideal as it lacks Google services like Gmail and YouTube, and critically, the Google Play Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

Huawei has reportedly been preparing for this scenario by quietly developing [[huaweis_alternative_strategies_and_challenges | a backup OS]] that supports Android apps and building its own app store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. However, launching an alternative OS and app store is an immense challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Without business ties to U.S. companies, Huawei cannot easily secure popular apps like Netflix, Pandora, Facebook, and Instagram for its alternative app store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Previous attempts by large companies like Amazon to create their own app stores have shown how difficult it is to compete with established platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

This also impacts Huawei's laptop business; without access to Microsoft Windows, Intel processors, and Nvidia graphics cards, Huawei cannot continue producing competitive Windows laptops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### Impact on the [[impact_on_the_smartphone_market | Smartphone Market]]

The loss of Huawei as a major player means reduced competition in the [[impact_on_the_smartphone_market | smartphone market]], which can lead to less innovation and less incentive for companies to produce high-quality products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Huawei's strong performance has positively influenced the overall quality of phones in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

The ban also negatively impacts the future of [[overview_of_folding_smartphones_in_2020 | folding phones]], specifically the Huawei Mate X, which was anticipated to be a significant entrant after the Samsung Galaxy Fold's initial issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The Mate X's potential inability to run Android further complicates its market viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

### [[user_perception_and_future_of_foldable_phones | Consumer Perception]]

Even if Huawei manages to overcome the technical challenges, a significant long-term impact is on [[user_perception_and_future_of_foldable_phones | how people perceive Huawei]] as a company to buy products from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. The company's [[user_perception_and_future_of_foldable_phones | reputation isn't exactly great especially in the US]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Convincing consumers to spend hundreds of dollars on a Huawei phone that lacks the Play Store or full Android functionality will be a tough sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

A similar situation occurred with ZTE in 2018, where they were cut off from U.S. business relationships and did not recover strongly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. However, Huawei is a much larger company, leading to speculation that its recovery might differ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

The situation remains dynamic and could change, potentially with the executive order being reversed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. As of now, the future of Huawei remains in an "unsatisfying limbo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

The [[Tesla CyberTruck design and features | Tesla Cybertruck]] was revealed approximately four years ago, initially appearing as an enigma, with prototypes later spotted in California and Texas for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The vehicle discussed is a near-final version, representing what customers will receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Its [[Design and Features | design]] features and aesthetics are notable, with some surprising elements and cool features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## General appearance

The Cybertruck is characterized by its giant, stainless steel triangle shape, giving it a surreal appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. There is not a single curve on the entire truck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, with every piece being a large section of stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. The front of the truck features sharp corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, including a large, stamped front piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

### Build Quality and Panel Gaps
Due to the stamping process of stainless steel, which has a "spring back" effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>, there can be variations in panel gaps and overall build quality among Cybertrucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. While the specific truck reviewed looked great with generally small and even panel gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, the large front piece might show some wavering, not being perfectly flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

## Exterior features

Compared to the original show truck, the final version is about 5% smaller in every dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The Cybertruck's length, bumper to bumper, is approximately 224 inches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, making it comparable in size to an [[Design and exterior features of the Ford F150 Lightning | F-150 Lightning]] but slightly smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

*   **Front Trunk (Frunk)**: The Cybertruck features a motorized front trunk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a> that opens automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. It is relatively shallow, capable of fitting about two carry-on suitcases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.
*   **Lights**: The truck has a large daytime running light bar across the front, with the actual headlights integrated as slots below it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.
*   **Windshield Wiper**: It boasts the world's largest windshield wiper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, which, despite its size, covers about 75% of the windshield area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>.
*   **Side View Mirrors**: The truck includes side view mirrors, which are legally required for shipping, but they are designed to be removable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Blind spot monitoring lights are inside the truck, and cameras on the side show the blind spot when the blinker is on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Wheels**: The 20-inch rims come with a removable plastic aero cap that provides a couple of percent more range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. The tires are bespoke Goodyear tires with unique aesthetic and tread tweaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Door Handles**: The Cybertruck has no traditional door handles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Instead, there's an indented button that, when pressed, pushes the door out by about two inches for manual opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. These frameless windows close automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. A concern is fingerprints left on the stainless steel when opening the doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. The rear doors open a full 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.
*   **Truck Bed**: The bed features a dampened tailgate opening, though it is not power-operated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. It has a motorized tonneau cover that can support up to 300 pounds of force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. The bed is fully lined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, measures approximately 66 inches in length, similar to the [[Design and exterior features of the Ford F150 Lightning | F-150 Lightning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>, and includes a sub-trunk with a drain plug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. It also provides bed lighting and a latch system for tie-downs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. There is no spare tire by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

## Interior Design and user experience

The interior of the Cybertruck is characterized by its minimal [[User interface and user experience | design]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.
*   **Steering Wheel**: The only curve in the entire interior is the steering wheel, which is a full wheel rather than a yolk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. It features physical, haptic buttons for controls like blinkers and headlights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>, and a traditional horn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. The steering wheel itself has a Cybertruck-like trapezoid silhouette instead of a Tesla logo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>.
*   **Glass Canopy**: The truck features the single largest piece of glass in the automotive industry, extending from the nose of the car to behind the driver's head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. This provides excellent visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. Removable sunshades with magnetic connectors are also included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
*   **Storage and Features**: The interior offers good door storage (fitting two water bottles), tray storage, two wireless chargers, two cup holders, a large armrest, and significant storage space in the middle console <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. It also includes a 120-volt outlet and a 65-watt USB-C charging port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.
*   **Visibility**: Visibility over the nose of the car is not ideal due to the short nose and distant windshield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.
*   **Lighting and Camera**: The cabin features touch-sensitive lights and ambient RGB lighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>. An interior-facing cabin camera is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>.
*   **Rear View**: When the tonneau cover is closed, rear visibility through the physical mirror is blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. The rear view is displayed on the main screen, requiring a mental "remap" for drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.
*   **Speaker Grills**: All speaker grills in the cabin are trapezoids or squares, with no curves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>.
*   **Gear Selector**: The park, reverse, neutral, and drive gears can be selected via touch-sensitive controls above the driver's head, in addition to on-screen controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>. The hazards button is also touch-sensitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.
*   **Backseat**: The back doors open 90 degrees, offering excellent rear legroom due to the front seats being on rectangular risers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. The rear seats can be completely folded up for additional covered storage space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. There is also a 9.5-inch screen for rear passengers to control seat heating (left and right seats only) and airflow, or watch movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.

## Software User Interface (UI)

The [[User interface and user experience | Cybertruck's software]] features an "all-new cyber UI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. It is themed to match the Cybertruck aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.

*   **Main Screen**: The central 18.5-inch touchscreen is the largest in a Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. It displays a large, real-time model of the Cybertruck in the middle for vehicle controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>.
*   **Interactive Model**: Users can interact with the on-screen model to open the tailgate, tonneau cover, or charge port flap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>. The model updates in real-time, showing window positions or steering wheel turns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.
*   **Ride Height**: Ride height can be adjusted very quickly between entry, low, medium, and high modes, with 12 inches of suspension travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>. Off-road mode offers up to 17 inches of clearance, and "Extract" mode provides the absolute highest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>.
*   **Navigation and Dock**: The screen can display navigation across two-thirds of the screen while keeping vehicle controls on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. A persistent dock at the bottom provides access to frequently used features like heated steering wheel and heated/cooled front seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>.
*   **Glove Box**: The glove box is a drawer opened by a button on the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.

## Driving experience and design impact

The Cybertruck's [[Performance features and driving experience | driving experience]] is heavily influenced by its unique [[Design and Features | design]] choices. It feels like a Tesla with instant throttle response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a> and is notably quiet, thanks to laminated, shatterproof windows that seal out noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.

*   **Visibility**: Despite good overall visibility, the short nose of the truck makes it difficult to see the front from the driver's seat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>.
*   **Steering**: The "steer by wire" system is a first for Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. It maintains the same steering ratio constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a> and offers rear axle steering of up to 10 degrees in the opposite direction at low speeds (under 40 mph) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>, which effectively shortens the wheelbase and allows for tighter turns, making the large truck feel nimble in parking lots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>. At higher speeds (above 40 mph), it turns one or two degrees in the same direction as the front wheels for increased stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>. The total steering turn is less than 180 degrees for maximum turns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>, which requires significant adjustment for drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>.
*   **Suspension**: The suspension is firm but offers a large delta between its firmest and softest settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>. The stainless steel body is torsionally very stiff and rigid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>, allowing the suspension to manage all the effort for softness or firmness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>.
*   **Road Noise**: Despite foam in the tires, some road noise and all-terrain tread feel are noticeable in the cabin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. There is also a "tiny bit of steering feel," which is unusual for Teslas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:14">[00:37:14]</a>.

## Overall perceptions
The Cybertruck's [[design_and_aesthetics_of_the_moto_razr | aesthetic]] is polarizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:42">[00:38:42]</a>. Its powerful performance, especially its rapid acceleration, and the responsive steering are highlighted as major strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. However, its higher-than-expected price, with the triple motor version starting around $100,000, removes its initial perceived price advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>.

The [[Apples new AirPods and AirPods Pro features | AirPods Pro 2]] arrived unexpectedly, but despite initial skepticism, the reviewer found them to be "really good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. While many small new features were introduced, the overall experience was particularly enhanced by the underlying technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Design and Fit
Visually, the [[AirPods Pro design and features | AirPods Pro 2]] maintain a nearly identical design to their predecessor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The only way to differentiate them is by the presence of dual vents at the top of the earbuds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

A new extra small ear tip is now included in the box, alongside the default medium size, two smaller, and one larger size options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This caters to users with smaller ears who might not have had a good fit with previous [[AirPods Pro design and features | AirPods Pro]] models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## [[AirPods Pro sound quality | Sound Quality]]
Internally, the [[Apples new AirPods and AirPods Pro features | AirPods Pro 2]] feature an entirely new driver and amplifier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This results in dramatically better sound compared to the previous generation, making them the best-sounding earbuds Apple has ever produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. There are significantly more lows and mids, which is particularly noticeable for genres with heavy bass like hip-hop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The earbuds exhibit very little high-volume distortion, and the overall sound profile is responsive and crisp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. While they still do not support lossless audio, they deliver good 16-bit 48kHz audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Battery Life
The [[Apples new AirPods and AirPods Pro features | AirPods Pro 2]] boast a 33% longer battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Users can expect 6 hours of listening on a single charge with noise cancellation active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The charging case extends the total listening time to up to 30 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## [[Apples AirPods Pro case | Charging Case]] Enhancements
The [[Apples AirPods Pro case | AirPods Pro 2 case]] maintains the same size and shape as its predecessor but introduces several significant upgrades:

    *   It can play a loud sound to help locate the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
    *   It works with Precision Finding due to the U1 chip, similar to an AirTag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
    *   It plays a sound when placed on a charger (wired or wireless) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
    *   The speaker will chime, and a "mismatched [[Apples new AirPods and AirPods Pro features | AirPods]]" notification will appear on the phone if the wrong earbud is accidentally placed in the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   **Charging Versatility**: The case now supports charging with Apple Watch chargers, in addition to MagSafe wireless charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Durability**: It retains an IPX4 water resistance rating, offering protection against sweat or rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Personalization**: Users can engrave the case with their Memoji <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## On-Earbud Volume Control
A highly requested feature, volume control, is now available directly on the earbud's stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This allows for convenient volume adjustment without needing to access a phone. The gesture involves holding a finger on one side and sliding with the other on the flat spot of the stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## The H2 Chip: The Core of Enhancement
The H2 chip is the primary reason behind the significant improvements in the [[Apples new AirPods and AirPods Pro features | AirPods Pro 2]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This second-generation chip enables all the special features of the new [[Apples new AirPods and AirPods Pro features | AirPods]], including audio processing and noise cancellation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The chip's capabilities facilitate extensive real-time computational audio, which is processed directly on the earbuds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

### Active Noise Cancellation (ANC)
The [[Apples new AirPods and AirPods Pro features | AirPods Pro 2]] feature much improved active noise cancellation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Apple claims it removes up to two times more background noise than the previous generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. This improvement, combined with the new drivers and sound profile, is notably effective at erasing white noise like air conditioners and transportation sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. The ANC is considered to be on par with the Sony Mark IV earbuds and just below the new Bose Quiet Comfort Earbud IIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, and surprisingly, even surpasses the [[AirPods Max Features and Smart Capabilities | AirPods Max]] in terms of noise cancellation effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

### Adaptive Transparency Mode
The H2 chip significantly levels up the transparency mode, now termed Adaptive Transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This mode continues to pass through outside sound in real-time, but it intelligently cuts down loud or harsh sounds exceeding 85 dB to prevent them from hurting the user's ears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. For example, while listening to music or a podcast, an ambulance siren or a jackhammer would still be heard but at a suppressed, safer volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. The system samples outside sound 48,000 times per second, which is 240 times faster than the previous generation, allowing it to reduce sharp, quick sounds like a barking dog almost instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This feature is so effective that it could potentially be used at loud concerts to protect hearing while still enjoying the music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

### Computational Audio and Spatial Audio
[[Apples new AirPods and AirPods Pro features | AirPods Pro]] already utilize computational audio to adjust EQ across different volume levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The H2 chip further enhances this.
A new ear scan feature for personalized spatial audio uses the Face ID depth sensors to measure the user's head and ear depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. This customization aims to provide a personalized spatial audio mix, which for the reviewer, resulted in a slightly wider soundstage with a more spread-out sound and instrumentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

Additionally, the H2 chip allows the [[Apples new AirPods and AirPods Pro features | AirPods Pro 2]] to communicate with the Noise app on the Apple Watch in real-time, showing how much noise is being canceled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

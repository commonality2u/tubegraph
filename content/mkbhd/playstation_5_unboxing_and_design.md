The [[playstation_5_design_and_aesthetics | PlayStation 5]] was one of the most highly anticipated tech products of its release year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This article provides a detailed look at the console's final retail packaging, its initial unboxing experience, and the [[playstation_5_design_and_aesthetics | design]] of the console and its accompanying [[playstation_5_accessories_overview | accessories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Console Unboxing

The [[playstation_5_design_and_aesthetics | PlayStation 5]] arrives in a large box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The front of the packaging displays the console and controller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, indicating it's the version with the optical drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Key specifications such as 8K, 4K 120, or HDR support are also visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The back of the box shows the console oriented sideways, and it lists the storage capacity as 825 GB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

Upon opening, a cardboard box is found at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>, with the console itself nestled in styrofoam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. The initial impression of the console is that it is "huge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a> and "tall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>, but also aesthetically pleasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

## [[playstation_5_design_and_aesthetics | PlayStation 5 Design and Features]]

The [[playstation_5_design_and_aesthetics | PlayStation 5]]'s build is generally well-received upon seeing it in person, moving past initial reactions that likened it to an "alien spaceship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

### Aesthetics and Dimensions
The most striking aspects of the [[playstation_5_design_and_aesthetics | PlayStation 5]] are its immense [[playstation_5_size_and_weight_comparison | size]] and unique textures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. It features a matte finish on its white outer casing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, while the interior is highly glossy, exhibiting reflections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

The texture on the inside of the console is intricately designed, composed of tiny embossed X's, O's, squares, and triangles arranged in a seemingly random pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.

In terms of [[playstation_5_size_and_weight_comparison | size and weight]], the [[playstation_5_design_and_aesthetics | PlayStation 5]] is notably larger and heavier than previous consoles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
*   **Compared to PS4 Pro**: It is thicker, heavier, taller, and wider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.
*   **Compared to Xbox Series X**: The [[playstation_5_design_and_aesthetics | PlayStation 5]] appears to "dwarf" the Xbox Series X, highlighting its significant [[playstation_5_size_and_weight_comparison | footprint]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.

Its [[playstation_5_design_and_aesthetics | design]] has been described as resembling a "fancy building" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. Much of the visible [[playstation_5_design_and_aesthetics | design]] is related to its thermal management, incorporating heat sinks and cooling features to manage the internal components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.

### Ports and Buttons
The console's connectivity options include:
*   **Back**: Power port, one HDMI port, Ethernet port, and two USB ports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. A Kensington lock slot is located at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.
*   **Front**: A full-size USB port and a USB Type-C port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.
*   **Bottom**: Disk eject button and power button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. The digital-only version lacks the eject button and its side is blank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

## Included [[playstation_5_accessories_overview | Accessories]]

The [[playstation_5_design_and_aesthetics | PlayStation 5]] console comes with several essential [[playstation_5_accessories_overview | accessories]]:
*   **Power Cable**: Plugs directly into the wall, without an external power brick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
*   **DualSense Wireless Controller**: One new controller is included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.
*   **Paperwork**: Standard safety guide and quick start guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
*   **HDMI Cable** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.
*   **Dock**: A plastic dock is required to lay the [[playstation_5_design_and_aesthetics | PS5]] flat on its side, as the console does not have flat sides on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

## [[playstation_5_accessories_overview | DualSense Wireless Controller]]

The [[playstation_5_accessories_overview | DualSense wireless controller]] continues the console's aesthetic with a "stormtrooper white" color scheme and blue accents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

### Ergonomics and Features
The controller is praised for its feel, being larger and more solid than the PS4 controller, fitting well in the hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. It is more comfortable, with slightly longer stems, yet remains lightweight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. The button layout remains largely the same: triangle, square, circle, X on the right; arrows on the left; a trackpad in the middle; and dual joysticks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.

Key features include:
*   **Battery**: A built-in, rechargeable 1500 mAh battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.
*   **Charging**: Charges via USB-C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.
*   **Haptic Feedback & Triggers**: Features improved haptic feedback and more responsive triggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>, which are noted to be "a little more firm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.
*   **Audio**: Includes a microphone at the bottom and a speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.
*   **LED Light**: The LED light has moved from the back of the controller to behind the trackpad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.
*   **Charging Pins**: Pins near the headphone jack at the bottom allow for docked charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.

The most notable [[playstation_5_design_and_aesthetics | design]] element is the texture on the back of the controller, which, like the console, is made up of tiny embossed X's, O's, squares, and triangles, providing additional grip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.

## [[playstation_5_accessories_overview | DualSense Charging Station]]

Sony offers a dedicated [[playstation_5_accessories_overview | DualSense charging station]] that can charge two controllers simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. It includes the dock itself and a long power cable with a brick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>. Controllers are placed upright, aligning pins at the bottom with the charger's pins, allowing the charging LED color behind the trackpad to be visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. This accessory frees up USB ports on the console <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. While the click-in mechanism is satisfying, a heavier base or magnetic charging (like MagSafe technology) would enhance the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>.

## [[playstation_5_headset_and_camera_features | Pulse 3D Wireless Headset]]

The new [[playstation_5_headset_and_camera_features | Pulse 3D wireless headset]] features a "super minimal" white and black [[playstation_5_design_and_aesthetics | design]] consistent with the PlayStation aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. It supports 3D audio in compatible games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>.

Key features include:
*   **Microphones**: Dual microphones for improved audio quality and noise cancellation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>.
*   **Battery Life**: Promises a 12-hour battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.
*   **Charging**: Uses USB-C for charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.
*   **Connectivity**: Features a 3.5mm headphone jack to plug into the controller and a USB dongle for wireless connection to the console or other devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.
*   **Material**: Mostly plastic construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>.
*   **Design**: Features a unique dual-band [[playstation_5_design_and_aesthetics | design]] with a sliding rubber band for fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>.
*   **Comfort**: Thick, soft, and comfortable ear cushions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>, and the headset is lightweight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.
*   **Controls**: All controls, including USB-C charging, microphone mute button, sliding power, and LED indicator, are located on the left ear cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.

## [[playstation_5_headset_and_camera_features | HD Camera]]

The [[playstation_5_headset_and_camera_features | HD Camera]] is expected to be the least purchased first-party [[playstation_5_accessories_overview | accessory]], but is designed for game streamers, offering seamless integration and matching the console's [[playstation_5_design_and_aesthetics | aesthetic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>. It is a 1080p camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a> with a built-in white stand that allows for angle adjustment, enabling placement above or below a TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>.

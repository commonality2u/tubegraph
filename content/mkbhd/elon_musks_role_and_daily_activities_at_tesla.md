Elon Musk is widely recognized as the "boss," the "face of Tesla," and the primary "decision maker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. His daily activities at Tesla largely revolve around the company's core operations, focusing primarily on design, engineering, and [[production_process_and_assembly_lines_at_tesla | production]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Time Allocation

Musk states that approximately "89% of the time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a> is spent in the factory, attending design or engineering meetings, or directly involved in [[production_process_and_assembly_lines_at_tesla | production]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. He clarifies that contrary to popular belief, he spends "almost nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a> on [[elons_tweets_and_public_reactions | Twitter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

Most of his time is spent "going around the factory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a> and working directly on various stages of vehicle manufacturing:
*   The paint shop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>
*   The body shop, where the body is welded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>
*   Final assembly, where all parts are put together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>

When not at the main [[production_process_and_assembly_lines_at_tesla | Tesla factory]], he is typically at the [[production_process_and_assembly_lines_at_tesla | Gigafactory]] in Nevada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Company Philosophy and Product Focus

Musk emphasizes that Tesla's primary focus is to "make the [[innovations_and_future_products_from_tesla | product]] as compelling as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. He believes the most effective way to sell any [[innovations_and_future_products_from_tesla | product]] is through [[teslas_approach_to_marketing_and_product_excitement | word of mouth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, requiring customers to "love" the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Tesla does not spend money on [[teslas_approach_to_marketing_and_product_excitement | advertising]] or endorsements, with customers buying cars because they genuinely like them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. He even pays "full retail price for my own cars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

A significant goal is to make cars more affordable by achieving higher volume and economies of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. He notes that the car industry is "insanely competitive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Strategic Product Development

Musk acknowledges that Tesla often has "way more product ideas than we have resources to execute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Historically, Tesla focused on developing "one car at a time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Looking ahead, the company aims to develop two [[innovations_and_future_products_from_tesla | products]] concurrently, ensuring both maintain high quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. If successful, they might then attempt to develop three [[innovations_and_future_products_from_tesla | products]] at a time, although other manufacturers commonly manage twelve simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

Musk also shares that the Tesla team are "basically a bunch of nerds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>, and they aim to provide "expert user mode" features like Track Mode, which allows users to adjust settings such as traction control and battery temperature, with clear warnings about potential risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

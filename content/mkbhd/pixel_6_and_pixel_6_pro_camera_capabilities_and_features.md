The Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro mark a significant departure from previous Pixel generations, featuring a brand new camera system and Google's custom-designed [[tensor_chip_performance_in_pixel_6_and_6_pro | Tensor chip]] to enhance computational photography [00:00:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, [00:01:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>). While previous Pixels were known for their great cameras and software features despite lackluster hardware, the Pixel 6 series introduces a substantial hardware upgrade to compete with other flagships [00:00:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, [00:00:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, [00:01:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>).

## Camera Hardware
The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro feature a new camera system with significantly improved hardware [00:01:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>).

*   **Main Sensor**: A large 50-megapixel main sensor is included on both phones [00:01:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>). While it's a 50MP sensor, photos are always binned down to 12.5 megapixels, with no high-res mode available to capture full 50MP images [00:01:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>). This offers only a small improvement in sharpness over previous Pixel cameras [00:01:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, [00:01:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, [00:01:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>).
*   **Ultrawide Camera**: A new 12-megapixel ultrawide lens is also present on both models [00:01:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>). This ultrawide camera performs similarly to previous Pixel ultrawides, but it lacks a macro mode [00:16:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>).
*   **Telephoto Camera (Pro model only)**: The Pixel 6 Pro exclusively features a 4x telephoto camera [00:02:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, [00:14:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>). This telephoto lens is "surprisingly good" for handheld shooting [00:16:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>).
*   **Selfie Camera**:
    *   **Pixel 6**: Equipped with a decent 8-megapixel wide selfie camera [00:04:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>).
    *   **Pixel 6 Pro**: Features an 11-megapixel ultrawide selfie camera, which is preferred for fitting more people in the frame and can shoot 4K selfie video [00:04:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, [00:05:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>).

The distinctive camera bar design of the [[pixel_6_and_pixel_6_pro_design_and_hardware | Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro design and hardware]] is functional, allowing an index finger to rest nicely underneath it and preventing the phone from rocking on a table [00:01:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, [00:02:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>).

## Computational Photography and Software Features
The [[tensor_chip_performance_in_pixel_6_and_6_pro | Tensor chip]] enables advanced machine learning and AI for better computational photography [00:05:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, [00:05:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>). Google's approach to camera processing has historically compensated for smaller sensors with incredible software, HDR, and multi-frame bracketing [00:13:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>, [00:13:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>).

### Magic Eraser
A new feature in Google Photos for Pixel 6 allows users to remove unwanted objects from any picture in their library [00:08:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>, [00:08:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>).
*   It simplifies content-aware fill, automatically selecting potential photobombers or background elements to remove [00:08:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, [00:08:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>).
*   Users can also draw a rough outline around objects, and the feature will auto-detect edges and remove them [00:08:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>).
*   It works best with simple, repeating backgrounds (gradients, textures) and high contrast [00:09:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>). It struggles with large objects in front of complex or varied backgrounds [00:09:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>, [00:09:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>). This feature demonstrates the power of the AI in the [[tensor_chip_performance_in_pixel_6_and_6_pro | Tensor chip]] [00:09:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>).

### Face Unblur
The ultrawide camera on the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro continuously runs at a higher shutter speed when faces are present in a shot [00:19:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>). If the primary camera captures a blurry face, it can merge a sharper face from the ultrawide camera into the final shot automatically, preventing blurry faces in photos [00:19:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>, [00:19:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>, [00:19:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>, [00:19:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>).

### Other AI/ML Enhancements
*   **Speech-to-Text**: While not directly a camera feature, the improved speech-to-text functionality, powered by [[tensor_chip_performance_in_pixel_6_and_6_pro | Tensor chip]], highlights the phone's overall AI capabilities. It accurately transcribes speech at high speeds, adds punctuation, pulls names from contacts, and understands commands like "delete this" or "send" [00:07:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, [00:07:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>), [00:07:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>), [00:08:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>), [00:08:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>).
*   **Live Captioning**: The Pixel can provide real-time live captioning for videos, phone calls, and movies [00:17:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>, [00:17:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>).

## Image Quality and Processing
Pixel phones have historically relied on advanced software and computational photography to achieve impressive image quality [00:13:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>). With the new hardware, Google's algorithms still run "at 11," leading to some distinct characteristics:
*   **Over-processing**: Photos can sometimes appear "over-processed" or "over-HDR-y" because the algorithms, previously used to compensate for smaller sensors, are now applied to much better hardware [00:14:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>, [00:14:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>, [00:14:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>, [00:14:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>).
*   **Sharpness and White Balance**: Photos are generally sharp, and white balance is good, though it can sometimes lean a bit too cool [00:14:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, [00:14:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>).
*   **HDR**: The Pixel performs an "enormous amount of HDR" [00:14:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>). Shadows rarely go completely black, and highlights like the sky are seldom blown out, making it look like the clarity slider in Photoshop was turned up too high [00:14:59](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>, [00:15:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>, [00:15:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>).
*   **High Dynamic Range Situations**: The large sensor excels in difficult high dynamic range situations, such as shooting directly into the sun or at night with bright lights [00:15:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>, [00:15:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>, [00:15:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>, [00:15:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>).
*   **Night Sight**: Nighttime shots are sharp with almost no noise [00:15:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>, [00:15:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>). However, they can appear too bright, sometimes turning "night into day" compared to the [[iphone_13_pro_camera_capabilities | iPhone 13 Pro]] [00:15:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>, [00:15:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>). Darker scenes also tend to overexpose if the exposure slider in the viewfinder isn't adjusted [00:15:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>, [00:15:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>).
*   **Super Res Zoom**: Google's Super Res Zoom can sharpen and improve normally soft zoomed shots, but at extreme zoom levels, they can still resemble "watercolor paintings" [00:16:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>, [00:16:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>, [00:16:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>). The [[samsung_galaxy_s21_ultra_camera_features | Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra]] generally provides better sharpness in zoomed photos [00:16:43](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>, [00:16:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>).

## Video Capabilities
The video quality on the Pixel 6 has significantly improved [00:17:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>).
*   Video shares the same processing style as photos, featuring great dynamic range and stabilization [00:17:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>, [00:17:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>).
*   The large sensor produces real background blur [00:17:58](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>, [00:18:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>).
*   Focus is impressively maintained most of the time [00:18:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>).
*   In challenging scenes, the processing is visible, sometimes leading to noise when attempting to brighten shadows [00:18:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>, [00:18:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>, [00:18:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>).
*   Overall, color, exposure, white balance, and details in Pixel 6 video are excellent [00:18:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>, [00:18:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>).

## Camera User Experience
The Pixel's viewfinder experience is unique due to the [[tensor_chip_performance_in_pixel_6_and_6_pro | Tensor chip]]'s processing power [00:18:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>, [00:18:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>).
*   The Pixel significantly boosts ISO in the viewfinder, resulting in a noisy preview, especially for selfies [00:18:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>, [00:18:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>, [00:18:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>). This is done to maintain a high frame rate and shutter speed [00:18:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>, [00:18:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>).
*   After capturing the photo, the processing kicks in, sharpening everything and making the final image appear "miles better" than the noisy preview [00:18:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>, [00:18:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>). This approach allows the phone to "under promise and over deliver" [00:19:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>, [00:19:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>).

## Comparison and Conclusion
While the Pixel 6 camera can produce "incredible sharp photos" [00:17:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>), it also yields "weird looking ones" due to over-processing [00:17:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>, [00:17:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>, [00:17:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>).

The reviewer concludes that the [[iphone_13_pro_camera_capabilities | iPhone 13 Pro]] camera system is currently better than the Pixel's, primarily due to its consistency [00:17:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>, [00:19:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>, [00:19:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>). The iPhone consistently delivers 9/10 shots [00:17:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>, [00:17:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>), while the Pixel's performance can fluctuate between 10/10 "aces" and 7/10 "weird looking" or "over-HDR" shots that users might not want to share [00:17:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>, [00:17:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>, [00:17:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, [00:17:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>, [00:17:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>).

However, the hardware in the Pixel 6 is described as "so good" that there is hope for future software updates to improve consistency and make it a 10/10 camera more often [00:19:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>, [00:19:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>, [00:19:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>).

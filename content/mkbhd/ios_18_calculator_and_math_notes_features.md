The Calculator app in [[ios_18_control_center | iOS 18]] introduces significant new functionalities, including a new Math Notes feature that transforms how users interact with mathematical calculations on their devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. This feature, initially showcased for iPadOS 18, is also available on the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

## Calculator Modes
Upon opening the Calculator app, users are presented with a basic calculator interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. A toggle in the bottom left corner allows switching between three modes:
*   **Basic Calculator** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>
*   **Scientific Calculator** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>
*   **Math Notes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>

## Math Notes Features
Math Notes transforms the Calculator app into a notes-like interface where users can handwrite mathematical equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
*   **Automatic Equation Solving**: Users can write an equation, and if an equal sign is included, the app automatically solves it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. The solution remains updated as the user continues writing or typing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Advanced Capabilities**: Math Notes supports variables and graphs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Cross-Device Syncing**: Math Notes syncs across devices, allowing users to access and edit their notes on both iPhone and iPad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. The calculator essentially gains a dedicated notes section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **Variable Redefinition**: If a variable is redefined later in the same note, the app intelligently applies the new value from that point onward, while retaining the old value for previous calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
*   **Handwriting Integration**: The app recognizes handwriting and can even write answers in the user's own handwriting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. It also straightens up the handwriting for readability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
*   **Searchability**: All content within Math Notes is searchable and indexable across the Math Notes app itself and the entire phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

While these features are more intuitive with a larger screen and an Apple Pencil, their implementation on the iPhone is considered very impressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

The [[Samsung Galaxy Fold design changes | Samsung Galaxy Fold]] received updates and fixes following initial reports of units breaking. The updated model is now shipping, addressing several issues found in the original review units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Key Design and Durability Changes

The changes in the updated [[Samsung Galaxy Fold design changes | Galaxy Fold]] are subtle but significant for durability:

*   **Extended Protective Layer** The thin layer on the display, which is an integral part of the screen and was mistaken for a removable screen protector by some users, has been extended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. It now reaches all the way to the edges and is tucked underneath the display bezel, up to the corners and sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This prevents users from attempting to peel it off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Hinge Caps** T-shaped caps have been added at the top and bottom of the display, right at the hinge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. These caps are designed to prevent dust or debris from entering the hinge mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. The original [[Samsung Galaxy Fold features and design | Galaxy Fold]] lacked these, leading to notable gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. While this adds protection, the device is not liquid or water resistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Reduced Hinge Gap** When the phone is closed, the gap the hinge creates is now slightly smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. A crack can still be seen through the middle, but barely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Firmer Hinge Mechanism** The hinge mechanism itself is described as being a little more firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. It now has a more firm "snap" when placing it flat and unsnapping it from a flat position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **New On-Screen Warning** During the setup process, a new warning is displayed on the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This warning advises users to avoid pressing the screen hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, as pressing fingernails into the plastic, scratching the protective layer, or pressing too hard can still damage the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The screen material remains a soft plastic due to its folding nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## Consistent Core Features

Despite the fixes, the updated [[Samsung Galaxy Fold design changes | Galaxy Fold]] retains the core features and design of the original:

*   **Form Factor** It remains a "wild phone" that is a thin-screened mini-phone when closed and a seven-inch square mini-tablet when open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Wireless Charging** The device still supports wireless charging and reverse wireless charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Camera System** It features six cameras: three high-end cameras on the back, two on the inside, and one on the front cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **User Experience** The phone remains fun and offers a unique experience for gaming, web browsing, email, and multitasking on its large, foldable display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Crease** The crease on the display appears to be about the same as in the original version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Samsung's Response

[[Samsungs response to Galaxy Fold issues | Samsung]] recalled all review units, including the reviewer's, after they started [[Common issues and fixes in the Galaxy Fold | breaking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. They accepted the issues, took the devices back, and fixed them internally before shipping to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This proactive approach is highlighted as a positive move, indicating Samsung's belief in the foldable phone form factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a> and their willingness to take risks in product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. The issues were attributed to faults in the highly engineered hinge and real-world user behavior not anticipated in lab testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

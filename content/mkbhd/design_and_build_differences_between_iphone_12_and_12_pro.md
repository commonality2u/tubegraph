The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro share a new industrial design, departing from previous models. However, notable differences exist in their materials and weight.

## General Design and Build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>

Both the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro feature an updated industrial design that is described as feeling "great" and "really solid" in hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This new design takes inspiration from the [[Comparison of iPhone 11 Pro to previous models | iPad Pro]] and earlier iPhone models like the iPhone 4 and iPhone 5, characterized by its "boxy sides" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

Key shared design elements include:
*   Antenna lines near the corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   Super tight tolerances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   A flat screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   A "pretty minimal" camera bump, though not entirely flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   The square sides enhance grip, although some users might initially find them "a little bit sharp" or "less comfortable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   The phones can stand up on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   Both models feature a cutout for the 5G antennas on the right side, beneath the power button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>, as all new iPhones support 5G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   The iPhone 12 now includes the "much better looking" OLED display, which essentially matches the quality seen on the Pro phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

Despite these similarities, the specific materials used differentiate the two models significantly.

## Material and Finish Differences

The primary distinctions in build between the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro lie in the materials chosen for their frames and backs:

*   **iPhone 12 Pro:** Features glossy stainless steel sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a> and a satin finish on the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **iPhone 12:** Features more matte aluminum sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a> and a glossy back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

Many prefer the aluminum sides of the [[iPhone 12 design changes | iPhone 12]] over the stainless steel of the [[iPhone 12 Pro features | iPhone 12 Pro]] because the stainless steel tends to show fingerprints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Conversely, the satin back of the Pro models is preferred over the glossy back of the standard iPhone 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## Weight Comparison

While the phones are the exact same physical size, allowing cases to fit both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, their materials result in a noticeable weight difference:
*   **iPhone 12 Pro:** Weighs 192 grams, attributed to its stainless steel construction and extra camera components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **iPhone 12:** Weighs 162 grams, making it lighter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## Color Observations

The Product Red variant of the iPhone 12 is noted for appearing less red than expected, often looking more like "peach," "red orange," or "coral" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Apple is known for changing its colors, so consistency across generations is not guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

The iPhone 6s introduced significant new features, notably the pressure-sensitive display technology called 3D Touch, and a new camera feature known as Live Photos.

## 3D Touch

The iPhone 6s display includes new hardware that makes it pressure-sensitive, a feature Apple calls 3D Touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. This is considered the iPhone's biggest new feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. It's named 3D Touch (not Force Touch) because it offers multiple layers of pressure sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:02">[04:02:02]</a>.

This technology enables what Apple refers to as "Peek and Pop":
*   In a supported app, pressing into an item with a bit of pressure allows you to "peek" to see what it is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.
*   If you like what you see, pressing even harder will "pop" into the item, viewing it full screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.
*   It's distinct from a long press, allowing you to peek and then release to minimize if you don't want to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.

3D Touch also functions on the home screen, where pressing an app icon can reveal quick shortcuts to functions within that app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:55">[04:34:55]</a>. Many Apple apps and some third-party apps support this functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. With practice, users can quickly access specific functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

While 3D Touch is in its early stages and may currently seem gimmicky, it is expected to become more important in the future as developers integrate its functionality in meaningful ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. When attempting to use 3D Touch on an unsupported app icon, the new haptic engine provides a quick triple buzz, blurring the edges of the icon to indicate no functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. This helps users learn which apps support the feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.

## Live Photos

A new feature introduced with the iPhone 6s [[iphone_camera_capabilities_and_features | camera]] is Live Photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:39">[07:34:39]</a>. By default, Live Photos captures 1.5 seconds before and 1.5 seconds after the shutter button is pressed for every picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.

Users can view these short GIFs with sound by performing a [[new_features_of_iphone_x_including_face_id | 3D Touch]] on the photo they just took, seeing the lead-up and what happened right after the shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>. While sometimes described as a gimmick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>, it can be cool in certain situations, such as capturing an object blowing in the wind or the moments immediately before or after a photo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.

Live Photos are enabled by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a> and consume the space of approximately two photos instead of one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>. Currently, there is no direct way to share Live Photos as dynamic media; they are shared as normal pictures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>. Their primary use cases are setting them as wallpaper or Apple Watch faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>. The feature is largely considered a "big beautiful demo" for [[new_features_of_iphone_x_including_face_id | 3D Touch]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.

An upcoming update aims to prevent capturing unnecessary movements (like picking up or putting down the phone) by using the accelerometer and gyroscope to determine when the phone is held steadily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.

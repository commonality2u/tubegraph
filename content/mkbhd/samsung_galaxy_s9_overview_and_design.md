The [[samsung_galaxy_s10_models_overview | Samsung Galaxy S9]] is described as a "nearly perfect" Samsung phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. For those who appreciate Samsung's software, camera, design, and build quality, the S9 represents the best and most complete version of these elements to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Conversely, if previous Samsung phones, slow Android updates, or the Samsung skin were not appealing, the S9 is unlikely to change that opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Design and Build Quality

The S9 continues many of the design philosophies of its predecessor, the [[samsung_galaxy_s10_models_overview | Galaxy S8]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Display

The [[samsung_galaxy_s10_models_overview | Galaxy S9]] features an Infinity Display, considered "one of the absolute best displays in any smartphone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
It has slightly thinner top and bottom bezels compared to the previous model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, and sensors in the top bezel are better hidden for a more seamless black appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Audio

The earpiece now functions as a second front-facing speaker, providing a stereo sound experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. While not equivalent to two large, dedicated front-facing speakers, it offers louder and clearer audio, preventing a complete loss of sound if the bottom speaker is accidentally blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Connectivity and Durability

Key features carried over from the previous generation include:
*   USB-C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>
*   Wireless charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>
*   Fast charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>
*   Headphone jack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>
*   Water resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>

The phone boasts "great clicky buttons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a> and an "A+ build quality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. However, its glass construction means it is prone to smudges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Fingerprint Reader

The most significant external design change is the relocation of the fingerprint reader to the middle of the phone, rather than next to the camera at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This new placement is significantly better, being slightly raised for easier tactile recognition without looking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Registering a fingerprint is also simplified, requiring only a single slow swipe down the scanner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Additional Sensors

The back of the phone now includes a blood pressure sensor in addition to the existing heart rate monitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. While the heart rate monitor provides quick readings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, utilizing the blood pressure sensor requires specific methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Software and User Experience

While the S9 brings hardware improvements, its software experience remains distinctly Samsung.

### Samsung's UI

The phone retains Samsung's characteristic "colorful look" on top of Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. It offers numerous advanced features and customization options, including edge shortcuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. However, the software can feel as though Samsung is "dumping as many features as possible" onto the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

### Biometric Security

The S9 incorporates iris scanning, a feature from the Note series, which is slower but more secure than standard facial recognition via the front camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. A new Intelligent Scan feature combines face and iris scanning, choosing the best method based on lighting conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### Bixby

The dedicated Bixby button remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Bixby can perform intricate commands and deep settings adjustments that other assistants might not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. However, the Bixby button is often triggered accidentally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, and Bixby's "cards" frequently lack useful information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### Samsung Ecosystem

The S9 still includes duplicate apps out of the box, such as two browsers, two smart assistants, two calendars, and two messaging apps, reflecting Samsung's "half-hearted ecosystem push" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. However, as it is an Android phone, these unwanted elements can be removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Comparisons

### S9 vs. [[samsung_galaxy_s10_models_overview | S9 Plus]]

The [[samsung_galaxy_s10_models_overview | Galaxy S9 Plus]] offers a larger screen (6.2 inches vs. 5.8 inches on the S9) and a bigger battery (3500 mAh vs. 3000 mAh) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. The S9 Plus also includes 6GB of RAM compared to the S9's 4GB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, though this difference is rarely noticeable in daily use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Additionally, the S9 Plus features a second telephoto camera for live focus and optical zoom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Despite these differences, the battery performance for both is considered somewhat mediocre, making the choice between the two less significant than it might appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

### [[samsung_galaxy_s10_models_overview | S9 Plus]] vs. [[samsung_galaxy_note_10_and_note_10_plus_design_and_build | Galaxy Note 8]]

The existence of the [[samsung_galaxy_s10_models_overview | Galaxy S9 Plus]] at its price point diminishes the reasons to purchase a [[samsung_galaxy_note_10_and_note_10_plus_design_and_build | Galaxy Note 8]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Unless the stylus is a crucial feature, the S9 Plus is preferable due to its lower price and similar advantages, including an excellent media experience and stereo speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[samsung_galaxy_s10_models_overview | Galaxy S9]] is an optimal Samsung phone, showcasing the brand's strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. It excels with its "awesome displays," "A+ build quality," stereo speakers, headphone jack, expandable storage, and a very good camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. While it retains some "cons of the Samsung experience" like duplicate apps, slower Android updates, occasional performance hiccups, and Bixby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, its display is considered "the master of one" with no better alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. The S9 is highly recommended for its strong performance across many aspects, especially its hardware suite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

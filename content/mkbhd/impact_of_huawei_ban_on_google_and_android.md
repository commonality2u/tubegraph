[[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]], a massive China-based technology company, has faced significant challenges following a US government executive order that effectively blacklisted it from doing business with US companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This action has profoundly impacted [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]]'s smartphone business, particularly its relationship with Google and its use of Android.

## Background on Huawei and US-China Tensions

[[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]] is a huge company with diverse tech businesses, including networking equipment, computers, and most notably, smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. They are the world's second-largest smartphone vendor by market share, trailing only Samsung and ahead of Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Over recent months, the US and China have been escalating a trade war, coupled with historical security concerns regarding the potential for the Chinese government to spy through US companies buying [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]] networking equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. US government agencies were even banned from purchasing [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]] phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This long-standing climate contributed to [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]]'s shaky status in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## The Executive Order and Google's Compliance

The US government signed an executive order adding [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]] to a blacklist, restricting it from conducting any business with any US company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. As a direct consequence, Google, being a US company, complied with the order by halting all business with [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]] and revoking their license to use Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This was not Google's choice, but a mandated compliance with the executive order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This is particularly devastating for [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]], which was the fastest-growing smartphone manufacturer globally, rapidly approaching the number one spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Impact on Existing and Future Huawei Devices

### Past and Present Devices

For existing [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]] devices, such as the P30 Pro, a 90-day exemption was issued, allowing [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]] to continue sending software and security updates to current phones until August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This exemption also applies to Honor, a sub-brand owned by [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Google also confirmed via their Android account that Google Play services and Google Play Protect will continue to function on existing [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]] devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

However, if the situation remains unchanged, these phones will likely stop receiving software updates, including the latest versions of Android, after the 90-day extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. The software version they have at that point will be their final one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Future Devices – Software Challenges

The core challenge for [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]]'s future phones lies in software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. While the base Android operating system (AOSP) is open source and can be used without a Google license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, this version is not ideal as it lacks crucial Google services like Gmail, YouTube, and, most importantly, the Google Play Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

[[Huaweis Alternative Strategies and Challenges | Huawei]] has reportedly been anticipating such a situation, quietly developing a backup OS that supports Android apps and building their own app store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. However, establishing an alternative OS and app store is an immense challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Without business ties to US companies, [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]] cannot easily negotiate to include popular apps like Netflix, Pandora, Facebook, or Instagram in their app store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Previous attempts by large companies like Amazon to create their own app stores have shown how difficult it is to compete with established platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Future Devices – Hardware Challenges

In addition to software, [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]] also faces hardware supply issues. Last year, [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]] spent $70 billion on hardware components, with $11 billion going to US companies like Qualcomm and Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Many critical components, such as Gorilla Glass, flash storage, and radios, come from US suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

While it would be costly and difficult, [[Huaweis Alternative Strategies and Challenges | Huawei]] could potentially switch all of its US suppliers to non-US alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. [[Huaweis Alternative Strategies and Challenges | Huawei]] is one of the few OEMs that develops its own silicon, like the Kirin 980 chip used in the Mate 20 Pro and P30 Pro, which offers some independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Bloomberg reported that [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]] had already stockpiled a three-month supply of preferred parts in anticipation of the ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

## Broader Implications

### Impact on Other Products

The ban extends beyond smartphones. [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]] has also been making competitive laptops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. However, they cannot continue producing Windows laptops without doing business with Microsoft, Intel, and Nvidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

### Market Competition and Innovation

The loss of [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]] from the market would mean less competition, which could reduce the incentive for other companies to innovate and produce high-quality products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]]'s recent phone advancements have pushed the entire [[impact on the smartphone market | smartphone market]] forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### Implications for Foldable Phones

The ban also has specific [[implications of Galaxy Fold failures for foldable phones | implications for foldable phones]]. Following the [[implications of Galaxy Fold failures for foldable phones | Galaxy Fold]]'s PR issues, the [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]] Mate X was anticipated as an upcoming alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. However, its future is uncertain if it cannot run Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

## Huawei's Resilience and Reputation

[[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]] is a "goliath" company with billions of dollars in resources, suggesting they might be one of the few capable of recovering from such a significant setback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Their ideal scenario would be a reversal of the executive order and a return to normal business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

Even if [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]] manages to recover, the long-term [[future of huawei_devices_and_consumer_perception | damage to its reputation]] and consumer perception could be substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Convincing consumers to buy a thousand-dollar [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]] phone that might lack the Play Store or full Android experience will be a tough sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. A similar situation occurred with ZTE in 2018, which was cut off from US business relationships and never fully recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

The situation remains fluid and is far from over, with the possibility of the ban being reversed in the coming months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. For now, the tech world remains in an "unsatisfying limbo" as the future of [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]] is speculated upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

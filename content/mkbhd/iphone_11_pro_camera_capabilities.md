The [[iPhone 11 Pro cameras | iPhone 11 Pro]] and [[iPhone 11 Pro cameras | iPhone 11 Pro Max]] are Apple's flagship iPhones, which place a significant emphasis on their camera systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Apple has positioned these devices as offering "pro-level photo and video camera" capabilities, aiming to deliver the best camera experience in a smartphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Triple Camera System
The [[iPhone 11 Pro cameras | iPhone 11 Pro]] and [[iPhone 11 Pro cameras | iPhone 11 Pro Max]] feature a triple camera setup on the back, joining the "three camera club" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This system includes:
*   A normal camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>
*   A 2x telephoto camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>
*   A 120-degree ultra-wide camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>

Users can switch between these three cameras within the camera app using either buttons or a slider that smoothly transitions between focal lengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. A key objective for Apple was to match the quality as closely as possible across all three cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Video Capabilities
The [[iPhone 11 Pro cameras | iPhone 11 Pro]] supports 4K 60 frames per second (fps) video recording from all three cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This capability is expected to make the [[iPhone 11 Pro cameras | iPhone 11 Pro]] one of the best phones for video capture in its release year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

## Photography Features
The [[iPhone 11 Pro cameras | iPhone 11 Pro]] offers enhancements through computational photography, high dynamic range, and various image pipeline improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Portrait Mode:** Users can now choose to capture portrait mode photos using either the telephoto lens or the standard primary camera, offering more flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Overall Performance
While the [[iPhone 11 Pro cameras | iPhone 11 Pro]] aims for the best photo quality, it faces strong competition from devices like the Pixel 4 and new Huawei flagship models, making its position as the *absolute best* for photos debatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Camera Settings
> A point of contention for "pro" users is that fundamental camera settings remain buried in the general Settings app, rather than being integrated directly into the camera application for easier access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

The concept of a direct-to-consumer casket industry addresses significant markups found in the traditional funeral industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This model aims to provide caskets directly to customers, bypassing intermediaries like funeral homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Issues with the Traditional Funeral Industry
Traditionally, most companies that manufacture funeral equipment sell their products to funeral homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. These funeral homes then package the products and sell them to the customer, acting as a middleman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This middleman structure results in substantial markups, where a casket might cost between five and ten thousand dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Titan Caskets: A Direct-to-Consumer Example
Titan Caskets is identified as the fastest-growing direct-to-consumer casket company in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The company operates with a "noble cause" by selling directly to consumers, thereby cutting out the middleman and offering more affordable prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

For example, the Titan Orion series casket, which gained unexpected fame after Taylor Swift emerged from it in her "Anti-Hero" music video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, costs $1299 when purchased direct-to-consumer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Following its appearance in the music video, Titan Caskets added a "Swifty" discount code at checkout, offering $50 off the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

The Orion casket itself is described as a "very normal high quality steel casket with a locking mechanism and rubber gaskets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The innovation lies not in the casket's design or [[expensive_technology | technology]], but in the direct sales model that makes it more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The narrator humorously notes it is "pretty comfortable for a casket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

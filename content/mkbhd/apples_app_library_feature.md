With the public release of [[accessibility_features_in_ios_14 | iOS 14]], users gained new capabilities for customizing their iPhone home screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. While home screen customization has been a feature on other phones for over a decade, its introduction to iPhone feels new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. One significant addition enabling this flexibility is the App Library <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Utilizing the App Library for Home Screen Organization

The App Library provides a way to manage and organize applications beyond the traditional home screen pages. A key benefit is the ability to remove unnecessary icons or folders from the main home screen views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

Instead of having numerous pages filled with apps and folders, users can now hide entire home screen pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This is achieved by entering "jiggle mode" (long-pressing an app icon), tapping the dots at the bottom of the screen, and unchecking the pages you wish to hide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This effectively hides apps, reducing clutter on the primary home screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

A distinct advantage of this feature, compared to similar functionalities on some Android launchers, is that the hidden pages are saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This means users can easily bring them back whenever needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. For example, one could have a "weekend home screen page" with specific apps like Yelp or Strava that are only displayed when relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

For those pursuing a minimalist aesthetic, [[accessibility_features_in_ios_14 | iOS 14]] allows for a home screen with no apps at all, displaying only the dock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

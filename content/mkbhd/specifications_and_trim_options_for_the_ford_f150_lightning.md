The Ford F-150 Lightning is presented as a highly significant electric vehicle due to the long-standing popularity of the F-150 series, which has been the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. for the past 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. This electric version aims to be better than its gas counterpart, offering enhanced capabilities and new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>.

## Available Versions and Pricing

The Ford F-150 Lightning is available in two main versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>:

*   **Baseline Version**: This version starts at just under $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>, making it the most affordable electric truck option seen so far when compared to the [[tesla_cybertruck_specifications | CyberTruck]] and Rivian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   **Extended Battery Option**: This version starts at just under $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

Most reservations for the F-150 Lightning are expected to fall within the $50,000 to $55,000 price range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. As of the video's recording, Ford had accumulated approximately 70,000 reservations for the vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>.

## Range and Battery Specifications

The official EPA estimated range for the F-150 Lightning is designed to account for real-world usage:

*   **Baseline Version**: Offers a 230-mile rated range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.
*   **Extended Battery Option**: Provides a 300-mile rated range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

This 300-mile EPA rating for the extended battery version is calculated with 1,000 pounds of cargo in the bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. Without additional weight, the observed range in a studio setting showed 367 miles at approximately 80% battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>. Extrapolating this, the full 100% range without cargo could be around 460 miles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>. While Ford has not officially stated the battery size, it is estimated to be between 140 and 200 kilowatt-hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.

## Performance

The F-150 Lightning boasts impressive performance for a pickup truck:

*   **Acceleration**: It is the fastest truck Ford has ever made, surpassing even the Ford Raptor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>. It can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds, even when carrying 6,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>.
*   **Horsepower**: Depending on the battery version, it produces either 430 horsepower or 563 horsepower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.
*   **Torque**: Both versions deliver 775 pound-feet of instant torque <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. This instant torque, available from zero RPM through a wide power band with a one-speed gearbox, offers a significant advantage over gas engines for towing and overall responsiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>.

The F-150 Lightning is a four-door vehicle with a five-and-a-half-foot bed, providing ample space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

*   **Platinum Trim**: This is the highest trim level available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

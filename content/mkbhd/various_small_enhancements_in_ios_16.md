The newest version of iOS, [[ios_15_new_features_overview | iOS 16]], was revealed by Apple about a month prior to this discussion, and is expected to roll out to iPhones (iPhone 8 or later) in the coming months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While the beta version was noted as not yet stable enough for a main device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, it introduces numerous improvements.

## Core Features and Minor Adjustments

### Edit and Unsend Messages
Users can now edit or unsend iMessages for up to 15 minutes after they are initially sent by long-pressing the message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. If a message is edited, the recipient will see that it was modified, but not the edit history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. If a message is unsent, an alert will appear for both parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This feature requires both sender and receiver to be on [[ios_15_new_features_overview | iOS 16]] to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Live Objects
Building upon Live Text, which recognizes text in photos for interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, [[ios_15_new_features_overview | iOS 16]] extends this functionality to videos, allowing users to lift text from paused video frames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
The most significant enhancement is the ability to "lift" any object from a photo by long-pressing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This feature automatically removes the background and performs masking, enabling users to copy and paste the object into other applications like Messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. It works impressively well on various photos, not just those taken in Portrait mode on an iPhone, as long as there's a clear distinction between the subject and background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### General System Improvements
While not a dramatic overhaul, [[ios_15_new_features_overview | iOS 16]] incorporates many small updates that collectively contribute to a notable refresh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

Key "little things" include:
*   **Weather App**: The [[redesigned_stock_apps_and_improvements_in_ios_15 | Weather app]] now displays individual daytime forecasts, showing temperature fluctuations and precipitation throughout the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Safari Video UI**: A cleaner and simpler user interface for watching videos in Safari <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Face ID in Landscape**: Face ID now functions when the iPhone is held in landscape orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Home Screen Search**: The home screen now prominently displays "Search" at the bottom, providing access to a slightly refreshed Spotlight search UI that pops up from the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Apple Card Order Tracking**: Orders made with the Apple Card will now show up directly in the Wallet app, consolidating tracking information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Haptic Keyboard**: The iPhone finally includes haptic feedback for the keyboard, a feature long present on Android devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This uses the iPhone's high-quality vibration motor, providing a "tight and clicky" feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. It is off by default but can be enabled in settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### Continuity Camera
This feature transforms the iPhone into a Mac's webcam, leveraging the superior quality of smartphone cameras compared to typical laptop webcams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. It requires [[ios_15_new_features_overview | iOS 16]] and macOS Ventura <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Quality**: Provides significantly better video quality than built-in webcams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **iPhone Camera Features**: Grants access to iPhone camera features like Portrait mode, Studio Light, and Center Stage during video calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Desk View**: A standout feature using the iPhone's ultrawide camera to simultaneously provide a standard webcam view and a top-down view of the user's desk, ideal for showcasing objects directly in front of the keyboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This involves significant software processing to correct the ultrawide perspective into a flat, overhead view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

### New Lock Screen
The lock screen receives the most prominent visual changes and customization options in [[ios_15_new_features_overview | iOS 16]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Customization**: Users can customize the clock font and color, and add [[new_features_in_ios_17s_messages_and_widgets | widgets]] above and below the clock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Widget Types**: [[new_features_in_ios_17s_messages_and_widgets | Widgets]] below the clock are small, glanceable "watch complications" that open their associated app when tapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. [[new_features_in_ios_17s_messages_and_widgets | Widgets]] above the clock are primarily text-based, suitable for calendar events or weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Multiple Lock Screens**: Users can save multiple customized lock screen layouts and switch between them easily, similar to Apple Watch faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Depth Effect**: If no bottom [[new_features_in_ios_17s_messages_and_widgets | widgets]] are used, the clock can "nestle" between the foreground and background of the wallpaper, creating a depth effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This uses Apple's AI-powered object recognition from the Live Objects feature and works with any photo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **[[focus_modes_and_notification_enhancements_in_ios_15 | Focus Mode]] Integration**: Any custom lock screen can be associated with a [[focus_modes_and_notification_enhancements_in_ios_15 | Focus mode]], allowing for automatic switching of lock and home screens based on activity (e.g., work, sleep) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Notification Display**: Notifications now roll in from the bottom of the screen, preventing them from covering the customized lock screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Users can choose to display notifications as a stack, a list, or a count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Live Activities**: This new feature allows apps to update a single notification live with new information, rather than sending multiple notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Examples include tracking an Uber's approach or live sports scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. The music player and timer also utilize Live Activities, providing a more compact and polished display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

The extensive customization and visual enhancements of the lock screen are highlighted as a major improvement in [[ios_15_new_features_overview | iOS 16]], given how frequently users interact with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

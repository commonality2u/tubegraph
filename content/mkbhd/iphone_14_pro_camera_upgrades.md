The [[iPhone 14 Pro features and innovations | iPhone 14 Pro]] and [[iPhone 14 Pro features and innovations | iPhone 14 Pro Max]] feature a significantly upgraded camera system. It is noticeably larger and protrudes more from the back of the phone compared to previous models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>.

## Main Camera Sensor
For the first time in approximately a decade, the iPhone receives a megapixel bump for its main camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.
The [[iPhone 14 Pro features and innovations | iPhone 14 Pro]] models include a new 48-megapixel main camera sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. While normal shots will still output 12-megapixel images through pixel binning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>, users can expect higher detail and improved low-light sensitivity due to the larger sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. To capture full 48-megapixel photos, users must shoot in ProRaw format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.

## Optical 2x Zoom
A new 2x button has been integrated into the camera user interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. This feature provides an exact crop using the middle 12 megapixels of the sensor, allowing for optical quality zoom, which is a significant improvement over previous digital zoom methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.

## Telephoto Lens
The 3x telephoto lens remains available, offering further optical zoom capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

## Front Camera
The [[iPhone 14 Pro features and innovations | iPhone 14 Pro]] also features a new 12-megapixel selfie camera on the front with autofocus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

## Photonic Engine
Apple has introduced a "Photonic Engine," which is described as a better end-to-end image processing pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. This enhancement is expected to improve overall low-light sensitivity and nighttime photography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

## Action Mode
A new "Action Mode" feature has been added to the camera, providing more dramatic stabilization for super shaky videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. While it appears to work best with certain types of shots as demonstrated, its full capabilities will be evaluated through testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

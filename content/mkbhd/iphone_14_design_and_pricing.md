The [[iphone_14_lineup_overview | iPhone 14]] lineup was unveiled at Apple's September 2022 event, featuring the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus alongside the Pro models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. While the phones maintain a similar appearance to the previous year's models, they include several refinements and new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Design Overview

The new baseline iPhones, the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, are largely similar to their predecessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
They feature:
*   **Displays**: The iPhone 14 has a 6.1-inch display, while the iPhone 14 Plus boasts a larger 6.7-inch display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The displays are the same size and resolution as before but offer increased brightness, reaching 1200 nits max for HDR content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Chip**: Both models retain the A15 Bionic chip, which was also used in the previous year's models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Aesthetics**: The design includes the same notch as before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Cases designed for the [[iphone_13_lineup_and_features | iPhone 13]] are expected to fit the iPhone 14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Colors**: The previous green color option is no longer available, replaced by a new light blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **SIM Card**: In the US, the [[iphone_14_lineup_overview | iPhone 14]] models have entirely removed the physical SIM card tray, moving to electronic SIM (eSIM) exclusively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Satellite Connectivity**: A new feature is satellite connectivity for SOS, allowing users to send emergency messages in areas without cellular service by pointing the phone directly at a satellite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This feature will launch later in 2022 in the US and Canada and will be free for two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Camera System**: Both models feature a larger 12-megapixel main sensor with sensor-shift stabilization and a wider f/1.5 aperture for improved low-light performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The front camera is also a new 12-megapixel selfie camera with autofocus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. The "Photonic Engine" is introduced, which is a better image processing pipeline for enhanced low-light and nighttime photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. A new "Action Mode" provides dramatic stabilization for shaky videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Pricing and Availability

The pricing for the [[iphone_14_lineup_overview | iPhone 14]] lineup remained consistent with previous predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>:
*   **iPhone 14**: Starts at $799 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **iPhone 14 Plus**: Starts at $899 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The iPhone 14 Plus will be available a month later in October <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus are described as being essentially an [[iphone_13_lineup_and_features | iPhone 13 Pro]] from the previous year, but without the telephoto camera and ProMotion OLED display, dressed in aluminum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. The larger iPhone 14 Plus, with its 1080p 60Hz display, is expected to offer the best battery life ever in an iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### Continued Availability of Previous Models
Apple continues to offer the [[iphone_13_lineup_and_features | iPhone 13 mini]] and [[iphone_13_lineup_and_features | iPhone 13]] (baseline model) at reduced prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>:

Accessories like the Anker Nano 3 charger (a compact 30W gallium nitride charger) and the Anker 541 cable (a bio-based USB-C to Lightning cable) are available separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

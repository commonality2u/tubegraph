The Apple Card offers a unique rewards system focused on daily cashback rather than traditional points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. This "Daily Cash" is immediately available and can be spent within 24 hours of being earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Daily Cash Breakdown

The cashback percentages vary depending on how and where the card is used:
*   **1% Daily Cash** is earned on all purchases made with the physical titanium Apple Card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. For example, a purchase made on B&H using the card received 1% cashback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **2% Daily Cash** is earned on all purchases made using [[apple_card_integration_with_iphone_and_wallet_app | Apple Pay]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   **3% Daily Cash** is earned on all purchases made directly from Apple, including the Apple Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

While the card's interest rates are considered "okay" (starting from 12% depending on credit score), it is not expected to appear on "best value cards lists" due to its reward structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

## Integration with Wallet App

The Daily Cash rewards are managed and displayed within the [[apple_card_integration_with_iphone_and_wallet_app | Wallet app]] on the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Transactions populate in the app almost instantly, with a visual color gradient on the digital card within the app changing based on spending categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This visual feature provides real-time feedback on spending and helps to personalize the card experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

Apple's September 2021 event introduced a refresh for the baseline iPad model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This model is considered the best deal in the tablet world and serves as the primary entry point for most first-time iPad users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. It remains the most popular iPad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Design and Display

The exterior of the baseline iPad remains largely unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. It maintains the same 10.2-inch display size and overall design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Key Internal Upgrades

Despite the similar external appearance, the baseline iPad features refreshed internal components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>:

*   **Processor**: It now includes a new A13 Bionic chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Front Camera**: A new 12-megapixel Ultra Wide selfie camera is integrated, featuring [[facetime_updates_in_ios_15 | Center Stage]] functionality, similar to the iPad Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Storage**: The base storage has been updated to 64GB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Operating System**: The device runs on iPadOS 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Connectivity

Unlike other updated iPad models, the baseline iPad still utilizes a Lightning port for connectivity, distinguishing it from newer models that have transitioned to USBC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Pricing and Overall Recommendation

The refreshed baseline iPad retains its "famous" $329 [[pricing_and_value_comparison_with_other_ipads | price]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

Despite being a "pretty minor update" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, the baseline iPad remains the "easiest tablet to recommend" due to its tried and true design and value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This update is less significant than the [[new_ipad_mini_redesign_and_features | new iPad Mini]] redesign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

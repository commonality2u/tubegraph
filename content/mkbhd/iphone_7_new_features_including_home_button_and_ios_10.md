The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus introduced several new features, including a revamped home button and the integration of iOS 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Available in new finishes like matte black and a super glossy jet black, these models offer a fresh look and enhanced user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Both models come with 256 GB of storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Unboxing Experience and Design
The retail box experience for the iPhone 7 is consistent with Apple's packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
For the jet black iPhone, the device comes in a rare black Apple box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Unlike previous models, the phone is not immediately at the top; instead, the "Designed by Apple in California" paperwork is presented first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The jet black iPhone is noted for its glossy finish, which is prone to fingerprints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

The matte black iPhone 7 Plus features a cleaner look and is less prone to showing fingerprints compared to the jet black model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The iPhone 7 Plus notably features dual cameras on the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Despite its advancements, the iPhone 7 still retains significant bezels, including a "big ole forehead" and "big old chin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## In-Box Contents
Upon unboxing, users will find:
*   EarPods with a Lightning connector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   A Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter (dongle), which costs nine dollars if lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   A Lightning cable for connecting to a computer or iTunes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   A wall adapter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## New Capacitive Home Button
A significant change in the iPhone 7 is the introduction of a new capacitive home button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This home button is a piece of glass that does not physically move and is pressure-sensitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. When the phone is off, the button does not move at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

Users can customize the haptic feedback provided by the Taptic Engine when pressing the home button:
*   **Setting 3:** Provides a very firm click response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Setting 2:** The default setting, offering a middle ground response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Setting 1:** A very light feedback, making it almost imperceptible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

The speaker prefers setting 3 to ensure a clear indication of button presses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## iOS 10 and Performance
The iPhone 7 ships with iOS 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. While many features of iOS 10 are similar across devices running the operating system, the iPhone 7 benefits from a new chip, resulting in a faster and smoother experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

The iPhone 7 features the new A10 Fusion chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. The iPhone 7 Plus is confirmed to have 3 gigabytes of RAM, while the iPhone 7 has 2 gigabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Geekbench 4 scores for the A10 Fusion chip show impressive results, particularly in multi-core performance, surpassing Snapdragon 820 devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Color Comparison: Jet Black vs. Matte Black
*   **Jet Black:** This super glossy finish is prone to showing fingerprints and scratches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, making it almost like a "special edition" phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Matte Black:** Offers a super clean look and shows fingerprints less prominently than the jet black variant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

For those undecided between the two new colors, the matte black is suggested as the "safe route" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

The Galaxy S22 series' displays are highlighted as a long-standing strength for Samsung, though there was some initial confusion regarding their specifications at launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39"></a>.

## General Display Features
Both the standard Galaxy S22 and the Galaxy S22 Plus feature flat 1080p, 120Hz adaptive AMOLED panels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42"></a>. Samsung has been noted for its expertise in display technology for a significant period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33"></a>.

## Size and Design
The Galaxy S22 series saw a reduction in overall phone size compared to previous models, impacting the display dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50"></a>.
*   The S22 Plus screen decreased from 6.7 inches to 6.6 inches diagonally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55"></a>.
*   The smaller S22 screen decreased from 6.2 inches to 6.1 inches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01"></a>.

Despite these sizes, the smaller S22 can feel "compact" due to its [[design_and_physical_features_of_galaxy_s22 | flat sides]], tiny symmetrical bezels, and corner-to-corner display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21"></a>.

## Brightness
The displays offer excellent outdoor viewability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58"></a>.
*   The S22 Plus features a higher maximum brightness of 1750 nits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50"></a>.
*   The standard S22 achieves a respectable 1300 nits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55"></a>.
*   The peak brightness on the larger phones and the [[samsung_galaxy_s24_ultra_features | Ultra]] model is exceptionally bright, allowing for viewing even in direct sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04"></a>.

## Refresh Rate and LTPO Technology
A point of confusion upon release was whether these phones utilized LTPO (Low-Temperature Polycrystalline Oxide) displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08"></a>. LTPO technology allows the display refresh rate to modulate down to 10Hz to conserve [[battery_life_and_performance_of_galaxy_s22 | battery life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14"></a>.

Initially, Samsung stated these were not LTPO displays, yet their spec sheets indicated a 10-120Hz range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26"></a>. Samsung later clarified and updated their spec sheets and website to state a refresh rate range of 48-120Hz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36"></a>. This clarification explained that while data transfer rates to the display can go as low as 10Hz, the actual display refresh rate remains faster, reflecting the widely recognized industry standard for refresh rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49"></a>.

Unlike the [[samsung_galaxy_s24_ultra_features | S22 Ultra]], the S22 and S22 Plus do not feature the full variable refresh rate range of LTPO 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07"></a>. This is considered a slight drawback for phones in their price range ($800-$1000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09"></a>.

Despite this, the displays are lauded as great, bright, and responsive in their adaptive mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15"></a>. Some applications, such as mapping apps (Waze, Google Maps) and even the Galaxy store app, still intentionally revert to 60Hz in certain situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28"></a>.

The displays also offer extensive color customization and effective auto-brightness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31"></a>. The only potential drawback associated with the screen is its impact on [[battery_life_and_performance_of_galaxy_s22 | battery life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35"></a>.

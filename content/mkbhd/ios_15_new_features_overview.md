iOS 15 is the software designed for upcoming iPhones, such as the iPhone 12s or iPhone 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Unveiled at WWDC, this update brings significant changes and improvements to the iPhone experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## [[redesigned_stock_apps_and_improvements_in_ios_15 | Redesigned Stock Apps]]

Several built-in Apple applications have received updates, offering a refreshed look and enhanced functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Weather App
The Weather app features a new design with full-screen animations that reflect current conditions, such as sun or rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. It now incorporates information previously found in Dark Sky, an app Apple acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### Clock App
A subtle but welcome change in the Clock app allows users to type the time for alarms instead of relying solely on sliders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Safari
Safari has undergone a significant redesign, relocating the address bar to the bottom of the screen for easier reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This bar moves fluidly, disappearing when scrolling and allowing users to swipe across it to switch between open tabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. When typing, it returns to the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### Apple Maps
Apple Maps continues its relentless improvement efforts, catching up with competitors like Google Maps and introducing unique features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The new version boasts significantly more detail and includes numerous 3D models of buildings and landmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This enhanced detail is more prominent in certain major cities, such as San Francisco and New York City, and is still in development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## [[facetime_updates_in_ios_15 | Facetime Updates]]

Facetime, a widely used communication tool for iPhone users, has received several key enhancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

*   **Spatial Audio:** In group Facetime calls, voices are now oriented to appear from the direction of the speaker on the screen, creating a more immersive experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Grid View:** A new grid view allows users to see all participants clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Portrait Mode:** Users can now blur their background during calls, similar to portrait mode for photos <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Microphone Modes:** New microphone modes offer control over audio input, including standard, voice isolation (to cancel background noise), and wide spectrum (to capture ambient sounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

### SharePlay
SharePlay allows users to share media experiences directly within Facetime calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This feature enables synchronized playback of Apple Music, Apple TV shows, and movies, meaning pausing or fast-forwarding for one person affects everyone in the call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. SharePlay includes an API, allowing third-party apps like Disney, HBO, and ESPN to integrate, with hopes for future support from platforms such as Spotify, Netflix, and YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### Facetime Events
Facetime calls can now be treated as events, allowing them to be added to calendars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. A significant addition is the ability to share a link to a Facetime call, enabling participants on Windows desktops and Android phones to join, effectively bringing Facetime to non-Apple devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Live Text

Live Text is an intelligent on-device feature that recognizes text within images from a user's camera or photo gallery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Users can long-press on recognized text to select, copy, paste, or translate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. This functionality works effectively with both printed and even written text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

Additionally, Live Text can analyze images of animals, attempting to identify their breed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. While similar to Google Lens, Live Text is more intuitive as it's integrated directly into the photo experience without requiring a separate app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This feature requires devices equipped with the A12 Bionic chip or later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

## [[focus_modes_and_notification_enhancements_in_ios_15 | Notifications and Focus Modes]]

iOS 15 brings improvements to notifications and introduces a powerful new feature called Focus Modes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

### Notifications
Notifications feature a fresh design with larger photo and app icons for better visual clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. A new **Notification Summary** feature groups low-priority notifications into one place, making it easier to manage alerts after periods of inactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. When a Focus Mode is active, others messaging you will be informed that your notifications are silenced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### Focus Modes
[[focus_modes_and_notification_enhancements_in_ios_15 | Focus Modes]] are a highly customizable feature that allows users to manage notifications and even home screen layouts based on their current activity or location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. These modes synchronize universally across all Apple devices, including iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, and Mac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

Users can select from default modes like Do Not Disturb, Sleep, Personal, and Work, or create their own custom modes (e.g., Gym, Driving, Reading, Gaming) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Each mode can be configured to allow notifications from specific apps and people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

Furthermore, [[focus_modes_and_notification_enhancements_in_ios_15 | Focus Modes]] can be set to activate automatically based on location or time of day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. A powerful aspect of Focus Modes is the ability to display only certain home screens when a mode is active. For example, a "Work" mode could show only work-related apps, while a "Personal" mode could display social media apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

## Other Notable Enhancements

Beyond the major features, iOS 15 also includes several smaller, yet impactful, improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>:

*   **Improved Spotlight:** Spotlight search now offers more Siri suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Offline Speech-to-Text Recognition:** Enhanced offline speech-to-text recognition provides improved accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   **Performance Tweaks:** Various general performance tweaks and improvements contribute to a smoother user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

Overall, iOS 15 offers a refined and more customizable experience, with significant updates to core applications and new features designed to enhance productivity and focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

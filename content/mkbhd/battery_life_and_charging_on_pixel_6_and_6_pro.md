The [[Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro design and hardware | Pixel 6]] and [[Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro design and hardware | Pixel 6 Pro]] models were expected to have improved battery life due to the new [[Tensor chip performance in Pixel 6 and 6 Pro | Tensor chip]], designed by Google [09:44:46]. This expectation was influenced by the efficiency seen in Apple's silicon, which achieves impressive battery performance [09:51:53]. For instance, the [[Battery enhancements in iPhone 13 Pro | iPhone 13 Pro Max]] can easily achieve 8+ hours of screen-on time with a 4300 mAh battery [09:58:58].

## Battery Capacity and Performance
The [[Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro design and hardware | Pixel 6]] features a 4600 mAh battery [10:10:48], while the [[Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro design and hardware | Pixel 6 Pro]] includes a 5000 mAh battery [10:13:59]. Despite these large capacities and the custom-designed chip, the battery performance was not as exceptional as anticipated [10:17:17].

Users can expect to get approximately 3.5 to 4.5 hours of screen-on time on the [[Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro design and hardware | Pixel 6 Pro]], with slightly less on the [[Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro design and hardware | Pixel 6]] [10:21:21]. This is considered "average at best" and means the phone may run out of battery by the end of a long day [10:31:07]. While this might be forgivable for a $600 phone, it is considered a weakness for a flagship device [10:37:34].

## Charging Capabilities
Neither [[Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro design and hardware | Pixel 6]] nor [[Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro design and hardware | Pixel 6 Pro]] include a charging brick in the box [10:47:04]. The phones support up to 30 watts of wired charging, which is described as "not super fast but okay" [10:50:07]. Wireless charging is even slower [10:55:04]. This means that users may find themselves needing to charge their phones frequently, such as in the car or at a desk [11:05:07].

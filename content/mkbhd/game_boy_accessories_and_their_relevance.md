The Nintendo Game Boy, despite its groundbreaking success, also featured a wide array of official and third-party accessories. While most of these add-ons did not achieve widespread popularity, the Game Boy's dominant market share and dedicated fanbase allowed for the creation of a diverse ecosystem of peripherals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. Marques Brownlee explored some of these noteworthy accessories in a "Dope or Nope" segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

## Notable Accessories

### Handy Boy by STD
The Handy Boy by STD was an accessory designed to enhance the Game Boy's playability, particularly in low-light conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

Key features included:
*   An integrated light to illuminate the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   A flip-down mechanism for a non-magnified view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.
*   Built-in speakers, which were notably loud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

Marques deemed the Handy Boy "dope," concluding that it effectively improved the Game Boy experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

### Pocket Sonar
The Pocket Sonar was a unique accessory that plugged into the back of the Game Boy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>, intended for use in finding fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. However, its practical application was limited, as it required a sufficiently deep body of water to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. Marques rated the Pocket Sonar as "nope" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

### Game Boy Camera and Printer
The Game Boy Camera, at one point, held the Guinness World Record for the smallest digital camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. It allowed users to take photos, view them through the Game Boy screen's viewfinder, and save them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

The Game Boy Printer, which connected to the camera via a cable, could print postage stamp-sized monochrome images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. While the print quality was not high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>, the camera itself was surprisingly functional for its time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.

Marques found the Game Boy Camera to be "dope," praising its functionality, while the Game Boy Printer was categorized as a "nope" due to its execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

The newest version of [[various_small_enhancements_in_ios_16 | iOS 16]], revealed by Apple about a month before its release, introduces several significant improvements for iPhone users. This update is compatible with iPhone 8 models and later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Among the notable features is the long-awaited ability to edit and unsend messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## How to Edit or Unsend a Message

Users can now long-press a message they have sent to access options for editing or unsending it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

*   **Editing**: For up to 15 minutes after sending, a message can be edited to correct typos or change content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The revised message will appear to the recipient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Unsending**: If a user wishes to completely retract a message, they can unsend it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Recipient's View

When a message is edited, the other person will see that it has been edited, but they will not be able to view the edit history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. If a message is unsent, an alert will appear in the chat for both individuals, indicating that a message was removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Compatibility Notice

It is important to note that these features only work if both parties are running [[various_small_enhancements_in_ios_16 | iOS 16]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. If the recipient is not yet on [[various_small_enhancements_in_ios_16 | iOS 16]], they will not see the edits or the undo action, and will still see the original message that was sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

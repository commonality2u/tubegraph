The [[AirPods Max Design and Build Quality | AirPods Max]] are positioned as luxury listening headphones rather than reference-grade studio production headphones, despite some features that might resemble the latter category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. They check a unique set of boxes that no other headphones tested by MKBHD have managed to combine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Design
The design of the [[AirPods Max Design and Build Quality | AirPods Max]] has grown on the reviewer, appearing clean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. There is no Apple logo visible anywhere on the headphones themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Materials and Construction
A significant distinguishing factor of the [[AirPods Max Design and Build Quality | AirPods Max]] is their metal construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Ear Cups**: Made of aluminum, which can feel cold to the touch in winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. They feature a satin finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Headband Frame**: Constructed from stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Tolerances**: The overall build exhibits super tight tolerances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

This metal build sets them apart from virtually all other high-end headphones, which are typically made of plastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The telescoping headband, though lacking notches, is smooth and requires significant pull to adjust, contributing to a high-quality feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. The digital crown and other buttons are also noted for their premium feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

### Weight and Comfort
The primary reason most other headphone companies avoid metal is weight, a crucial factor for long-term comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Metal is significantly heavier than plastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Weight**: The [[AirPods Max Design and Build Quality | AirPods Max]] weigh approximately 380 grams, compared to about 250 grams for typical high-end plastic headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Weight Distribution**: Apple attempts to counteract the weight with a thin, flexible mesh in the top band, designed to evenly distribute the weight on the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **User Experience**: While the weight can be forgotten when sitting still, it becomes noticeable when moving the head, such as nodding or standing up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Comparison**: Compared to the Beats Pros, an older all-metal headphone weighing around 450 grams, the [[AirPods Max Design and Build Quality | AirPods Max]] manage their weight much better, as the Beats Pros were notoriously uncomfortable and pinched the wearer's ears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### Ear Cups and Controls
*   **Over-Ear Design**: Apple opted for an over-ear design, which is preferred by the reviewer over on-ear headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   **Materials**: The ear cups feature mesh with memory foam, described as soft, comfortable, and performing better than leather during long listening sessions (over 2-3 hours) before ears get hot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Removable Ear Cups**: A unique feature for consumer headphones, the ear cups are easily removable via magnets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. This is practical as ear cups should be replaced regularly over the long lifespan of durable headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Apple sells replacements for $69, which is considered overpriced but offers a convenient system for replacement and color mixing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
*   **Digital Crown**: Instead of touch controls (which were a good call to omit), the [[AirPods Max Design and Build Quality | AirPods Max]] feature a larger version of the Apple Watch's digital crown for volume and media controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. It works well with satisfying clicks and can have its spin direction reversed in iOS settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

### Durability and Resistance
The [[AirPods Max Design and Build Quality | AirPods Max]] do not have any sweat or water resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. This means they are not ideal for gym use, or for wearing in rain or snow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Quirks and Drawbacks

### The Smart Case
The included Smart Case is heavily criticized for its design and functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Aesthetics and Design**: The case is disliked for its appearance, sloppy and pointless slots, misaligned lightning port, and being annoying to both take out and put back the headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. The magnet for closing is small and easily missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   **Protection**: It fails to protect the most delicate part of the headphones: the mesh headband <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
*   **Functionality**: The case is required to trigger the low power mode because the headphones lack an off button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. Without the case, the headphones continue to drain battery at the same rate as if they were playing music for about two hours before automatically entering low power mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

The design of the case and the reliance on it for power management are considered a "weird choice" and a typical "Apple-like choice" to lock users into a specific "magical solution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

### Overall Quirks
The [[AirPods Max Design and Build Quality | AirPods Max]] come with a few "gigantic quirks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>:
*   The Smart Case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>
*   The metal build, which makes them heavy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>
*   The price tag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>

The iPhone 12 series marks the first time 5G cellular technology has been included in Apple's smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. While the 5G era had already begun with other smartphone manufacturers, Apple's inclusion of 5G in the [[5g_implementation_in_iphone_12_series | iPhone 12 series]] is seen as a significant accelerant for its wider adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

## Hardware Integration
The iPhone 12 features a [[5g_implementation_in_iphone_12_series | 5G antenna cutout]] on the right-hand side in some regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

## The "5G Just Got Real" Narrative
Apple and cellular carriers have promoted the slogan "5G just got real" with the launch of the iPhone 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>. This narrative emphasizes that with millions of [[5g_implementation_in_iphone_12_series | 5G-capable iPhones]] entering the market, the development and prevalence of 5G networks are expected to accelerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>. Carriers also encourage users to upgrade to their 5G plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.

## Performance and Battery Considerations
In 2020, 5G capabilities present both advantages and disadvantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>.
*   **Speed:** Testing with Verizon 5G (non-millimeter wave/ultra-wideband) showed roughly 20% faster download and upload speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>.
*   **Battery Drain:** 5G radios are power-hungry, leading to increased battery consumption when actively used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>. This power draw is a factor that contributed to the iPhone 12's 60Hz display, as it allowed for battery savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.

## Smart Data Mode Explained
Apple has implemented "Smart Data Mode" to manage 5G usage and optimize battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>.
*   This feature aims to use 5G only when necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>.
*   When in a 4G area, the phone operates at 4G/LTE speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>.
*   In a 5G area, the phone will engage 5G for bandwidth-intensive tasks such as downloading videos, music, or high-definition FaceTime calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>.
*   If in a 5G area but not performing tasks that benefit from 5G speeds, the phone may switch to 4G to save battery, potentially still displaying the 5G indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>.
The philosophy behind this is to make advanced technologies invisible, activating only when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>.

## Implications and User Advice
While 5G is a new feature for the iPhone, it is advised not to purchase the iPhone 12 solely for its 5G capabilities in the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>. However, it serves as a "nice bonus" for users in 5G areas or for future-proofing as networks expand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>. The inclusion of 5G also contributes to the slightly higher price point of the iPhone 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>.

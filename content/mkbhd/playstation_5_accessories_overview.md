Beyond the console itself, the PlayStation 5 (PS5) ecosystem includes a range of accessories designed to enhance the gaming experience, all adhering to a consistent white and black aesthetic with blue accents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. This overview details the official accessories available.

## DualSense Wireless Controller
The [[dualsense_controller_features_and_design | DualSense wireless controller]] is included with the PS5 console and is also available separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.
*   **Design:** Features a "stormtrooper white" color scheme with blue accents, matching the console's aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>. It's larger and feels more solid compared to the PS4 controller, aiming for a more comfortable fit in the hands, similar to the feel of an Xbox Elite controller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. The stems are slightly longer, though the controller remains lightweight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.
*   **Layout:** The button layout remains largely the same, with triangle, square, circle, and X buttons on the right, arrows on the left, a trackpad in the middle, and dual joysticks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.
*   **Power & Charging:** It features a built-in rechargeable 1500 mAh battery, and conveniently charges via USB-C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.
*   **Features:**
    *   Includes haptic feedback and improved triggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. The triggers are noted to be "a little more firm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.
    *   A microphone is located at the bottom, alongside a speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.
    *   The LED light, previously on the back of the controller, is now positioned behind the trackpad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.
    *   Pins are located on either side of the headphone jack, used for docked charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.
*   **Unique Detail:** The coolest part of the controller's design is its subtle texture on the back, made up of tiny, embossed X's, O's, squares, and triangles, which also provides additional grip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.

## DualSense Charging Station
Sony offers a [[dualsense_controller_features_and_functionalities | DualSense charging station]] that can charge two controllers simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.
*   **Functionality:** It uses pins on the charging station that align with those on the controller, allowing the controller to simply pop into place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. Controllers face upright, allowing users to see the charging LED behind the trackpad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>.
*   **Benefits:** This accessory frees up USB ports on the console <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>.
*   **Design Notes:** The charging station comes with a relatively long power cable and a brick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>. While the click-in is satisfying, it's suggested that a heavier base or magnetic charging (like MagSafe) would improve the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.

## Pulse 3D Wireless Headset
The new Pulse 3D wireless headset is designed to integrate seamlessly with the PS5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>.
*   **Audio Features:** It supports 3D audio in compatible games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>. It features dual microphones for enhanced audio quality and noise cancellation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.
*   **Design:** The headset sports a distinct, super minimal white and black design that matches the PS5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. It appears massive and unique but is lightweight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. The material is almost entirely plastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>.
*   **Comfort:** It features a unique dual-band design with a sliding rubber band for fit, and thick, soft, comfortable ear cushions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>.
*   **Connectivity & Power:** It offers USB-C charging and boasts a 12-hour battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. It also includes a 3.5mm headphone jack for direct connection to the controller and a USB dongle for wireless connection to the console or other devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.
*   **Controls:** All controls, including USB-C charging, microphone mute, sliding power, and LED indicator, are conveniently located on the left ear cup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.

## HD Camera
The HD camera is considered likely the least purchased official first-party accessory, but is particularly useful for streamers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>.
*   **Features:** It's a 1080p camera that integrates with the PS5 system and matches its aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>.
*   **Design:** It includes a built-in white stand with an adjustable angle, allowing it to be pointed up if placed below the TV or down if placed above it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>.

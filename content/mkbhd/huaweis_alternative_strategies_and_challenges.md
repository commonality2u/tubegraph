Following the US government's executive order to add [[Huawei and US Trade Restrictions | Huawei]] to a blacklist, restricting it from doing business with any US company, [[Huawei]] faces significant challenges to its operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. This situation has caused a major impact on the tech world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

## Immediate Impact on Existing Devices

Initially, [[Huawei]] was granted a 90-day exemption, allowing it to continue providing software and security updates to existing [[Huawei]] phones until August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. This exemption also applies to Honor, a sub-brand fully owned by [[Huawei]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. Google confirmed that services like Google Play and Google Play Protect would continue to function on existing [[Future of Huawei Devices and Consumer Perception | Huawei devices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.

However, if the ban persists, these phones will likely stop receiving software updates, including the latest Android versions, after the 90-day period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. Their current software version will be the one they retain for the remainder of their lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

## Addressing Hardware Challenges

[[Huawei]] spent $70 billion on hardware components in the previous year, with $11 billion going to [[Huaweis Business Relationships with US Companies | US companies]] like Qualcomm and Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. Many components crucial for smartphones, such as Gorilla Glass, flash storage, and radios, are sourced from the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

Despite this, [[Huawei]] is one of the few OEMs that doesn't rely on Qualcomm for its silicon, as they produce their own Kirin 980 chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. In theory, with substantial effort and cost, [[Huawei]] could switch all its suppliers from [[Huaweis Business Relationships with US Companies | US companies]] to non-US alternatives to continue manufacturing physical phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. Furthermore, [[Huawei]] had built a three-month stockpile of parts in anticipation of the ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

## Addressing Software Challenges

The primary challenge lies in software, as [[Huawei]] can no longer use its Android license, the Google Play Store, or other Google services (e.g., Gmail, YouTube) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. While the base Android Open Source Project (AOSP) is open source and can be used without a license, it lacks Google services and is not ideal for consumer devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.

### Developing Alternatives
Recognizing its reliance on Google, [[Huawei]] has been quietly developing its own backup OS that supports Android apps and building its own app store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

### Immense Hurdles for Software Strategy
Creating an alternative OS and app store presents immense challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. Without the ability to do business with [[Huaweis Business Relationships with US Companies | US companies]], [[Huawei]] cannot easily negotiate to include popular apps like Netflix, Pandora, Facebook, or Instagram in its alternative app store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>. Even large companies like Amazon, despite being multi-billion dollar entities, have failed to create a competitive app store comparable to existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.

## Impact Beyond Smartphones

The ban extends beyond smartphones to other product lines. [[Huawei]] also produces competitive laptops, but these rely on [[Huaweis Business Relationships with US Companies | US companies]] like Microsoft (for Windows), Intel, and Nvidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. Without business ties to these companies, [[Huawei]] cannot continue making Windows laptops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.

The situation also impacts the future of folding phones. With the [[Controversies and challenges faced by iPhone models | Galaxy Fold]] facing its own issues, the [[Huawei]] Mate X was anticipated, but its future is uncertain if it cannot run Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.

## Overall Outlook and Challenges

The loss of [[Huawei]] from the market would reduce competition, potentially leading to less innovation and incentive for other companies to develop new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. While [[Huawei]] is a massive company with billions of dollars to potentially overcome this setback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>, its ideal scenario would be for the US government to reverse the executive order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>.

A significant challenge for [[Future of Huawei Devices and Consumer Perception | Huawei's future]] is its damaged reputation, particularly in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>. Convincing consumers to purchase a [[Future of Huawei Devices and Consumer Perception | Huawei phone]] that might not have the Google Play Store or run Android will be a tough sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>. A similar situation affected ZTE in 2018, leading to a significant decline in its business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. The future of [[Huawei]] remains in an "unsatisfying limbo" as the situation continues to evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>.

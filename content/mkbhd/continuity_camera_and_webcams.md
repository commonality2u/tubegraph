Continuity Camera is a feature introduced in iOS 16 and macOS Ventura that allows an [[iphone_camera_capabilities_and_features | iPhone's camera]] to be used as a webcam for a Mac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:12">[05:14:12]</a>.

## The Problem with Laptop Webcams
While [[camera_improvements_and_capabilities | smartphone cameras]] have significantly improved over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:59">[04:58:59]</a>, [[webcam_relocation_on_the_new_ipad | webcams]] in laptops have not kept pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:45">[05:01:45]</a>. Even modern MacBooks, like the M1 models from 2020, only updated to 1080p [[webcam_relocation_on_the_new_ipad | webcams]] which still look worse than a typical [[iphone_camera_capabilities_and_features | phone camera]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:07">[05:05:07]</a>. Apple's solution was to leverage the superior [[iphone_camera_capabilities_and_features | iPhone cameras]] as external [[webcam_relocation_on_the_new_ipad | webcams]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:58">[05:13:58]</a>.

## How it Works
To use Continuity Camera, an [[iphone_camera_capabilities_and_features | iPhone]] must be running iOS 16 and the Mac must be running the latest version of macOS Ventura <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. Once set up, Continuity Camera wirelessly transforms the [[iphone_camera_capabilities_and_features | iPhone]] into the Mac's [[webcam_relocation_on_the_new_ipad | webcam]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:10">[05:28:10]</a>.

## Benefits and Features
Using the [[iphone_camera_capabilities_and_features | iPhone]] as a [[webcam_relocation_on_the_new_ipad | webcam]] offers significantly better video quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:40">[05:34:40]</a>. It also provides access to advanced [[camera_features_and_performance | iPhone camera features]] during calls, such as:
*   Portrait mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:50">[05:39:50]</a>
*   Studio Light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>
*   Center Stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>

### Desk View
A particularly notable feature is Desk View <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:50">[05:45:50]</a>. By utilizing the [[iphone_camera_capabilities_and_features | iPhone's Ultra Wide camera]] when the device is mounted above a laptop or monitor, users can simultaneously display their standard [[webcam_relocation_on_the_new_ipad | webcam]] view and a top-down view of whatever is on their desk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. This feature displays content directly in front of the keyboard, such as hands or flat objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.

Desk View relies on substantial software processing to correct the Ultra Wide frame, flipping it and transforming it into a perfect top-down perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. This capability can be highly useful in various scenarios, especially for demonstrating or showing objects that are relatively flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>.

Upon release, the [[AirPods Max Usability and First Impressions | AirPods Max]] arrived in a "pretty big box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, showcasing the chosen color, such as minty green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Inside the Box
When the top of the box is opened, the headphones are immediately visible inside their [[AirPods Max Features and Smart Capabilities | Smart Case]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The headphones are shipped in this case, using the band as a handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Beyond the headphones and case, the box contains a small amount of paperwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Included Accessories
The package includes one cable: a USB Type-C to Lightning cable, which is purely for charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Excluded Accessories
Notably, the [[AirPods Max Packaging and Accessories | AirPods Max]] package does not include any Apple stickers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Additionally, there is no power brick included for charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, and an audio cable is not included, requiring an additional $35 purchase from apple.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## The Smart Case
The included [[AirPods Max Features and Smart Capabilities | Smart Case]] is described as "super strange" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a> and resembles a purse or a bra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. The headphones simply slot in and close with a magnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. The case does not allow the headphones to fold down or become more compact for travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. A notable design choice is that the most durable part of the headphone is covered by the case, while the softest, least durable part (the carrying strap) is exposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. The case also features slots, though it's unclear if they are purely for aesthetic purposes or utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. While the case allows for charging via Lightning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, its primary function is to put the headphones into an ultra-low power state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This is critical because the [[AirPods Max Features and Smart Capabilities | AirPods Max]] lack a physical on/off button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>; placing them in the case and closing the magnet detects their presence, triggering the power-saving mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. If the case is not used, the headphones will continue to drain battery for about two hours before entering an auto low power mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

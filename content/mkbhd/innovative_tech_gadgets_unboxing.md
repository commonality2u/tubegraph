This article details a month-long experiment where the creator said "yes" to every product pitch received in their inbox, leading to an unboxing and review of a variety of unusual and innovative tech gadgets. The project aimed to explore products beyond typical [[technology_reviews | technology reviews]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Unconventional Unboxings

### Titan Orion Series Casket
Among the items received was a full-sized casket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Background**: This specific model is notable as it is the same type of casket [[Taylor Swift]] emerged from in her "Anti-Hero" music video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The company, Titan Caskets, aims to disrupt the funeral industry by selling direct-to-consumer, cutting out middlemen who significantly mark up prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Features**: The Orion casket costs $1299 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, significantly less than typical $5,000-$10,000 caskets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. It's a high-quality steel casket with a locking mechanism and rubber gaskets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. A promotional code "Swifty" offers an additional $50 off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Impression**: While not "high-tech," its innovation lies in its direct-to-consumer sales model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. It was surprisingly comfortable for a casket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### Conquest VR Headset Audio Solution
This product, priced at $200 (or $179), is designed to clip onto a VR headset to provide high-res audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. It aims to offer a lightweight audio solution, as existing VR setups often require separate earbuds or headsets which can be cumbersome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Rating**: 7 out of 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. While functional, comparable wireless headphones offer better value for the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Ranvoo Personal Climate Control Devices

#### Medara Portable Air Conditioner and Heater
This neck-worn device features internal fans and batteries, allowing users to select a desired temperature for personal heating or cooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. It has a 5800 mAh battery and costs $250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. An accompanying app is required for operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Impression**: It works, providing both cool and warm air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. However, its high cost makes it questionable, as simpler solutions like a scarf could achieve similar results for heating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Rating**: 5 out of 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. It functions, but is not a cost-effective solution.

#### Electronic Hand Warmer
Another product from Ranvoo, this electronic hand warmer features a tiny LCD screen displaying temperature and battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. It has a 4000 mAh battery and costs $80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **Impression**: The logo appears similar to Apple's News logo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Rating**: 5 out of 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

### Case Sexy Customized Memoji Clear Plastic Cases
These customizable clear plastic phone cases allow users to feature their Memoji <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Features**: They include a "Case Sexy" watermark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. While they allow MagSafe charging, they don't provide the full MagSafe animation experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Impression**: The quality might not be the highest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Rating**: 3 out of 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### Portable Car Infotainment System
This 7-inch touchscreen, priced at $250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, is designed to add modern infotainment features to older cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Features**: It can be connected via power and an audio jack, and supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto (though branded as "iPlay" and "Auto") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. It includes a backup camera with an LED light for night vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   **Impression**: It's a solid solution for updating an older car's functionality without buying a new vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. The main challenge is wiring it into the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **Rating**: 8 out of 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

### Realme 10 Pro Coca-Cola Edition
This budget-friendly smartphone is a special collaboration with Coca-Cola <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **Phone Specs**: It features a Snapdragon 695 processor, a 120Hz display, a 5000 mAh battery with 33W charging, and a 108-megapixel camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Coca-Cola Integration**: The branding is extensive, including a unique box, a "Realme Cat" figurine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, a sticker pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, a giant Coca-Cola logo on the phone's back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, Coca-Cola-themed wallpaper and icon packs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, and Coca-Cola bottle sounds for touch feedback and ringtones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   **Impression**: Despite not personally liking Coca-Cola, the creator expressed respect for the thoroughness of the brand collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Rating**: 11 out of 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>, hailed as the "best brand collab in a long time."

### Gravastar Sirius P5 Earbuds
These 80-dollar earbuds are IPX4 rated, offer 40 hours of battery life, and feature electronic noise cancellation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Unique Features**: They come with a remarkably strong spring-loaded case with lights indicating charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. The earbuds themselves are heavy and metallic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. A significant gimmick is the interchangeable outer case design, requiring a screwdriver to swap out the internal earbud tray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Impression**: They did not fit well in the creator's ears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a> and did not sound great <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. The customization aspect is unusual for earbuds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Rating**: 7 out of 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

### License-Free Walkie-Talkie
A functional, multi-channel walkie-talkie with a belt clip and antenna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   **Background**: The company initially offered a higher-power model that required a license, but supplied a lower-power, license-free version instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
*   **Utility**: Proved useful for car shoots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Its primary function is communication over a specified range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
*   **Impression**: It works, fulfilling its basic purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

### Portable Multi-Screen Laptop Setup
This setup allows a laptop to become the middle screen of a three-screen portable workstation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   **Design**: The contraption consists of plastic and hinges with a 16-inch display on each side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. It adjusts to fit around various laptop screens, connecting via multiple cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.
*   **Display Specs**: Each display is 16 inches with a 144Hz refresh rate, 2560x1800 resolution, LED IPS panels, and an anti-glare surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.
*   **Compatibility**: Currently works with macOS, with Windows compatibility planned for Q1 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.
*   **Impression**: It's described as "kind of incredible" and "kind of cool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.
*   **Rating**: 9 out of 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

## Learnings from the "Yes" Challenge
The experiment provided insights into the dynamics between product companies and content creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.
*   **Product Allotment**: Smaller companies often have limited products available for reviews, leading them to seek guarantees of video content from creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
*   **Contracts**: Some companies may request creators to sign contracts promising to produce a video if they receive a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.
*   **Creator Advice**: Creators are advised not to sign such contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>, as it restricts their creative freedom and integrity. The ability to decline most requests (99% in this case) is a positive position for a creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

The AirPods Max, Apple's high-end wireless noise-canceling headphones, excel in their noise cancellation and transparency mode capabilities, which are considered among the best available in consumer headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.

## Noise Cancellation
The noise cancellation in the AirPods Max is described as "excellent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>. It leverages nine microphones to effectively cancel out white noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. A notable aspect of this feature is its "surprisingly natural sound," avoiding the common "pressure" sensation often associated with noise-canceling headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.

The effectiveness of the [[noise_cancellation_in_airpods_pro | noise cancellation in AirPods Pro]] was demonstrated by its ability to cancel out a vacuum cleaner three feet away from the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. The AirPods Max's noise cancellation is considered on par with the Sony XM4s, which are regarded as "kings of noise cancellation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>. This capability makes them suitable for environments like airplanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.

## Transparency Mode
The AirPods Max features the "best transparency mode" ever heard by the reviewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. This mode allows ambient sound to pass through the headphones, enabling users to hear their environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. Unlike other headphones' ambient modes, the AirPods Max's transparency mode provides an incredibly clear and spatial awareness of sounds, allowing the user to discern not just what is being said, but also the direction from which sounds are coming (e.g., right, left, front, or back) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. This advanced capability contributes to an overall "fun to listen to" experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>.

Both the noise cancellation and transparency mode features contribute significantly to the overall [[sound_quality_and_performance | sound quality and performance]] and "luxury listening" experience of the AirPods Max <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. These features, along with [[improved_noise_cancellation_and_transparency_mode | improved noise cancellation and transparency mode]], are central to the headphones' appeal for consumer-oriented use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

The iPhone XR entered the market with an existing reputation, positioned as a more affordable option compared to the iPhone XS. While sharing many new parts and design elements with the iPhone XS, the iPhone XR features several key differences that contribute to its lower price point, being about $250 cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The iPhone XR starts at $750 for 64 gigs, while the iPhone 8 started at $700, making the XR a compelling upgrade for users of older models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

## Design and Build
The iPhone XR and iPhone XS share a similar overall design, but the XR utilizes different materials in its construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

*   **Materials**: The iPhone XR uses anodized aluminum for its sides, unlike the stainless steel found on the iPhone XS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This allows for color-matching with the glass backs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The aluminum is noted as being more slippery than stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Colors**: The iPhone XR is available in six new colors, with vibrant, saturated glass backs. The rail colors are less saturated than the glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Red and blue are highlighted as particularly appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Water Resistance**: The iPhone XR has an IP67 water resistance rating, a slight downgrade from the iPhone XS's IP68 rating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Antenna Bands**: The iPhone XR features slightly different locations for its antenna bands and is missing a couple of visible bands found on the iPhone XS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Gigabit LTE**: Due to the missing bands, the iPhone XR does not support Gigabit LTE, which the iPhone XS does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This difference impacts a small number of users whose carriers support the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Display
The display is the most significant difference between the iPhone XR and iPhone XS, contributing significantly to the cost reduction of the XR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

*   **Type**: The iPhone XR uses what Apple calls a "Liquid Retina Display," which is an LCD panel with curved corners, in contrast to the OLED display on the iPhone XS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. While considered one of the best LCDs, it cannot achieve the pitch blacks and contrast of an OLED <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Size**: The iPhone XR features a 6.1-inch display, positioning it between the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max in terms of size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Its size can make reaching corners and tops of the display challenging for some users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Resolution and Pixel Density**: The iPhone XR's display is 1792x828 pixels with a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch (PPI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. While this is less than 1080p, and comparable to older models like the iPhone 4 or iPhone 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, it is still considered crisp enough for regular use, with good color and brightness, and decent viewing angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Pixel peeping up close reveals it to be less sharp than the iPhone XS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Bezels**: The iPhone XR has slightly thicker bezels (a couple of millimeters) compared to the iPhone XS, which are noticeable daily, though users tend to adapt to them over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **3D Touch**: The iPhone XR lacks 3D Touch, a feature present on the iPhone XS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. While long presses can replicate some functionality in Control Center and on the lock screen, actions like "peek and pop" into links are largely gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Other Features**: The iPhone XR retains "tap to wake" and True Tone display features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Performance and Battery
These aspects are partially influenced by the display choice.

*   **RAM**: The iPhone XR has 3GB of RAM, one gigabyte less than the iPhone XS's 4GB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. However, this is sufficient for iOS due to less pixel pushing and efficient RAM management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Battery**: The iPhone XR features a 2942 mAh battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Its battery life is excellent, comparable to or sometimes better than the iPhone XS Max, largely thanks to the efficient A12 Bionic chip pushing fewer pixels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

## Camera
The camera setup is a significant point of differentiation.

*   **Rear Camera**: The iPhone XR has a single rear camera, which is the exact same primary camera found on the iPhone XS, but lacks the secondary telephoto lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Image quality from the iPhone XR's camera is considered very good, on par with the iPhone XS's primary camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Optical Zoom**: The absence of the telephoto lens means the iPhone XR does not have optical zoom; it relies on digital zoom, which results in worse quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. However, in low light, the iPhone XS often defaults to digital zoom from its primary lens anyway because the telephoto lens lets in less light, making the practical impact of this difference less significant than perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **Portrait Mode**:
    *   The iPhone XS uses both cameras for depth detection and the telephoto lens for a natural bokeh effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
    *   The iPhone XR's portrait mode relies entirely on software for depth detection and uses the primary wide-angle camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. This results in wider-angle portraits with a shallow depth of field, which some prefer as a more visually interesting look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
    *   A significant drawback for the iPhone XR's portrait mode is its limitation to only detecting human faces for portrait shots; it cannot be used for objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

## Conclusion
While the iPhone XR is not a "budget phone," its lower price point makes it a more accessible option compared to the iPhone XS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. The display and camera are identified as its main downsides when directly compared to the iPhone XS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. However, for users upgrading from older models like the [[differences_between_iphone_x_and_iphone_8 | iPhone 8]] or iPhone 7, the iPhone XR represents an upgrade in nearly every aspect for a relatively small increase in cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. The iPhone XR is generally recommended as a good upgrade with no significant flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

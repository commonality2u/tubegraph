The Sony Xperia One Mark II is a smartphone featuring flagship specifications and several unique, useful features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Despite its capabilities, Sony has had a roughly zero percent market share in smartphones for several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Core Specifications and Design
The Sony Xperia One Mark II runs on a Snapdragon 865 processor with eight gigabytes of RAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. It has a 4,000 milliamp-hour battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> and an all-glass and aluminum frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The device is water-resistant and supports wireless charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. It operates on Android 10 with Sony's overlay, which is noted for being close to stock Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

Additional hardware features include:
*   A high-quality haptic motor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   A fingerprint reader integrated into the power button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   Thin bezels with no hole punch or notch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
*   A clean, minimal, modern form factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>

## [[display_quality_of_sony_smartphones | Display]]
The Xperia One Mark II features a 21x9 aspect ratio widescreen display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This aspect ratio makes the phone narrower and more comfortable to hold, improving reachability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The thin bezels allow for front-facing speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

A standout feature is its 6.5-inch 4K screen, making it one of the few smartphones with such a high resolution display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Users can enable "creator mode" in display settings for the most accurate colors and best-looking videos and photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. However, it is a 4K 60Hz display, which some users might not perceive as significantly different from lower-resolution screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

## Hardware Features

### Expandable Storage
The phone includes tool-less microSD and SIM card tray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This design allows for quick swapping of cards while maintaining water resistance, which is particularly useful for users who take many photos and videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### Headphone Jack
The Xperia One Mark II retains a headphone jack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, even though Sony sells its own line of wireless earbuds and headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Some bundles of the phone include Sony's high-end Mark IV headphones for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Software Features

### Android Overlay and Multitasking
The phone runs Android 10 with a clean, near-stock Sony overlay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. It has a Google Explorer page on the side and a quick Google search box at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Pre-installed apps are minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

The always-on display shows icons for recent apps that pulse to indicate new notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. The tall display supports easy and smooth multitasking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Pressing the middle button brings up a multitasker for both panels, allowing users to switch apps, launch app groups (two at a time), or quit entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

### Dynamic Vibration System
The phone's speakers have a unique feature where the chassis vibrates to act as extra bass, physically buzzing in the hand with lower frequencies in songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This feature can be toggled on or off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### Other Software/Hardware Integrations
*   An LED notification light is present on top, which is rare in modern phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   An extra customizable button at the bottom can launch apps or serve as a camera shutter button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

## [[camera_performance_and_features | Camera System]]

The Xperia One Mark II features triple 12-megapixel cameras, including a primary, telephoto, and ultra-wide lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Photos taken in automatic mode offer good dynamic range, neutral colors, and fast focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

Sony leverages its expertise from its Alpha line of mirrorless cameras, such as the A7 III <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, integrating [[camera_technology_in_sony_phones | camera technology]] like incredible autofocus and extensive manual controls into the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### Professional Camera Applications
The phone includes "Photo Pro" and "Cinema Pro" apps for advanced users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

*   **Photo Pro**: This app shrinks the viewfinder and offers full camera modes and manual control levels similar to a Sony Alpha camera, including object and eye tracking, histograms, exposure compensation, and metering modes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. It has a learning curve due to its touchscreen interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Cinema Pro**: This app provides wide dynamic range 4K video with adjustable manual controls, ISO control, Venice Color Science, manual focus, and focus racking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Focus racking allows setting two focus points (A and B) and smoothly racking between them without hunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

Despite these advanced features, the phone lacks a simple night mode for quick low-light photos, which popular phones like the Pixel offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. The front-facing camera records only 1080p at 30 frames per second, which may be a drawback for users who prioritize selfie camera performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## Market Performance and Challenges
Sony's smartphone sales have seen a significant decline, falling from nearly 40 million units per year to just 6.5 million in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. For perspective, Apple can sell that many iPhones in a week during a strong quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Sales further decreased to less than 3 million in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Niche Appeal
> One reason for low sales is that the phone's enthusiast-level features appeal to a very small percentage of the overall smartphone market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. While enthusiast features can sometimes drive sales, mass appeal requires catering to a broader audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Many users who would benefit most from the advanced manual camera controls already own dedicated mirrorless cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Poor Launch Strategy
> A significant factor contributing to low sales is Sony's inability to properly launch phones to the masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. The Xperia One Mark II was unveiled in May but only became available much later, leading to a loss of hype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. This long delay between announcement and release makes the company appear not to prioritize its phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. The successor, the Xperia 5 Mark II (a smaller version with a 120Hz display and lower price), was announced before the Mark II was widely available, with its own availability delayed until December <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This poor launch strategy discourages both consumers and reviewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

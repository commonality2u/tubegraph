With the release of iOS 18 in mid-2024, a significant overhaul of the Control Center has been introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This update brings new customization options and an updated visual design, though not all changes may appeal to every user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Design and Navigation
The new Control Center is more colorful and is now paginated, spreading across three distinct pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

*   **First Page**: This page displays the primary controls, which can be extensively customized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Second Page**: Dedicated to media playback, this page features a full-page visualizer for whatever media is currently playing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Third Page**: This page presents a comprehensive list of one-touch toggles for basic connectivity settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This full-page list is essentially an expanded version of the connectivity controls found on the first page, accessible with a few extra taps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Customization
Users can customize their Control Center layout by tapping the plus button in the corner of the first page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This reveals a grid that allows for adjusting the size and placement of any control that has a tab in its bottom corner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Controls have predefined sizes and can morph between them, enabling users to design their ideal control screen layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

New controls can be added from a vast list, making it easier to surface frequently used functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Currently, most of these controls are for Apple apps, but Apple has confirmed that third-party apps will eventually be able to integrate their own controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. These are designed as direct controls (e.g., turning on Wi-Fi, adjusting brightness), not [[Widgets on iOS 14 | widgets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. The anticipation is for third-party controls like a one-touch AC activation in a car or a barcode scanner in a calorie tracker app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### New Controls and Features

*   **Flashlight Control**: A new flashlight control allows users to adjust both the intensity and beam width of the torch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. While intensity adjustment clearly works, the beam width functionality is less convincing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Power Off Button**: A new button has been added to the Control Center to turn off the iPhone, similar to a feature found on Android devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Lock Screen Control Customization**: Users can now finally change the default controls (flashlight and camera) on their lock screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. By holding down on the lock screen, selecting "Customize," and then "Lock Screen," a wide array of options becomes available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. The hope is for third-party app integration here as well, allowing for quick access to apps like a to-do list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Initial Reception of Samsung Galaxy Fold Failures

The early rollout of the Samsung Galaxy Fold was met with significant public attention, particularly after several review units broke in the hands of reviewers around the same time [00:00:25]. This information quickly spread across platforms like Twitter [00:00:18].

A primary cause of these early failures was the accidental removal of what appeared to be a screen protector [00:00:46]. Reviewers, accustomed to peeling off pre-installed plastic films from new phones like the Samsung Galaxy S10 [00:01:05], did the same with the Galaxy Fold [00:01:26]. However, this "film" was actually an integral [[folding_screen_technology | protective layer]] of the display structure [00:06:21]. Removing it caused immediate and significant damage to the screen [00:01:49], [00:03:55].

### Lack of Clear Warning
Review units of the [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Galaxy Fold]] did not include a warning on the packaging about the protective layer being non-removable [00:04:52], [00:05:07]. It appears that a warning, stating "The main screen includes a special protective layer. Peeling that protective layer or using any adhesives on the main screen such as a screen protector or stickers may cause damage," was a later addition for carrier stores [00:04:53], [00:05:22].

## Impact on Broader Foldable Phone Perception

The incidents with the Galaxy Fold had a "brutal" public relations effect, not only for Samsung but for [[implications_of_galaxy_fold_failures_for_foldable_phones | folding phones in general]] [00:06:48]. Even other anticipated models, like the Huawei Mate X, which features an external folding display, became subject to increased skepticism regarding their durability in the hands of normal users [00:06:53], [00:06:59]. This initial setback has regrettably cast a shadow on how people perceive these nascent devices [00:07:05].

## Optimism for the Future of Foldable Technology

Despite the initial hurdles, there remains significant optimism for the future of [[speculation_on_future_foldable_phones | folding phones]] among tech enthusiasts [00:07:19]. There is a desire to see these innovative concepts succeed and gain traction, leading to the development of second and third generations that are improved [00:07:24], [00:07:28].

Samsung's extensive eight-year development period for the [[samsung_galaxy_fold_design_changes | Galaxy Fold]] highlights the complexity and long-term commitment required for such a new form factor [00:07:45]. The first generation is viewed by some as akin to a "public beta test," providing crucial feedback for future iterations [00:08:18].

### Inherent Challenges and Hurdles
The fundamental nature of [[folding_screen_technology | folding phone displays]] requires a plastic, rather than glass, material, which is inherently softer and more prone to damage [00:06:37], [00:06:42]. Furthermore, the durability tests performed by robots (e.g., 200,000 folds) do not fully account for real-world "user error" [00:08:37], [00:08:43]. The presence of moving parts, such as the [[folding_phone_hinge_and_durability | hinge]], and the current lack of water resistance, introduce new considerations for users [00:08:44], [00:08:46]. These factors represent significant hurdles that [[speculation_on_future_foldable_phones | folding phones]] must overcome to achieve widespread adoption and become robust devices [00:08:53].

Ultimately, there is a strong belief that [[speculation_on_future_foldable_phones | folding phones]] will eventually "get good" and offer a compelling user experience [00:09:06], [00:09:11].

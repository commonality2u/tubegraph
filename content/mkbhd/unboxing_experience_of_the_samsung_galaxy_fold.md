The retail unboxing of the [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Samsung Galaxy Fold]] presents a unique experience, given its positioning as a luxury device and its price point of $1,980 [00:00:23]. Samsung made significant efforts to ensure buyers felt their money was well spent [00:00:46].

## Packaging Presentation

The [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Galaxy Fold]] comes in an "awesome" and "super extra" box-within-a-box presentation [00:00:54]. The phone itself is contained in a thin box located on the top [00:00:59].

The unboxing reveals several valuable accessories:
*   A two-piece Kevlar case [00:01:06]
*   A SIM card ejector tool [00:01:09]
*   A pair of Samsung [[included_accessories_with_the_samsung_galaxy_fold | Galaxy Buds]] in an AKG sleeve [00:01:13] [00:01:15]. These are described as $139 wireless earbuds, comparable to AirPods in the Samsung/Android ecosystem, and are a significant inclusion given the [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Galaxy Fold]] lacks a headphone jack [00:01:18] [00:01:21] [00:01:24] [00:01:27].
*   A fast charger [00:01:34]
*   A USB-C to full-size USB dongle [00:01:36]
*   Additional rubber tips for the [[included_accessories_with_the_samsung_galaxy_fold | Galaxy Buds]] [00:01:41]
*   A USB-C to USB-A cable [00:01:43]

## The Phone's Presentation

The [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Galaxy Fold]] itself is found folded flat within its thin white box [00:01:58]. The reason for shipping it in a folded-flat state is not specified but could be to avoid a crease from the factory or for a more dramatic reveal [00:02:04]. The demonstrated model is black [00:02:13].

## Initial Setup Process

The setup process for the [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Galaxy Fold]] is described as nearly identical to other Samsung phones like the [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Galaxy S10]] [00:02:24] [00:02:26]. Users sign into their Google and Samsung accounts [00:02:29] [00:02:30]. This can be done on either the front screen or the larger inside screen, with the latter being preferred for its larger keyboard [00:02:34] [00:02:38]. The device ultimately settles on a default black butterfly wallpaper with pitch black pixels around the edges [00:02:46] [00:02:48].

## The Included Case

The [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Galaxy Fold]] comes with a two-piece Kevlar case made of a flexible material [00:03:03] [00:03:05]. Any case for the [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Galaxy Fold]] would need to be foldable or come in two pieces due to its design [00:02:57] [00:03:02]. This case avoids covering the hinge and has no moving parts [00:03:08]. It features internal adhesive for attachment, though it can also be used without the adhesive [00:03:10] [00:03:15]. While providing protection, the case does make the phone appear "a little uglier" [00:03:21].

## Magnetic Clasp Strength

A notable feature is the strong magnets that hold the [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Galaxy Fold]] closed [00:03:30] [00:03:48]. There is a magnet on each side of the device, located about two-thirds of the way down [00:03:53] [00:03:55]. These magnets are powerful enough to create a magnetic field outside the phone and can pick up various metal objects, including washers, nails, keychains, small wrenches, and even an Apple Pencil or a large Allen key [00:04:03] [00:04:06] [00:04:08] [00:04:11] [00:04:16] [00:04:21] [00:04:24] [00:04:27] [00:04:31].

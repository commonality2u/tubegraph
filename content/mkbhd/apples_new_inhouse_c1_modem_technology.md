## Introduction of the C1 Modem
The [[iphone_16e_features_and_specifications | iPhone 16e]] introduces Apple's first in-house-designed cellular modem, known as C1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Rumors about this development had circulated for years, stemming from Apple's acquisition of part of Intel's modem business for a billion dollars six years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. This marks the first [[iphone_16e_features_and_specifications | iPhone]] that no longer uses a Qualcomm modem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>, with Apple replacing it for 4G, [[5g_implementation_in_iphone_12_series | 5G]], GPS, and satellite connectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Apple has experienced success with vertical integration, as seen with [[significant_technological_advancements_in_iphones | Apple silicon]] replacing Intel chips in MacBooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

## Performance and Capabilities
For most users, the C1 modem's performance will likely go unnoticed, which is considered a positive outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Speed tests conducted in various locations showed no dramatic differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Gripping the phone in different ways does not appear to affect signal, as the antennas are not changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

However, the C1 modem in the [[iphone_16e_features_and_specifications | iPhone 16e]] does not yet support millimeter wave [[5g_capabilities_in_iphone_12 | 5G]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

## Efficiency and Battery Life
A significant claimed improvement of the C1 modem is its efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Modems have historically been substantial power draws, especially when a phone is actively searching for or switching between 4G and [[5g_implementation_in_iphone_12_series | 5G]] signals in areas with poor cellular coverage, leading to battery drain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

Previous [[iphone_se_2020_features | iPhone SE]] models, despite having modern processors, often suffered from poor battery life due to their smaller bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. The [[iphone_16e_features_and_specifications | iPhone 16e]], being a modern-sized phone, coupled with the new, more efficient, and physically smaller C1 modem, allows for a physically larger battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. This has resulted in "really good" battery life, reportedly on par with the [[iphone_15_pro_advanced_features | iPhone 16 Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

## Strategic Implications
Apple's decision to debut the C1 modem in the [[iphone_16e_features_and_specifications | iPhone 16e]], a relatively low-stakes and lower-volume phone, suggests a strategy to iron out any potential kinks or issues before its broader deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. It is anticipated that the C1 modem will be fully ready for the [[iphone_15_pro_advanced_features | iPhone 17]] series later in the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

The C1 modem's efficiency and smaller physical size could also be a missing piece in enabling Apple to create a "super thin" iPhone Air, a concept that has been discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Historically, achieving super-thin designs has compromised battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. The C1, possibly alongside silicon carbide battery technology, might allow for an extremely thin [[iphone_16e_features_and_specifications | iPhone]] with satisfactory battery performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

The research and development (R&D) of the new C1 chip is cited as one of the factors contributing to the higher price point of the [[iphone_16e_features_and_specifications | iPhone 16e]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

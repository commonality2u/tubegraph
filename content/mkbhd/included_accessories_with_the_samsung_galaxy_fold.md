The [[unboxing_experience_of_the_samsung_galaxy_fold | retail unboxing]] of the Samsung Galaxy Fold reveals a deliberate effort by Samsung to justify its premium price point of $1,980, positioning it clearly as a luxury device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The presentation of the box itself is described as "super extra," featuring a "box within a box" design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Unboxed Items

Upon opening the primary box, several accessories are found alongside the device itself:

*   **Two-piece Kevlar Case**: Included in a pouch at the top of the box is a two-piece Kevlar case for the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This case is designed to be flexible and comes in two pieces to accommodate the foldable nature of the phone, avoiding the hinge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. It includes adhesive on the inside, though it's noted that the adhesive doesn't necessarily need to be used for the case to stay on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **SIM Card Ejector Tool**: Also found in the pouch with the Kevlar case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Samsung Galaxy Buds**: A pair of Samsung Galaxy Buds, valued at $139, are included in an AKG sleeve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. These wireless earbuds are considered an "AirPods equivalent" in the Android ecosystem and are a significant inclusion, especially since the Galaxy Fold lacks a traditional headphone jack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Fast Charger**: A fast charger is provided in the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **USB-C to Full-Size USB Dongle**: This dongle is included, suggesting a commitment to wireless audio given the absence of other dongles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Additional Rubber Tips for Galaxy Buds**: More rubber tips for the included Galaxy Buds are found in separate boxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **USB-C to USB-A Cable**: A standard charging and data transfer cable is also provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

The phone itself comes in a thin white box, [[samsung_galaxy_fold_design_changes | folded flat]] within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The initial setup process for the phone is similar to other Samsung devices like the Galaxy S10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Notable Design Elements

During the [[unboxing_experience_of_the_samsung_galaxy_fold | unboxing experience]], the strong magnets used to keep the phone closed are highlighted. There is a magnet on each side of the [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Galaxy Fold]], approximately two-thirds of the way down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. These magnets are strong enough to pick up various metal objects, including washers, nails, keychains, small wrenches, Apple Pencils, and even large Allen keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

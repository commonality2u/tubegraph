The hinge and overall durability of folding phones are critical elements, with different manufacturers approaching the challenge in varied ways. Early models, like the Royole FlexPai, highlight some of the initial struggles in balancing innovation with robust design.

## Royole FlexPai Hinge Design
The Royole FlexPai, the first folding phone to ship in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, features a hinge design described as a "hack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. The most vulnerable and important non-screen part, the hinge, is covered in an accordion-shaped rubber and screwed in on the sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Challenges and Concerns
*   **Smoothness and Noise:** The hinge is not smooth to fold and unfold, occasionally making noises when touched incorrectly during folding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Material Durability:** There are doubts about the accordion-shaped rubber material's ability to withstand wear over time, including prolonged folding, sun exposure, scratching, or ripping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Aesthetics:** The rubber on the back, while preventing debris from entering the hinge and potentially impacting the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, makes the phone resemble an accordion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Fold Rating:** Unlike other devices, there is no stated number of folds that this mechanism is rated for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Comparison to [[Samsung Galaxy Fold design changes | Samsung Galaxy Fold]]
In contrast to the [[Samsung Galaxy Fold design changes | Galaxy Fold]], which featured a "highly engineered hinge" and was claimed to withstand 200,000 folds by a robot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, the Royole FlexPai does not give the impression of being more durable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Despite initial issues with the [[Samsung Galaxy Fold design changes | Galaxy Fold]]'s durability upon its first release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, its hinge design was more technically advanced.

## Creasing in Folding Screens
The method of folding also impacts screen integrity and visible creases:
*   The [[Samsung Galaxy Fold design changes | Galaxy Fold]], which folds inwards, had a "very slight crease" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   The Royole FlexPai, which folds outwards, results in two distinct creases, one on either side of the hinge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Implications for [[Folding screen technology | Folding Phone Technology]]
The experience with the Royole FlexPai suggests that being "first" to market does not matter if the product is suboptimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. A key takeaway is that folding *in* is generally better than folding *out* for folding phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. As long as screens and hinges remain delicate, inward folding appears to be the more practical and durable approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

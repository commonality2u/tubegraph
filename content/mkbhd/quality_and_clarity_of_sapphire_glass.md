The front panel of the upcoming iPhone 6 is expected to feature a sheet of [[sapphire_crystal_vs_gorilla_glass | sapphire crystal]], which is highlighted for its superior quality and optical properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. This material offers significant advantages over Gorilla Glass, which was used on the [[camera_quality_and_features_of_iphone_5s | iPhone 5S]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

## Exceptional Material Properties

Sapphire crystal is described as an "extremely high quality material" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. It is noted for being incredibly thin, specifically "paper thin," with a thickness comparable to a sheet of paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. Despite its thinness, it maintains its integrity and optical performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. The material is "insanely clear" and considered a "super high quality material" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.

## Optical Clarity

One of the most striking characteristics of sapphire glass is its optical clarity:
*   **Perfectly See-Through** The panel is "perfectly see-through," described as having "0% opacity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
*   **Minimal Distortion** When looking through the panel, there is "very little distortion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.
*   **Accurate Color Reproduction** Colors viewed through the sapphire glass remain "exact," with "absolutely no color shift" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.
*   **Recording Quality Comparison** The quality of the sapphire panel is compared favorably to the glass used in recording equipment for its clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.

## Current Applications in iPhone 5S

Apple already utilizes sapphire in the [[camera_quality_and_features_of_iphone_5s | iPhone 5S]] for specific components where high quality and clarity are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>:
*   **Camera Lens** The camera lens requires a "super high quality material" that is "very durable and crystal clear" to ensure "great shots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.
*   **Home Button** The home button, which includes the Touch ID sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>, needs to be "crystal clear" to accurately read fingerprints through the glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. The home button of the iPhone 6 is expected to be the same size as that of the [[camera_quality_and_features_of_iphone_5s | iPhone 5S]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

These applications highlight the material's suitability for components requiring both durability and optical precision.

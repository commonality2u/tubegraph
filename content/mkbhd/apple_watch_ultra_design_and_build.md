The [[comparing_apple_watch_ultra_to_other_apple_watches | Apple Watch Ultra]], initially anticipated as an "Apple Watch Pro," arrived as an upgraded, ruggedized smartwatch designed for extreme users and adventurers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Its design prioritizes ruggedness, enhanced features, and extended battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Ruggedness and Materials
The [[comparing_apple_watch_ultra_to_other_apple_watches | Apple Watch Ultra]] is significantly beefed up, measuring 49 millimeters diagonally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. It is constructed with a titanium case and a ceramic back, making it much harder to break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

## Buttons and Crown
The watch features much bigger buttons, which are easier to press, even with gloves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. It also has a larger crown and a distinct crown guard on the side, contributing to its unique look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Display
The display is protected by a flat sapphire crystal, unlike the normal curving edges of other Apple Watches. This design includes a slightly raised lip around the screen, offering protection from corner impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. The display also boasts a 2000 nits max brightness, making it the most visible smartwatch OLED outdoors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Aesthetics and Visual Impact
Despite its massive appearance, the [[comparing_apple_watch_ultra_to_other_apple_watches | Apple Watch Ultra]] is not as heavy as it looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. It only comes in one color: exposed titanium, which appears very silver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. The reviewer expressed a preference for a black option, noting that black is slimming and could make the large watch appear smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. However, it's acknowledged that black paint might scratch and reveal the silver underneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

The watch has a "computer on the wrist" aesthetic, appearing as a block rather than tapering like many traditional watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. This means it doesn't look like it "sticks out" as much as some larger circular watches, even if its physical dimensions are similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. While it's a big watch for someone accustomed to smartwatches, it's not the biggest in the overall watch market, especially when compared to massive Garmin, Suunto, or dedicated dive computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Notable Features
The [[comparing_apple_watch_ultra_to_other_apple_watches | Apple Watch Ultra]] incorporates additional features like an extra microphone and speakers for improved audio quality in windy conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. It also includes a new bright orange "Action Button" which can be mapped to one of eight functions, such as opening the workout selector or marking segments/laps within an activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

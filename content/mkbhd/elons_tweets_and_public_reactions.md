## Public Reception and Engagement

*   Comments on the [[tesla_cybertruck_market_impact | Cybertruck]] hilariously alternate between "this is amazing, this thing looks dope, it's one, I'm glad they think outside the box, I'm really happy, I want one" and "this is stupid, I hate it, it's the dumbest looking truck ever, it's the worst" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   This extreme reaction is attributed to the vehicle's angular design, which lacks a single curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

The world of tech collectibles, particularly for classic pieces, often sees significant [[value_fluctuations_in_tech_collectibles | value fluctuations in tech collectibles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Unlike common older gadgets, factory-sealed, unopened original iPhones are the most sought-after tech items in the collector's market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Finding a working used original iPhone from 2007 is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>, but an original, sealed, untouched version is "extremely rare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. This rarity makes them highly valuable, leading to instances of scams where used phones are resealed and sold as new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. The value difference between a used and a new, sealed original iPhone is "gigantic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

## Value of Original iPhones in Auction
Only about 6 million first-generation iPhones were ever sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>, and the number of unopened units continues to decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.
Recent auction prices for sealed original iPhones demonstrate their high value:
*   **February Auction:** Over $60,000 (a record at the time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>
*   **March Auction:** $55,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>
*   **Recent Chicago Auction:** $40,000 (for an iPhone with a "lucky you" sticker) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>

The price reduction for the $40,000 iPhone was possibly due to "browning around it" and a "break in the corner" of its packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.

## The Auction Experience
The process of acquiring such [[expensive_technology | expensive technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> through an auction is distinct from typical online platforms.
*   **Live Streamed:** Unlike eBay, these are "actual auction[s] like a live streamed video of a guy with a gavel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.
*   **Global Participation:** Participants can join "from anywhere in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
*   **Item Identification:** The iPhone was item number 203 in the auction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

### Bidding and Winning
When the item's turn came, an initial bid was placed, which was the minimum of $32,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. The auctioneer proceeded with the standard "going once, going twice, sold to the online bidder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, concluding the purchase instantly.

### Additional Costs
Beyond the winning bid, the total cost included:
*   Sales tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>
*   Bidding premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>
*   Shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>

## Verification of Authenticity
A significant challenge in purchasing sealed vintage tech is verifying its untouched condition.
*   **X-Rays:** Auction websites provide x-rays, which confirm the presence of accessories inside the box, but not whether they are untouched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.
*   **Serial Number Check:** Checking the serial number on Apple's system can show if the device was never registered, activated, or used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. However, this does not confirm if the item was never opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Trust Exercise
> Verifying a truly untouched, sealed original iPhone is "very much a trust exercise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>, as definitive proof of it never being opened is hard to obtain.

### Post-Purchase Assessment
Upon receiving the iPhone, indicators suggested it was genuinely new and unopened:
*   The original shrink wrap was "super old" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>.
*   The internal shrink wrap around the iPhone was "perfect looking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>.
*   The difficulty in getting a 1.0 iPhone to activate past the iTunes boot screen, a common [[challenges_of_first_generation_tech | challenge of first generation tech]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>, supported its originality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>.
*   It turned on but did not fully boot up, as expected from a 16-year-old battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>. It later charged with a new brick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>.
*   The original packaging and accessories, including a USB-A wall brick, a 30-pin dock, a 30-pin charging/data cable, and original "ear pods," were present and sealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>.
*   A "gigantic SIM card" (original size) was included, indicating its AT&T/Singular exclusivity at launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>.
*   The absence of a SIM card ejector tool, which wasn't shipped with the original iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>.
*   The presence of a black microfiber cloth and slightly askew Apple stickers were noted as original <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>.

Upon opening, the value of the iPhone "dramatically less" than the purchase price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>, indicating the premium placed on its sealed condition. This aligns with [[technology_reviews | technology reviews]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> of new products vs. collectibles.

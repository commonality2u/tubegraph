The [[Apples new AirPods and AirPods Pro features | AirPods Pro]] feature active noise cancellation, moving beyond the passive noise isolation found in standard earbuds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This technology utilizes built-in microphones to achieve additional noise cancellation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Effectiveness and Experience
Initial impressions indicate the noise cancellation is "pretty decent," performing comparably to on-ear headphones like the Beats Solo Pro, assuming a good seal is achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. It performs better than expected for earbuds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, though it may not be sufficient for environments like airplanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The cancellation is described as "pretty impressive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

A notable aspect of the [[Improved noise cancellation and transparency mode | AirPods Pro]]'s noise cancellation is the "air pass-through" system, facilitated by larger black grilles on the sides of the earbuds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This design allows air to pass through, preventing the clogged-up or vacuum-like sensation often associated with in-ear seals, while still enabling effective noise cancellation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Activating Noise Cancellation
Users have several options to activate noise cancellation or switch to [[Improved noise cancellation and transparency mode | transparency mode]]:
*   **iOS Quick Settings** Adjusting the volume settings in iOS 13.2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Stem Squeeze** Squeezing the pressure-sensitive stem of an earbud for approximately one second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Apple Watch** Activating it directly from a connected Apple Watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

Upon activation, a chime confirms the mode change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

## Transparency Mode
In addition to noise cancellation, [[Improved noise cancellation and transparency mode | transparency mode]] allows users to hear sounds from their surroundings even while wearing the earbuds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. This feature also benefits from the air pass-through design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Ear Tip Fit Test
To optimize noise cancellation and overall [[AirPods Pro sound quality | sound quality]], the [[Apples new AirPods and AirPods Pro features | AirPods Pro]] include an "ear tip fit test" within iOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. This feature plays a short sound into the ear and uses the internal microphones to assess the quality of the earbud's seal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. If the fit is not ideal, it advises the user to adjust the size of the [[AirPods Pro design and features | rubber tips]] for a better seal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. This diagnostic tool is noted as effective and a unique innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

The [[iphone_6_camera_performance_and_features | iPhone 6]], Apple's flagship phone for the year, introduces a new design focused on being thin and light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This design philosophy significantly impacts both its physical attributes and its internal components, including battery and performance capabilities.

## Performance

The iPhone 6 is equipped with a 1.4 GHz dual-core chip and 1 GB of RAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Despite these specifications, the device performs comparably to other phones featuring a 2.5 GHz chip and 3 GB of RAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. This high level of performance is attributed to Apple's vertical integration and the efficiency of its A8 chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

The camera, a consistent highlight for iPhones, is noted for being one of the best and fastest in any smartphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Its user interface and picture-taking are extremely fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. It can record high frame rate video at 30, 60, or 720p, and even 240 frames per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Fast autofocus is achieved with new technology, and a wide-open aperture glass enables great low-light performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. The camera's bias towards a faster shutter speed prevents blurriness, even by increasing ISO and relying on its "top-notch" image processing to clean up noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. This results in "crispy clean shots with excellent color" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### Software Performance

While the overall user interface is described as "very familiar" to iPhone or iPad users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>, iOS 8 is not without issues. There can be "hiccups sometimes" and "bugs sometimes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. A notable instance was the 8.0.1 update which temporarily bricked phones before being quickly fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. A significant concern is the lag in major developers updating their apps for the larger displays of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Apps not updated for the larger screen appear "big and awkward and fuzzy and strange" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

## Battery Life

The iPhone 6 features an 1810 mAh battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This capacity is considered "super small" when compared to Android flagships or other 4.7-inch phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. However, Apple's control over the A8 chip and iOS allows for optimization to maximize battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

Key characteristics of the iPhone 6 battery life:
*   **Improvement over Predecessor** The battery life is approximately 10% to 15% better than the [[battery_life_and_charging_speed_of_iphone_5s | iPhone 5s]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. While not "amazingly great," it is "not bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **Standby Time** It boasts "really good standby time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. A phone can be left at 100% charge overnight and wake up at 98% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **Light Usage** For light usage days, the phone can typically last through the entire day without issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Heavy Usage** On days with heavy usage, such as extensive web browsing, photo/video taking, video watching, or gaming, the phone is unlikely to last until the end of the day and will require charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This is a common characteristic of small, thin phones, a sacrifice Apple seems willing to make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> The speaker expressed a wish for the phone to be slightly thicker (e.g., 2000 or 2100 mAh battery) to eliminate the camera protrusion and potentially improve grip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

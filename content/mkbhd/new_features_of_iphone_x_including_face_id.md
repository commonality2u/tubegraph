The [[iPhone X]] was presented as the future of Apple's smartphones, despite its packaging not explicitly labeling it "X" (a Roman numeral for 10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Many users were advised to skip the [[Differences between iPhone X and iPhone 8 | iPhone 8]] in anticipation of this device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Unboxing and Design
The unboxing experience for the [[iPhone X]] is largely consistent with previous iPhones, including the [[Differences between iPhone X and iPhone 8 | iPhone 8]], with headphones, adapters, and stickers all included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The device itself is notably shiny and reflective, especially the silver model, while the space gray variant is more toned down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## [[Display and design of the iPhone X | Display and Design]]
A significant new feature of the [[iPhone X]] is its [[Display and design of the iPhone X | display]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. It boasts a 5.8-inch OLED "corner to corner" screen, which fits into a smaller footprint than the [[Differences between iPhone X and iPhone 8 | iPhone 8 Plus]] despite having a larger screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The [[Display and design of the iPhone X | display]] features a prominent "notch" at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The panel is described as bright, contrasty, and well-calibrated, avoiding the oversaturation sometimes seen in OLEDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## New User Interactions
With the removal of the traditional home button, the [[iPhone X]] introduces new gestures and button combinations for familiar functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>:
*   **Go Home**: A swipe-up gesture from the bottom of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Screenshot**: Pressing the power button and volume up button simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Power Off**: Long-pressing the power button and volume up key brings up the power off menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Siri**: A long press of the power button now activates Siri <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **Apple Pay**: Double-pressing the power button activates Apple Pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Multitasking/App Switching**: New gestures are introduced for managing applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

These changes mean there are more gestures and key combinations for users to memorize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## [[Face ID and facial recognition technology on iPhone X | Face ID]] and Front-Facing Camera Suite
One of the biggest differences from the [[Differences between iPhone X and iPhone 8 | iPhone 8]] is the new front-facing camera suite, located in the notch. This suite includes an IR blaster and a depth sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This technology enables several new features, most notably [[Face ID and facial recognition technology on iPhone X | Face ID]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### [[Face ID and facial recognition technology on iPhone X | Face ID]] Functionality
*   **Setup**: The setup for [[Face ID and facial recognition technology on iPhone X | Face ID]] occurs during the first boot and is described as quick and painless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Unlocking**: To unlock the phone, the user must look directly at the device, similar to the setup process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Once recognized, a small lock icon under the time opens, and the user can swipe up to access the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Security**: [[Face ID and facial recognition technology on iPhone X | Face ID]] is designed to be smart and not easily spoofed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. It does not work with a picture of the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, when the user is looking away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, or when their eyes are closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, preventing someone from unlocking the phone while the owner is asleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Further testing, including with identical twins, is planned to assess its robustness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Selfie Portrait Mode
The new front-facing camera also enables a selfie portrait mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Initial impressions suggest its performance is average, with the Pixel 2 showing more confident front-facing camera portraits, particularly concerning edge detection and hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The [[iPhone X]] sometimes struggles with background blurring, especially in specific lighting conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Both devices are expected to improve with future software updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Animojis
The new front-facing camera suite also introduces Animojis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This feature allows users to map their facial movements onto cartoon animal heads and send them via iMessage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. The physics of the Animoji movements are noted as being quite accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

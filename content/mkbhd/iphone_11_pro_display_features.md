The [[design_and_display_of_iphone_11_pro | iPhone 11 Pro]] and [[design_and_display_of_iphone_11_pro | iPhone 11 Pro Max]] were introduced as Apple's new flagship iPhones, with the display being one of four key areas of improvement alongside battery, cameras, and the new matte finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## General Display Characteristics

The display design of the [[design_and_display_of_iphone_11_pro | iPhone 11 Pro]] is nearly identical to the iPhone Xs and Xs Max, retaining the same sizes, resolution, OLED technology, and notch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Despite the similarities, it offers improvements over the [[iphone_x_display_features_and_performance | iPhone Xs]] display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### Super Retina XDR Display

Apple refers to this new display as the "Super Retina XDR display" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. It is touted as a better screen for watching movies and editing photos and videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Brightness and Contrast

A significant improvement is the increased brightness. The display now achieves a peak brightness of 1200 nits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. It also boasts a 2 million to 1 contrast ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## 3D Touch Replaced by Haptic Touch

The 3D Touch feature, which allowed for pressure-sensitive presses, has been removed from the [[design_and_display_of_iphone_11_pro | iPhone 11 Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. It has been replaced by "haptic presses," which are long presses that perform essentially the same functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Missing "Pro" Display Features

Despite the "Pro" moniker, the display does not include certain features often associated with professional-grade displays:
*   **No 120Hz ProMotion Display** The display does not feature a 120Hz high refresh rate ProMotion display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **No USB-C** The device still uses Lightning, not the more common USB-C which might be expected on a "Pro" device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

However, it is generally considered to have one of the best displays of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

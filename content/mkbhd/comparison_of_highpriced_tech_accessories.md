## Apple's Strategy with High-Priced Accessories

Apple, as a tech company, has uniquely positioned itself as the "luxury one" in the tech world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This status allows them to charge more for many of their products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. To maintain this premium image, they balance competitively priced products, like the $329 [[pricing_and_value_comparison_with_other_ipads | iPad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a> and the $400 [[price_versus_value_in_smartphones | iPhone SE]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, with very high-priced accessories that reinforce their luxury branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

This strategy involves creating products that are "so expensive that people aren't really mad that they can't get it, but it's super easy to make fun of" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, similar to other luxury brands such as Supreme, Gucci, Rolex, and Bugatti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The price of an item can also influence its perceived quality, with studies showing that people often assume a higher-priced item is better, even if functionally identical to a cheaper one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

### Media Attention

Another aspect of this strategy is generating media attention. "All press is good press" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Articles about Apple's "crazy wheels" or other expensive accessories often mention other Apple products, shedding light on the Mac Pro and Apple's history, and sometimes even listing other Apple products that could be bought for the same price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. This attention serves to further Apple's brand and overall presence.

## Examples of High-Priced Accessories

### Mac Pro Wheels

Initially perceived as ridiculous and insulting due to their cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, the Mac Pro Wheels are a notable example of Apple's high-priced accessories.

#### Pricing
*   As an option when configuring a new Mac Pro: $400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
*   Purchased separately for self-installation: $700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>

#### Design and Quality
Objectively, these wheels are described as "the nicest computer wheels I've ever seen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a> and "complete and total overkill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a> compared to typical dusty plastic casters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Materials:** Entirely metal and rubber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, feeling hefty and largely solid metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Weight:** One wheel weighs more than twice an iPhone 11 Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Functionality:** They fully articulate 360 degrees at every joint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. The two independent, super smooth rubber treads allow for a tighter turning radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Included Accessories:** A metal dual-sided hex tool with a rubberized sleeve for grip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, and two nearly identical installation guides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

#### Perceived Value
Despite their high quality, the value of the wheels is questioned, as they primarily serve to put the Mac Pro on wheels without brakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, and the Mac Pro must remain plugged into a wall to operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. One argument for the high price is the significant tooling cost required to produce such high-quality wheels, combined with the low expected sales volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. However, Apple regularly subsidizes less successful products with more successful ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, suggesting the pricing is more strategic than purely cost-recovery based.

### Other Notable Accessories

*   **Mac Pro Monitor Stand:** A "thousand dollar monitor stand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a> (likely referring to the Pro Stand for the Pro Display XDR).
*   **Apple Coffee Table Book:** A "300 dollar coffee table book" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **Gold Apple Watch:** A "$17,000 gold Apple Watch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a> (referring to the discontinued Apple Watch Edition).

While "pretty much no one in their right mind should buy any of these" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, their existence makes perfect sense within Apple's broader strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. The more these "crazy" accessories are discussed, the more attention Apple receives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

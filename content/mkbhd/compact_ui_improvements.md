In iOS 14, Apple introduced a series of changes categorized as "compact UI" to address elements that previously took up the entire screen unnecessarily [00:04:36]. These updates aim to provide a less intrusive and more fluid user experience [00:04:46].

## Incoming Calls and FaceTime
Previously, incoming phone or FaceTime calls would dominate the entire screen [00:04:47]. With the new compact UI, these calls now appear as a drop-down notification at the top of the screen [00:04:53]. Users can easily hide the notification, accept, or reject the call without interrupting their current activity [00:04:55].

## Picture-in-Picture for Video and FaceTime
[[user_interface_and_user_experience | True multitasking]] is enhanced with widely supported picture-in-picture functionality across the OS [00:05:23].
*   **General Video:** When watching a full-screen video in apps like Apple TV or Safari, users can swipe up to go home, and the video will shrink into a picture-in-picture window that continues playing [00:05:29]. This window can be resized, moved to any corner, or swiped off to the side, allowing the audio to continue playing in the background while the visual is hidden [00:05:42].
*   **FaceTime:** During a FaceTime call, users can swipe up to return to the home screen and perform other tasks without pausing their video or stopping the camera [00:05:05]. The FaceTime call continues in a movable picture-in-picture window [00:05:10].

## Compact Siri Interface
Prior versions of iOS featured Siri as a full-screen takeover [00:06:02]. In iOS 14, Siri now appears as a small animation at the bottom of the screen [00:06:06]. When a question is asked, the answer pops up at the top [00:06:21]. While the animation is smaller and doesn't take up the whole screen, direct interaction with content underneath Siri still requires exiting the interface [00:06:26]. Despite this, users can still see what is underneath while interacting with Siri [00:06:42].

The rapid advancements in [[advancements_in_ai_generated_videos | AI-generated videos]] have introduced both impressive capabilities and significant ethical and societal concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The progression from early, visibly artificial creations like the "Will Smith eating spaghetti" video to highly realistic outputs in a single year highlights this rapid development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. This technological leap, comparable to the impact of ChatGPT and DALL.E <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, brings into question the authenticity of digital media and the future of human creative professions.

## The Reality of AI-Generated Video: Sora

OpenAI's new model, Sora, can generate video clips up to one minute long from text input alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Unlike image generation, video generation requires the AI to understand complex interactions of reflections, textures, materials, and physics over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. While current AI-generated videos are not perfect and still contain imperfections upon close inspection (e.g., unnatural movements, inconsistent camera work, or strange physics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>, they are already incredibly convincing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. This is particularly concerning because not all viewers are actively looking for AI artifacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

> "you're about to watch a bunch of AI generated videos and you know that you're about to watch a bunch of AI generated content. So your brain, you're already looking for this stuff and it's not perfect, you will find imperfections, but not everybody who sees AI generated content on the internet knows to be looking for that." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>

Furthermore, the technology is only getting better; the current iteration is the "worst that this technology is going to be from here on out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

## Ethical Concerns

### Deception and Authenticity

The ability of AI-generated videos to "pass as real videos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a> for unsuspecting viewers poses significant risks. This is especially "insanely sketchy during an election year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>, where deepfakes could be used to create misleading content involving politicians or other public figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. The general ease with which realistic fake content can be produced could erode public trust in visual media.

### Economic Impact on Creators and Industries

The advancements in AI video generation have profound [[implications_of_ai_technology_on_video_creation | implications for video creation]] and the livelihoods of human professionals. [[impact_of_ai_on_video_licensing_and_stock_footage | Stock video generation]] is expected to "take a dent out of video licensing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Industries that rely on specific stock footage, such as presentations, advertisements, and PowerPoints, could opt for AI-generated alternatives that are free or subscription-based, rather than paying for licensed human-shot footage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. This could displace drone pilots, photographers, and videographers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

> "How long until an entire ad, every single shot is completely generated with AI? Or what about an entire YouTube video or an entire movie?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>

## Societal Concerns and Safeguards

### Watermarking and Control

To mitigate risks, OpenAI includes a watermark in the bottom corner of every video generated by Sora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. This serves as an indicator that the content is AI-generated, assuming the watermark is not cropped out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Developers like OpenAI are expected to implement "a whole bunch of safety stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>, potentially more stringent than for image generation.

### Restrictions on Likenesses

A critical safety measure involves preventing the generation of specific individuals' likenesses, particularly politicians, to curb the spread of misinformation and deepfakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. This implies that generating content like "Will Smith eating spaghetti" may no longer be possible through such tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

## Future Implications

The rapid rate of improvement in AI models is genuinely shocking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This raises existential questions about the nature of creativity itself: if AI is trained on all human-made videos, can it truly be innovative or creative in ways humans haven't already been <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>? The ongoing development of these technologies will continue to challenge existing norms and necessitate careful consideration of their broader impact on society.

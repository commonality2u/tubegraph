Apple quietly released the new [[apples_new_airpods_and_airpods_pro_features | AirPods Pro]], which cost $250, placing them in the high-end headphone market [00:00:51].

## Design and Build

The [[airpods_pro_2_design_and_new_features | AirPods Pro]] feature a new design that is slightly smaller with a shorter stem [00:01:14]. They are described as "less toothbrushy" and more compact, which is considered an improvement over previous designs and other headphones like the Microsoft Surface Buds [00:01:30]. While rumors suggested a black pair, they are currently only available in glossy white [00:01:42].

A significant design enhancement is their IPX4 water resistance rating, making them sweat-resistant and suitable for light rain [00:01:54]. They also come with rubber tips, including small, medium (pre-attached), and large sizes, which are crucial for a good seal [00:02:06]. The earbuds themselves feature a larger black grille on the sides, designed for air to pass through, preventing a "clogged up" feeling typical with in-ear seals [00:03:28].

## Features

### H1 Chip and Initial Setup
The [[airpods_pro_2_design_and_new_features | AirPods Pro]] retain the H1 chip, allowing for quick pairing by simply opening the case near an iPhone [00:02:21]. Upon pairing, a tutorial guides users through media controls, message read-aloud features with Siri and iOS 13.2, and noise cancellation [00:02:26].

### Active Noise Cancellation
A key new feature is active noise cancellation (ANC), which utilizes microphones in the earbuds to provide additional noise reduction beyond passive isolation [00:02:41]. Initial impressions suggest the ANC is "pretty decent," comparable to the Beats Solo Pro (on-ear headphones), and better than expected for earbuds [00:03:02]. Users can activate noise cancellation in several ways: via quick settings in iOS 13.2, by squeezing the pressure-sensitive stem for about a second, or from an Apple Watch [00:03:45]. The ANC delivers a good experience without the common "vacuum feeling" due to the air pass-through design [00:04:06].

### Transparency Mode
The air pass-through design also enables Transparency Mode, which allows users to hear sounds around them even while wearing the earbuds [00:03:42].

### Ear Tip Fit Test
iOS includes an "Ear Tip Fit Test" feature, which uses the internal microphones to play a sound and determine if the user has a good seal with the chosen rubber tips [00:04:12]. If the fit isn't optimal, it advises adjusting the tip size for a better seal [00:04:29].

## [[airpods_pro_sound_quality | Sound Quality]]
Initial impressions of the [[airpods_pro_sound_quality | sound quality]] indicate they sound "fine" [00:04:43]. They reportedly sound better with noise cancellation activated, and "okay" without it [00:04:48].

## [[apples_airpods_pro_case | Charging Case]]
The new [[apples_airpods_pro_case | case]] for the [[airpods_pro_2_design_and_new_features | AirPods Pro]] is slightly larger and wider than the previous AirPods case, though not drastically [00:05:06]. It retains wireless charging capabilities from the second-generation AirPods case, remains very pocketable, and provides quick charging for a total of 24 hours of battery life [00:05:17]. The case still uses a Lightning port for charging, rather than USB-C [00:05:27].

## Overall Impressions
The [[airpods_pro_2_design_and_new_features | AirPods Pro]] offer a complete package of new features [00:05:55]. They aim to solve a previous issue with AirPods, which often fell out of the ear and didn't offer great sound quality [00:05:59]. The new rubber tips are designed to prevent them from falling out easily, and the [[airpods_pro_sound_quality | sound quality]] is improved [00:06:17]. The active noise cancellation is noted as particularly impressive [00:06:43].

The [[airpods_pro_pricing_and_availability | AirPods Pro are available on Apple's site immediately, with in-store availability starting October 30th]] [00:06:31].

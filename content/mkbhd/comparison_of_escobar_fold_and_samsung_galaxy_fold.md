In 2020, folding smartphones were gaining traction, with various options available, though many were not recommended for purchase due to their nascent technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Notable models included the Galaxy Z Flip, the [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Samsung Galaxy Fold]], and the Moto Razr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Amidst these, a new folding phone surfaced from Escobar Inc., generating significant interest due to its low price and association with the notorious Escobar name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Escobar Fold (Original)

The first Escobar folding phone, priced at $350 with free shipping, garnered attention with its gold accent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Upon closer inspection of its specifications and design, it was revealed to be a Royole FlexPai with a gold accent taped onto it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Orders placed for this device in December 2019, like the one by MKBHD, were often never fulfilled, with order trackers remaining in "pending" or "in production" status for months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The company's website was described as "a little suspect," featuring "pretty wild pictures and statements" and appearing generally unprofessional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Escobar Fold 2

Following the original model, the [[escobar_folding_phone_controversy | Escobar Fold 2]] was introduced at a price of $400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### Appearance and Design

The [[escobar_folding_phone_controversy | Escobar Fold 2]] visually resembles a [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Samsung Galaxy Fold]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The [[unboxing_experience_of_the_samsung_galaxy_fold | unboxing experience]] was simple, and within seconds of use, it was apparent that the device was a legitimate [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Samsung Galaxy Fold]], specifically the newer version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

The key differences in design were minimal:
*   **Gold Foil Adhesive**: The [[escobar_folding_phone_controversy | Escobar Fold 2]] is an actual [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Galaxy Fold]] with gold tinfoil adhesive applied to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This foil can be removed with a box cutter, knife, or enough heat, revealing the Samsung logo underneath on the back and hinge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Rebranding Quality**: The rebranding effort is described as "poor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Pre-installed Content**: The phone comes with "weird pre-installed mugshot wallpapers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

### Functionality and Comparison to Samsung Galaxy Fold

The [[escobar_folding_phone_controversy | Escobar Fold 2]] is a "fully working" [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Galaxy Fold]], albeit without any of the items normally included in the box with a genuine [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Samsung Galaxy Fold]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Reviewing the [[escobar_folding_phone_controversy | Escobar Fold 2]] is essentially reviewing a [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Samsung Galaxy Fold]] with a gold sticker on the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

A significant point of comparison is the price:
*   **Escobar Fold 2**: $400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>
*   **Samsung Galaxy Fold**: $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>

### Alleged Business Practices

It is theorized that Escobar Inc. operates by identifying orders placed by YouTubers or tech media personalities and shipping devices to them, while not shipping to the general public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. This strategy appears to be an attempt to generate positive coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. For example, an order for the original Escobar Fold, placed by MKBHD, was eventually upgraded to a [[escobar_folding_phone_controversy | Fold 2]] and shipped after a critical tweet was posted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Other tech reviewers reported similar upgrade experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

The company's marketing tactics are notable and aggressive:
*   **YouTube Channel**: Their YouTube channel features unusual content, including a one-minute video panning across five phones (potentially all they had made) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **"RIP Samsung" Video**: A video titled "RIP Samsung" shows non-rebranded [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Galaxy Fold]]s being smashed with sledgehammers until they catch fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Website Redirect**: The domain "ripsamsung.com" redirects to "escobarinc.com," which is ironic given the [[escobar_folding_phone_controversy | Escobar Fold]]'s reliance on Samsung's product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Celebrity Endorsements**: The company produced endorsement videos featuring Chris Hansen and Anka, who appear to have been hired through a service like Cameo, potentially without full knowledge of how their videos would be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[escobar_folding_phone_controversy | Escobar Fold]] series, particularly the [[escobar_folding_phone_controversy | Fold 2]], is fundamentally a rebranded [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Samsung Galaxy Fold]] with a gold foil exterior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. While the product itself is a functional [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Galaxy Fold]], the business practices of Escobar Inc. are highly suspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Due to widespread reports of customers not receiving their orders, it is strongly advised against purchasing anything from Escobar Inc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. While the [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design | Galaxy Fold]] itself is a pricey device, buying an [[escobar_folding_phone_controversy | Escobar Fold]] is considered an unnecessary financial risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

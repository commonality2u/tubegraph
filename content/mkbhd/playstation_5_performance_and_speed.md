The PlayStation 5 (PS5) introduces significant generational improvements in performance and speed, aiming to deliver a truly next-gen gaming experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

## Overall Speed and Responsiveness

The PS5 experience is notably faster and redesigned compared to previous generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. The user interface (UI) is quick, with menus and the store flying by, and games launching rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. This speed is a direct result of the significantly faster SSD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

## Faster Load Times

A major focus for the new generation of consoles was improved specifications, new horsepower, and faster storage to achieve quicker load times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. While the PS5 doesn't have the "quick resume" feature found on the Xbox Series X, its performance is very close, directly resulting from its fast SSD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. Load times are noticeably faster in every game, whether it's a PS5-optimized title or a backward-compatible PS4 game, adding to the next-gen gaming feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>.

### Storage Capacity
The PS5 box states 825GB of storage, but after the operating system is installed, users will have approximately 670GB available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. Newer games can have very large file sizes, for example, Spider-Man: Miles Morales is about 40GB and NBA 2K is a little less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. External SSD support is available for saving backward-compatible games only, not for playing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

## Gaming Graphics and Frame Rates

The PS5 brings significant graphical improvements, including ray tracing, better reflections, shadows, high resolution, and high frame rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>. Individually, these elements might not seem to make a huge difference, but combined, they create a distinct next-gen feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.

### Spider-Man: Miles Morales Example
Spider-Man: Miles Morales serves as a prime example of the PS5's graphical capabilities, showcasing ray tracing with its reflections and lighting in a crowded New York City setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>. The game offers two distinct modes that define the console experience:
*   **High Fidelity Mode**: This mode enables ray tracing, offering the best-looking version of the game with the highest quality textures and details. However, it is limited to 30 frames per second (fps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. In this mode, reflective surfaces like windows and glass show realistic reflections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>.
*   **High Performance Mode**: Switching to this mode disables ray tracing, replacing realistic reflections with fake ones. This allows the game to run at a much smoother 60fps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>. Even without full ray tracing, the game still looks "pretty damn good" with excellent lighting and particle effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>. The reviewer personally preferred the 60fps performance mode for its smooth motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>.

The ray tracing on PS5 is described as "partial," meaning most obvious large glass surfaces show reflections, but some puddles and car windows only show lighting and shadows without full reflections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. Not every surface or texture is of super high quality, but for most players, this won't be noticeable during gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>.

### NBA 2K21
NBA 2K21, a next-gen title for PS5, focuses its realism on material appearances, including accurate player hair textures, sweat reflecting lights, and detailed court textures with hardwood reflections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>. Cutscenes also benefit from a polished, refined look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>.

## Comparison to Gaming PCs

The PS5 offers a compelling value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. If it were a [[comparison_between_ps5_and_gaming_pcs | gaming PC]], it would be considered extremely small, inexpensive at $500, and promised to remain relevant for about four years, potentially even improving over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. It would be challenging to find a [[comparison_between_gaming_pcs_and_new_consoles | gaming PC]] that is as small, cheap, and relevant for such a long period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. However, console quality graphics have historically not matched [[comparison_between_gaming_pcs_and_new_consoles | PC quality graphics]], primarily due to the graphical prowess of dedicated PC components. For instance, achieving [[gaming_performance_in_8k_resolution | 8K gaming]] at 60fps with full ray tracing and high-quality graphics requires a much larger and more expensive PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.

## Quiet Operation

A significant improvement over the PS4, the PS5 operates quietly, no longer sounding like a "jet after five minutes of gaming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>. This quiet performance is a welcome change for users.

## Controller's Impact on Performance Feel

The DualSense controller contributes significantly to the "next-gen" feel through its haptics and adaptive triggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>. While some games, like Spider-Man, underutilize these features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>, titles like Astro's Playroom showcase how haptics can make sand feel like sand and ice feel like ice through the hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>.

A notable example of adaptive trigger usage in NBA 2K21 demonstrates how the controller can communicate game performance to the player:
*   The sprint trigger becomes harder to pull as the player's in-game character becomes more tired and fatigued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>. This allows players to *feel* when their character is tired without having to look at the screen, enhancing the immersive "next-gen" sensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>.

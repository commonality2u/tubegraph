The [[Apple Magic Keyboard case features | Apple Magic Keyboard case]] for the iPad Pro has significantly impacted the discussion around whether the iPad Pro can serve as a full-time computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Previously, there were YouTube channels dedicated solely to reviewing cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, but this particular case stands out as one of the most interesting in a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Initial Impressions and Hype

Upon its release, the [[Apple Magic Keyboard case features | new Apple Magic Keyboard case]] generated considerable hype, partly due to its announcement alongside a new iPad Pro that was only minimally different from its predecessor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The introduction of official mouse and cursor support for the iPad further fueled the debate about the iPad Pro's potential as a primary computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

After using the new iPad Pro with the [[Apple Magic Keyboard case features | Magic Keyboard case]] as a primary computer, it's concluded that this combination offers the best version of the iPad as a computer to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. However, the preference for a traditional laptop still remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## [[Apple Magic Keyboard case features | Magic Keyboard Case]] Features

The [[Apple Magic Keyboard case features | Magic Keyboard case]] is a substantial and well-built accessory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Design and Build
*   **Top Part**: Utilizes strong magnets to securely lock onto the iPad, preventing accidental detachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Hinge**: A long metal tube that features a USB-C pass-through port for charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This hinge is stiff, similar to a laptop, and allows the iPad to hover above the keyboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Base**: Made of a silicon rubberized material, consistent with previous Apple cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Keyboard and Trackpad
*   **Keyboard**: Full-size and backlit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. It uses scissor switches, offering a satisfying travel and a clicky feel akin to the new MacBook Air and 16-inch MacBook Pro keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The board is stiff with no flex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. The backlight, while drawing some power, is a welcome addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. It is considered the best keyboard seen in an iPad case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Trackpad**: While not as large as a full-size laptop trackpad, it's functional and completes the laptop-like experience with the new iOS cursor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. It supports physical clicks across its entire surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

### Weight
The [[Apple Magic Keyboard case features | Magic Keyboard case]] significantly adds to the iPad Pro's weight. The larger iPad Pro weighs 640 grams, and the case itself weighs 702 grams, making the combined setup thicker and heavier than a MacBook Air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Usability as a Computer

The combination of the iPad Pro and [[Apple Magic Keyboard case features | Magic Keyboard case]] creates a device that feels like a 13-inch laptop with a 120Hz screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Challenges and Quirks
Despite its improvements, using the iPad Pro as a main computer still presents several quirks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>:
*   **Weight Distribution**: Unlike a laptop where the bulk of the weight is in the base, the iPad Pro (as the computer) is at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This can make the setup feel top-heavy, despite the case's added weight designed to counteract this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. While "lappable" in most classic laptop positions, it's not as flexible as a truly bottom-weighted laptop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Missing Keys**:
    *   There is no escape key, requiring users to touch the screen to exit full-screen video or other functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
    *   There are no function buttons for brightness, volume, or keyboard backlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Adjusting keyboard brightness, for instance, requires navigating deep into the settings app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **App Management**: The "Command Q" shortcut for quitting apps, common on Macs, doesn't work the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. To close an app without touching the screen, one must navigate to the command-tab menu, find the app, and then use Command Q <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Learning Curve**: There are numerous trackpad gestures and keyboard shortcuts to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Holding down the Command key reveals a list of available shortcuts for the current app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **Multitasking Limitations**: Simple multitasking tasks, like skipping a song on Spotify while typing a review, or taking notes during a Zoom call, are significantly more cumbersome or impractical compared to a laptop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## [[Pricing and value comparison with other iPads | Pricing and Value Comparison]]

A MacBook Air typically costs around $1200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. The 13-inch iPad Pro costs $1000, and with the $350 [[Apple Magic Keyboard case features | Magic Keyboard case]], the total comes to $1350 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## Conclusion: [[Comparison of iPad Pro with laptop | iPad Pro vs. Laptop]]

If forced to choose between a laptop and the iPad Pro with the [[Apple Magic Keyboard case features | Magic Keyboard case]], some users might lean towards the iPad Pro for its versatilityâ€”the ability to detach and use it as a tablet, its 120Hz screen, and wider app availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. However, a laptop is often still necessary, particularly for complex multitasking scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

In the world of iPads, there are two main user types:
1.  Those who keep their iPad in a case/keyboard all the time, using it predominantly as a fixed-form device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
2.  Those who frequently pop the iPad out of its case, using it mostly as a tablet, and only attach the keyboard when typing is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

For the second type of user, the iPad Pro with the [[Apple Magic Keyboard case features | Magic Keyboard case]] is considered the best possible version of the iPad, making it an excellent and recommended purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. However, for those who require the full functionality and flexibility of a traditional laptop, it will not be a complete replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

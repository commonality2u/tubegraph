Meta, formerly Facebook, has committed significant resources to the metaverse, despite a more than 60% drop in Meta stock and flatlined growth for Facebook in the past year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has doubled down on this investment, pouring substantial amounts of money into the initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Defining Virtual and Augmented Reality

To understand the metaverse, it's important to define its core technologies:
*   **[[virtual_reality_vr_and_augmented_reality_ar | Virtual reality (VR)]]**: Involves wearing a headset to be completely immersed in a new virtual world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **[[virtual_reality_vr_and_augmented_reality_ar | Augmented reality (AR)]]**: Involves overlaying virtual elements on top of the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

Both VR and AR are difficult to demo effectively, as experiencing them firsthand is crucial for understanding and appreciating their capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. There is curiosity about VR, with questions arising about whether it's merely a tech trend like 3D TVs or a glimpse into the future akin to *Ready Player One* or *Wall-E* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Meta's Strategic Shift Towards the Metaverse

Meta is the primary mega-company dedicating all its efforts to this future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The internet, as it currently exists, is largely controlled by ads and devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Google, for instance, operates as an ads business by connecting people to products through advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

Historically, Facebook aimed to create popular devices but never succeeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. By 2022, Facebook had saturated its market and began a slow decline, especially after the iPhone's "Ask App Not to Track" feature significantly impacted Facebook's ad business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. In response, Meta is looking to the next big thing, which they believe is [[virtual_reality_vr_and_augmented_reality_ar | VR and AR]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

Their strategy is to control as much of this [[corporate_strategies_for_metaverse_dominance | VR future]] as possible—including software, hardware, ads, and content—to regain influence and revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This ambition led to their rebranding as Meta and billions of dollars in investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## The [[meta_quest_pro_headset_features | Meta Quest Pro Headset]]

The [[meta_quest_pro_headset_features | Meta Quest Pro]], priced at $1,500, is technologically advanced and comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Design**: Components are balanced with displays and lenses at the front, speakers and buttons in the middle, and the battery at the back, making it lighter than it appears and comfortable to wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Without side blockers, it allows for peripheral vision light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   **Specifications**: It features a custom Snapdragon XR2+ processor, 256GB of storage, 12GB of RAM, and slimmer displays/lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Screens offer 1920x1800 resolution per eye at up to 90 FPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Capabilities**: The headset provides decent full-color passthrough using 10 external sensors and cameras, allowing users to feel present in a normal environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. New Touch Pro controllers have their own cameras and sensors, charging on a single dock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Battery Life**: A notable drawback is the short 1.5-hour battery life when unplugged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Tracking**: Internal sensors enable face and eye tracking, allowing virtual avatars to mirror real-time facial expressions and movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. This feature enables realistic emotional conveyance in virtual environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

Although the headset is currently large and not foldable for travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, Meta envisions future versions becoming much smaller, eventually resembling regular glasses or lightweight devices like [[retro_technology_in_modern_content | Google Glass]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This potential for advancement fuels the belief that sustained investment will lead to amazing, portable tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Metaverse Applications and Future Vision

Meta's plan for the metaverse involves replicating real-world online activities in VR and investing heavily to make these virtual versions superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Gaming**: Gaming is already well-established in VR, and Meta's investment aims to entice developers to rapidly improve game variety, fidelity, and immersion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **Meetings and Collaboration**: Meta has developed virtual meeting rooms that enhance traditional Zoom calls by offering immersive environments with breakout rooms and presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
    *   While current avatars are customizable, they are described as "cringey" and resemble Nintendo Wii Mi characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
    *   However, Meta has demonstrated a "live Avatar demo" that uses phone scans to create photorealistic avatars in VR, complete with real-time face and eye tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This promises to enable eye contact, relative audio positioning, and private conversations in virtual meetings, features not possible in standard video calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   **Remote Work**: Meta is building [[virtual_reality_applications_at_disney | virtual office buildings]] to facilitate global collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. The Quest Pro also offers native Mac support, allowing users to project their Mac screen onto multiple large virtual displays, effectively providing a portable triple-monitor setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. Meta has partnered with Microsoft to integrate Office 365 into virtual work rooms and with Accenture to equip thousands of employees with VR headsets for virtual work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

Meta's strategy involves dumping vast amounts of money into the VR ecosystem, often acquiring VR tech startups to accelerate development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

## Concerns and Competition

A significant concern is the idea of [[concerns_over_centralized_control_of_virtual_environments | one company controlling the entire foundation of this "second-generation internet" or metaverse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Meta aims to build the next foundational platform, controlling all experiences that develop on it, from workrooms to games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. They are investing heavily to gain an early and substantial lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

While other companies like Pico and Google are developing VR technologies, and Apple is expected to unveil its own VR headset, potentially making Meta nervous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>, Meta has already built numerous connections and acquired many VR companies and studios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. Despite Meta's strong position to make this technology mainstream, the potential for one company, particularly Meta, to have extensive control over users and the future of the internet (e.g., through eye-tracking for ads) is a major concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. True competition is seen as beneficial, as it incentivizes companies to improve their products and services, ultimately benefiting consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

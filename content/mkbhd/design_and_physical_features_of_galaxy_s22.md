The [[comparison_of_galaxy_s22_to_sports_teams | Galaxy S22 series]] offers a "drama-free" and "boring" design, but this contributes to its overall quiet excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:10]</a>. The phone's design is refined, taking a good foundation and making it better without taking huge risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[01:10]</a>.

## General Design and Build
The Galaxy S22 features a design very similar to its predecessor, but it is slightly smaller and more squared off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[01:17]</a>. A notable upgrade is the switch from plastic to glass on the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[01:20]</a>. If used without a case, the area where the finger rests under the [[camera_capabilities_and_improvements_in_galaxy_s22 | camera]] bump can feel a bit sharp, though users may quickly adjust to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[01:24]</a>.

Key physical attributes include:
*   **IP68 Water Resistance**: The phone is expectedly IP68 water resistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[01:32]</a>.
*   **Speakers & Buttons**: It boasts solid speakers and clicky buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[01:34]</a>.
*   **Fingerprint Reader**: It incorporates a top-tier ultrasonic fingerprint reader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[01:37]</a>.
*   **Finish**: The device has a nice satin finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[01:38]</a>.

## In-Hand Feel and Size
Samsung prioritized a better in-hand feel by making both the Galaxy S22 and S22 Plus smaller than their previous generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[01:50]</a>.
*   The S22 Plus decreased from 6.7 inches to 6.6 inches diagonally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[01:55]</a>.
*   The smaller S22 reduced from 6.2 inches to 6.1 inches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[02:01]</a>.

Despite still having a 6-inch screen, the S22 offers a surprisingly "compact feel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[02:06]</a>. This perception is enhanced by the flat sides, tiny symmetrical bezels, and the corner-to-corner [[display_technology_and_specifications_of_galaxy_s22 | display]], making it feel as compact as possible for its size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[02:15]</a>.

## Vibration Motor
A subtle but noticeable change from the previous year's model is the vibration motor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[06:31]</a>. While the haptics remain strong, clicky, and responsive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[06:38]</a>, Samsung switched from a z-axis to an x-axis vibration motor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[06:45]</a>. This change in the pulsing direction makes the vibrations feel less strong in a pocket or on a table, potentially leading to missed notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[06:57]</a>. The reason for this change might be related to space savings within the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[07:23]</a>.

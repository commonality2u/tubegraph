The smartphone industry has seen a rapid acceleration in charging speeds over the years, with new companies consistently pushing the boundaries of what's possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">00:00:03</a>.

## The Race for Speed

Initially, a flagship iPhone charged at 5 watts, taking about 2.5 hours to go from 0 to 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">00:00:10</a>. This was considered fairly standard at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">00:00:14</a>.

Key milestones in fast charging evolution include:
*   **Pixel 1:** Introduced "super fast charging" at 18 watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">00:00:18</a>.
*   **iPhone:** Soon increased its charging to 20 watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">00:00:22</a>.
*   **OnePlus:** Led the market for a couple of years with 30 watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">00:00:24</a>.
*   **Rapid Increases:** Speeds quickly advanced to 45, 65, and then 80 watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">00:00:31</a>.
*   **Xiaomi 12 Pro:** Ships with a 120-watt charger, capable of charging a phone from 0 to 100% in 17 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">00:00:34</a>.
*   **Oppo Demo:** Demonstrated a theoretical 240-watt charging system, which could charge a phone from 0 to 100% in just 9 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">00:00:48</a>.

## Public Concerns and Battery Basics

Despite these advancements, public comments often express concern that such high charging speeds will lead to overheating and damage to the smartphone's battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">00:01:06</a>. This concern prompts the question: [[impact_of_fast_charging_on_smartphone_battery_health | Is fast charging actually ruining your battery]]? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">00:01:27</a>

Modern phones universally use lithium-ion or lithium-polymer batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">00:01:42</a>. These batteries work by lithium ions flowing from a negative to a positive side through a liquid electrolyte solution, releasing energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">00:01:48</a>. Charging reverses this process, moving ions back from the positive to the negative side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">00:02:08</a>.

### The Charging Curve

Batteries behave similarly to a sponge: they absorb the most energy when nearly empty and become less efficient as they approach full capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">00:02:16</a>. Any excess energy not absorbed manifests as heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">00:02:33</a>. Fast charging numbers (e.g., 100W, 150W) represent the *peak* charging rate, not a constant rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">00:02:41</a>. A 65-watt charger, for instance, typically only hits its peak wattage for the first few minutes from a low battery, then gradually reduces the wattage, often trickle-charging at lower power after reaching about 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">00:02:51</a>.

### Battery Degradation

Batteries naturally degrade over time, with [[battery_life_and_charging | battery health]] visible on iPhones as a percentage in settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">00:03:15</a>. Factors contributing to degradation include:
*   **Natural Cycle Degradation:** As ions repeatedly pass through the electrolyte solution during charging and discharging, it slowly breaks down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">00:03:52</a>.
*   **Extreme States of Charge:** Batteries do not perform optimally when held at exactly 100% or 0% charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">00:03:50</a>.
*   **Heat:** The number one factor that accelerates battery degradation is heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">00:04:09</a>. High temperatures can cause the electrolyte salts to crystallize, clogging the anodes and cathodes and reducing the battery's ability to store lithium ions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">00:04:15</a>.

## [[techniques_to_minimize_heat_generation_during_fast_charging | Mitigating Heat in Fast Charging]]

To counter the heat generated by higher wattages, smartphone companies have developed several technologies:

### 1. Power Management in the Charging Brick
OnePlus's Warp Charge 30T, while still 30 watts, was faster than its predecessor because power management was handled in the wall brick rather than the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">00:05:23</a>. This shifted heat production away from the phone and battery, allowing sustained high power delivery to the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">00:05:40</a>. The trade-off is often a larger power brick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">00:05:59</a>.

### 2. Parallel Charging
Many companies now use parallel charging, splitting the battery into two cells and adding power management hardware to divide the incoming power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">00:06:06</a>. This allows 50 watts to be pumped into a phone by sending 25 watts to two separate battery cells, generating significantly less heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">00:06:27</a>. A minor downside is a slightly smaller overall [[battery_life_and_charging_capabilities | battery capacity]] due to the space taken by the additional boundary and management hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">00:06:47</a>.

### 3. Enhanced Cooling Hardware
Modern phones frequently incorporate more cooling hardware, such as heat shields, vapor chambers, or even internal fans, to manage heat within the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">00:07:08</a>. Better cooling allows more power to be delivered to the phone without excessive heat buildup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">00:07:35</a>.

### 4. Gallium Nitride (GaN) Chargers
New gallium nitride chargers allow for much smaller power bricks while maintaining the same high wattage output, offering a more compact solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">00:10:06</a>.

## Industry Standards and Smart Battery Features

The industry standard for battery health is typically set at 80% capacity after 800 charge cycles, which equates to roughly two years of daily charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">00:08:03</a>.
*   **Xiaomi:** Claims their 120-watt charging technology maintains 80% [[battery_life_and_charging | battery health]] after 800 charge cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">00:09:00</a>.
*   **Apple:** States 80% after 500 charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">00:09:11</a>, though real-world performance often exceeds this, as seen with an iPhone 13 Pro maintaining 97% capacity after 5 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">00:03:31</a>.
*   **Oppo/OnePlus:** Aim for 80% battery health after 1,600 cycles with their 150-watt charging phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">00:09:23</a>.

Modern smartphones are equipped with "smart" battery features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">00:10:24</a>:
*   **Internal Sensors:** Tons of hardware and sensors measure temperature and regulate charging automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">00:10:29</a>.
*   **Optimized Charging Software:** Features like those in the latest [[evolution_of_iphone_design_and_features | iPhones]] and Pixels learn user habits to optimize charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">00:11:02</a>. For example, if you plug in overnight, the phone might charge to 80% and pause, then complete the charge to 100% just before your typical wake-up time, minimizing stress on the battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">00:11:06</a>.
*   **Pass-Through Charging:** Gaming phones like the ROG Phone 5 can directly power the system when plugged in, bypassing the battery completely during intense usage to avoid adding stress and heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">00:10:45</a>.

Ultimately, while trade-offs like thicker phones, larger bricks, or slightly smaller [[battery_life_and_charging_capabilities | battery capacity]] exist, fast charging does not inherently ruin a phone's battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">00:09:41</a>. The primary factor in battery degradation remains heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">00:04:09</a>. Avoiding conditions that cause the phone to get excessively hot, such as leaving it in a hot car or prolonged gaming while charging, is the best way to maintain [[battery_life_and_charging | battery health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">00:11:52</a>.

> [!NOTE] Galaxy Note 7 Incident
> The infamous battery issues with the Galaxy Note 7 were not due to fast charging or overheating. Instead, they stemmed from a manufacturing defect where incorrect dimensions caused the battery to bend, leading to issues with the positive and negative sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">00:12:15</a>.

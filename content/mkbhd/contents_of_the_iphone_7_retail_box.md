The [[iphone_7_unboxing_experience | unboxing experience]] for the iPhone 7 is described as the standard retail box experience that customers receive upon purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Box Appearance
The color of the iPhone 7 retail box varies depending on the phone's finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Jet Black iPhone:** If you buy a jet black iPhone, you will receive a rare black Apple box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Box Contents

Upon opening the box, the first item found is typically not the phone itself, but rather paperwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **Paperwork:** A packet labeled "Design by Apple in California" is located at the top of the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This is consistent across both the jet black and matte black versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **iPhone:** Beneath the paperwork, the iPhone 7 is found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
    *   The jet black iPhone is presented in its glossy finish with a plastic screen protector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. It is noted that this is likely the most fingerprint-free state the phone will ever be in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
    *   The matte black iPhone also appears super clean upon unboxing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. While it will show fingerprints, it won't be to the same extent as the super glossy jet black model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

Inside the box, alongside the phone, you will find:
*   **EarPods:** These are Lightning-attached earbuds, not AirPods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. They feature a Lightning connector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Lightning to 3.5mm Headphone Jack Adapter (Dongle):** This adapter allows for connection of traditional 3.5mm headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. If this adapter is lost, a replacement costs nine dollars and can be purchased from the Apple Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Lightning Cable:** A Lightning cable is included for connecting the iPhone to a computer or iTunes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Wall Adapter:** A standard wall adapter is provided for charging the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

> [!TIP] Choosing a Color
> If you are having trouble deciding between the jet black and matte black iPhone 7, the matte black is suggested as the "safe route" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. The jet black is considered almost a "special edition phone" and is known to show fingerprints and scratches more readily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. It's recommended to see the jet black in person at a store before deciding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

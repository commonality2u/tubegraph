Following the initial unveiling of the [[tesla_cybertruck_design_and_unveiling | Tesla CyberTruck]], several questions and details remain unconfirmed or unclear, even after the presentation and initial test rides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.

## Unanswered Questions

During the event and subsequent observations, some key aspects of the CyberTruck were not fully detailed:
*   **Release Date** There was no specific release date provided for the CyberTruck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>, despite people being able to pre-order and reserve them immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.
*   **Windshield Wipers** The location or design of the windshield wipers was not clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.
*   **Sideview Mirrors** The presence or design of traditional sideview mirrors was an unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.
*   **Bed Material** The material of the truck bed itself was not specified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.
*   **ATV Availability** An ATV was showcased fitting and charging in the back of the CyberTruck during the event, but it's unclear if this ATV will be sold by Tesla, its price, or if it will be offered as an option with the CyberTruck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.
*   **Interior Finalization** The interior, especially the touchscreen graphics, appeared to be a "bare prototype feeling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>, and it's uncertain how final these elements are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

## Future Outlook

It is expected that further details about the CyberTruck will gradually emerge as it gets closer to production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. The initial unveiling served as a significant hype event to generate public discussion and interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. There is now a "big wait" for more information and the eventual release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

## Public Reception

The [[tesla_cybertruck_design_and_features | CyberTruck's design]] is highly polarizing, described as one of the most unconventional automotive designs seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>. People tend to either "really like it or really hate it," with little middle ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. Its appearance has been compared to a "low poly count render" from a video game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a> and evokes a "Mars rover type of stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.

Apple introduced the [[AirPods Max Design and Build Quality | AirPods Max]], a new pair of over-ear wireless noise-cancelling headphones, as a "quiet but not so quiet" addition to their holiday season lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. They retail for $550 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Naming and Initial Reaction
The name "AirPods Max" was initially perplexing, though it aligns with Apple's other audio products like EarPods, [[AirPods Pro design and features | AirPods]], and HomePods, which all include "pod" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## [[AirPods Max Packaging and Accessories | Unboxing and First Look]]
The [[AirPods Max Packaging and Accessories | AirPods Max]] come in a "pretty big box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Upon opening, the headphones are found pre-inserted into their Smart Case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The metal of the headphones is notably cold to the touch right out of the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

The box includes some paperwork and a single USB-C to Lightning cable for charging, but no power brick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Notably, an audio cable is not included and must be purchased separately from Apple for an additional $35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

The headphones themselves have a unique design, reminiscent of modernized planar magnetic headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Key First Impressions
This initial overview highlights five significant aspects of the new [[AirPods Max Design and Build Quality | AirPods Max]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>:

### 1. [[Design and build quality of AirPods Max | Materials and Build Quality]]
The [[design_and_build_quality_of_airpods_max | AirPods Max]] feature a flexible stainless steel frame and aluminum ear cups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. They have shiny telescoping arms and ball-head joints that allow the ear cups to move over 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. The build quality is excellent with "no creaks, no gaps anywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, and the slide mechanism for expansion offers satisfying resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

For comfort, a mesh band at the top is designed to distribute weight evenly and be breathable, feeling "really soft" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Due to the all-metal construction, these are heavy headphones, weighing 386 grams, significantly more than the Sony XM4s (250 grams) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. A notable omission is their lack of sweat or water resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

The available color options mirror those of the iPad Air: black, silver, light blue, pink, and minty green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### 2. Ear Cups
The ear cups are magnetic, allowing them to pop off easily while remaining securely in place during wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This design choice is practical as ear cups often wear out over time, and this allows for easy replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. New ear pads are available from Apple for $60 a set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, and users can mix and match colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

### 3. Controls
Unlike many wireless headphones, the [[AirPods Max Design and Build Quality | AirPods Max]] do not feature touch controls on the ear cups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Instead, they incorporate the Digital Crown from the Apple Watch for volume control, answering calls, and track navigation (double-tap for forward, triple-tap for back) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. An additional button is present for toggling between transparency and noise cancellation modes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. The physical controls are preferred over "finicky touch controls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. iOS 14.3 also adds support to reverse the scrolling direction for the crown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### 4. The Smart Case
The Smart Case, included with the headphones, has a polarizing design, drawing comparisons to a "purse" or a "bra" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

The caseâ€™s functionality is also peculiar:
*   The headphones do not fold down for travel, relying on the case for portability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   The most durable part of the headphones (the metal) is covered, while the softest, least durable part (the mesh band) serves as the carrying strap and is exposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   The case is not fully protective, with "slots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

The case's primary function is to manage battery life, as there is no physical on/off button on the headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. Placing the headphones in the Smart Case and closing the magnetic flap activates an "ultra-low power state" to conserve battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. When removed, they wake up instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Without the case, the headphones will drain battery for about two hours before entering a low-power mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### 5. [[AirPods Max Features and Smart Capabilities | Smart Features and Sound Quality]]
The [[airpods_max_features_and_smart_capabilities | AirPods Max]] incorporate dual H1 chips (one in each ear) for computing as music is listened to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. They also feature nine microphones for noise cancellation and transparency mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

As Apple headphones, they are designed to integrate seamlessly with iPhones and other Apple products, offering features like audio sharing, Siri, text message reading, and instant pairing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

Initial impressions on sound quality are "very good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, and noise cancellation is "right about on par with [[AirPods Pro sound quality | AirPods Pro]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, being "incredibly good with white noise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

## [[AirPods Max Price Comparison with Other Headphones | Price and Comparison Challenges]]
At $550, the [[AirPods Max Price Comparison with Other Headphones | AirPods Max]] present a challenge for comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. When compared to the Sony XM4s, a popular industry favorite for noise-cancelling wireless headphones, the XM4s offer:
*   "Absolute best noise cancellation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>
*   Lighter weight and comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>
*   Longer 30-hour battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>
*   Foldable design for travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>
*   A "real protective case" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>
*   Included audio cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>
*   A price of $350 or less, which is $200 cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>

On paper, the Sony headphones appear to outperform the [[AirPods Max Design and Build Quality | AirPods Max]] in "pretty much every metric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

However, the comparison might be more akin to Apple's Pro Display XDR, which is appreciated when compared to "super ultra high end reference grade stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. This suggests the [[AirPods Max Design and Build Quality | AirPods Max]] could be seen as a "lighter weight, wireless, smaller, cheaper version" of high-end headphones like 2400-dollar Sennheiser models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, or an entry into the "high-end audiophile range" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

## Conclusion on First Impressions
After initial listening, the [[AirPods Max Design and Build Quality | AirPods Max]] sound "really good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>, but whether they sound "$550 good" is still to be determined, as they are "starting to approach the limits of wireless audio" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. They are "built extremely well," but this alone may not justify the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. While they offer all of [[Apples new AirPods and AirPods Pro features | Apple's smart features]], this feature set alone may not be enough to warrant such an expensive purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. Despite these considerations, the headphones were already sold out upon initial release, suggesting a strong audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

[[iOS 14 home screen customization levels | iOS 14]] introduced significant changes to the iOS home screen, marking the biggest overhaul in its history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. These updates address long-standing requests, bringing new levels of organization and customization.

## App Library

The App Library is a new space located at the far right of all home screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. It functions as a comprehensive list of all installed apps, automatically organized into categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This feature provides iOS with its first true app drawer, centralizing all applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Within the App Library, users can find an alphabetical, searchable list of apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. While the pull-down search function for apps remains available from anywhere on the home screen, the App Library aims to reduce the need for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Widgets

After years of anticipation, [[using_widgets_on_ios_14 | widgets]] are finally available on the iOS home screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
While still more restricted than Android's widget implementation, they offer new flexibility:
*   **Placement** Widgets can be added to any home screen by long-pressing the screen and tapping the plus button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, but they must align to the left or right side of the screen and cannot be placed freely in the middle or standalone on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Sizes** Various sizes are available for widgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **App Support** Initially, all widgets are from first-party Apple apps, but third-party support is expected to be integrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Smart Stacks

Building on the fundamental widget functionality, Apple introduced dynamic features like the Smart Stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>:
*   **Functionality** A Smart Stack is a carousel of several common widgets that can be scrolled through manually or configured to change automatically based on predictive behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Customization** Users can edit Smart Stacks to remove unwanted widgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Creation** Users can create their own Smart Stacks by dragging and dropping two widgets of the same size on top of each other, forming a scrollable stack. More widgets can be added to this stack, which can then be optionally converted into a Smart Stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Hiding Home Screens

With the introduction of the App Library, iOS 14 allows users to hide entire home screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This is useful for managing apps that are not frequently used but should not be deleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Instead of creating random folders, users can hide pages by long-pressing to edit, tapping the dots at the bottom, and unchecking the desired pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This enables setups where an iOS home screen could consist of no apps, only a single page of widgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

Overall, these home screen updates represent the most significant changes in [[ios_18_home_screen_customization | iOS 14 home screen customization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

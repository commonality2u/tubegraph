The [[Dynamic Island feature | Dynamic Island]] is a notable new feature introduced with the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max, transforming the notch area into an interactive software element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.

## [[Design and Features | Design]] and Concept
Previously, rumors suggested an "i-shaped" cutout for the iPhone 14 Pro's notch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. This is what the [[Dynamic Island feature | Dynamic Island]] essentially is: it features one circular cutout on the right for the new selfie camera and a pill-shaped cutout on the left for the Face ID hardware, which has been shrunk by approximately 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>. Apple cleverly fills the gap between these two cutouts with black pixels, making it appear as one large pill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. The intention is for users to perceive this pill as software rather than hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.

## Functionality and Interactions
The [[Dynamic Island feature | Dynamic Island]] acts as a dynamic area that indicates ongoing and background activities, beautifully animated and super smooth with fluid physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>. It shows up in screenshots and screen recordings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.

### Out-of-the-Box Compatibility
A significant advantage is its immediate compatibility with most applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. Apps like Spotify, SoundCloud, YouTube Music, and Pocket Casts, which already use "Now Playing" APIs, integrate seamlessly, displaying album art and color-matching waveforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>.

### System Alerts and Live Activities
The [[Dynamic Island feature | Dynamic Island]] displays various system alerts and live activities:
*   **System Alerts**: Incoming calls, connecting AirPods, plugging into a charger, switching ringer modes, volume changes, and Face ID unlocking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>.
*   **Live Activities**: Ongoing calls, background music or media playback, timers, Maps directions, voice memos recording, and screen recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>.
*   It also features an indicator for microphone and camera access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>.

### Multitasking Capabilities
When multiple background activities are occurring, the [[Dynamic Island feature | Dynamic Island]] can split into two sections, allowing users to quickly swap between them with a single touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>. This effectively turns it into a multitasking app switcher at the top of the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>.

### User Interaction
*   **Tap**: Tapping the [[Dynamic Island feature | Dynamic Island]] opens the app that is currently active within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.
*   **Long Press**: Long-pressing the [[Dynamic Island feature | Dynamic Island]] reveals a widget with controls, such as media controls allowing scrubbing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>.

## Technical Aspects
The smooth animations and fluidity of the [[Dynamic Island feature | Dynamic Island]] are powered by a new display engine within the A16 Bionic chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>. It exhibits physical properties, wobbling when poked, giving it a "living" feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>. The areas around the physical cutouts for the camera and Face ID system are touch-sensitive to register taps even on "dead zones" of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>.

## Significance and Outlook
While some find the name "[[Dynamic Island feature | Dynamic Island]]" to be cheesy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>, it is considered a well-executed feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>. It is predicted to be one of the most copied features in the smartphone world within 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>. Despite its apparent simplicity, replicating it precisely at Apple's level will be challenging due to the underlying technical complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>.

Although it's not a game-changing feature for most users or a primary reason to choose the iPhone 14 Pro over another phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>, it is a "nice quality of life touch" that many people will appreciate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>. This concept of a secondary, interactive display area was technically invented by LG seven years prior with the top screen on the LG V10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:00">[13:23:00]</a>.

When selecting a new iPhone, several key factors should influence your decision, including budget, desired display quality, device size, and camera capabilities. The iPhone 11 is highlighted as a strong recommendation for most users, but other models offer different trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## iPhone 11 Overview

The iPhone 11 represents a significant improvement over the [[comparison_between_iphone_xr_and_iphone_xs | iPhone 10R]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> and is generally cheaper than the Pro models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. It shares many design elements with its predecessors like the [[comparison_between_iphone_xr_and_iphone_xs | 10R]], 10S, and 10, including the same shape, notch, size, mute switch, speakers, aluminum rails, and Lightning port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. It maintains the same 8.3 millimeters thickness and 194 grams weight as the [[comparison_between_iphone_xr_and_iphone_xs | 10R]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

A notable change is the simplified naming convention, dropping the Roman numerals from previous models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The iPhone 11 is available in six new pastel colors: black, green, yellow, purple, red, and white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Its back features two different glass finishes: glossy where the Apple logo is (now centered) and a matte finish for the camera square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. These finishes are cut from a single piece of milled glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Key Decision Factors

### 1. Budget and Price

The iPhone 11 starts at $700 for the 64GB model, fitting neatly into Apple's current iPhone price gradient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **iPhone 11**: Starts at $700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **[[comparison_between_iphone_xr_and_iphone_xs | iPhone 10R]]**: Still sold at a cheaper price (around $600) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **[[differences_between_iphone_x_and_iphone_8 | iPhone 8]]**: Available for even less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **iPhone 11 Pro**: Costs more than the iPhone 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, starting at $1000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### 2. Display Quality

The iPhone 11 utilizes an LCD display with a 1792x828 resolution, which means it cannot watch HD YouTube videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The YouTube app may falsely indicate 1080p playback, but the actual resolution is just over 720p <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   If you value a sharp, high-resolution display and notice the difference, consider higher-resolution OLED iPhones like the iPhone 10S or iPhone 11 Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

### 3. Device Size

The iPhone 11 is considered a "pretty big phone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, with a 6.1-inch screen size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   If the 6.1-inch size of the iPhone 11 or [[comparison_between_iphone_xr_and_iphone_xs | 10R]] is too large, the iPhone 11 Pro offers a slightly smaller size with a better display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   If you prefer an even larger phone, the iPhone 11 Pro Max is an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

### 4. Camera Capabilities

The cameras are the biggest new feature for the iPhone 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **New Main Camera**: Improved primary camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Ultra-Wide Camera**: A new second camera, enabling features like switching lenses during 4K video recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Improved Portrait Mode**: Now works with animals, objects, and other things beyond just human faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Wider Front-Facing Camera**: Capable of slow-motion selfie videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Missing Telephoto**: The iPhone 11 lacks the third telephoto camera found on the iPhone 11 Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **Quality**: Both included cameras are considered "A-plus smartphone cameras in 2019" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a> and arguably the best in a $700 smartphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### 5. Battery Life

The iPhone 11 offers battery life at least equivalent to, if not one hour longer than, the [[comparison_between_iphone_xr_and_iphone_xs | iPhone 10R]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The [[comparison_between_iphone_xr_and_iphone_xs | iPhone 10R]] was known for having some of the best battery life among iPhones in a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Recommendation

The iPhone 11 is generally the recommended choice for most people buying a new iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. It offers solid improvements, particularly in its camera system, and a price drop compared to its Pro counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. However, if display quality or a more compact size are paramount, the iPhone 11 Pro might be worth the additional cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. For those on a stricter budget who don't prioritize the enhanced camera features, the [[comparison_between_iphone_xr_and_iphone_xs | iPhone 10R]] or [[differences_between_iphone_x_and_iphone_8 | iPhone 8]] remain competitive options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

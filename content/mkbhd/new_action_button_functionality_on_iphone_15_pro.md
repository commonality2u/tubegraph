The [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | iPhone 15 Pro]] and [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | iPhone 15 Pro Max]] introduce a new Action button, replacing the traditional mute switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Initial observations suggest that this button offers extensive customization without apparent restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, making it a valuable addition to the [[iphone_15_pro_advanced_features | advanced features]] of the [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | iPhone 15 Pro]].

## Customization and User Interface
Users can customize the Action button's functionality by navigating to its dedicated settings page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This specific UI within the iPhone's settings allows for programming various actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## Default and Pre-programmed Functions
By default, the Action button maintains its role as a mute switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. It provides distinct haptic patterns to confirm whether the phone has been muted or unmuted, even when in a pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

Other pre-programmed options include:
*   **Camera** The button can open the camera in any available mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. However, the camera shortcut is already readily available on the lock screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   **Flashlight** Similar to the camera, the flashlight can be activated, though it's also a lock screen option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   **Voice Memo** This is noted as a convenient option, as pressing and holding the button immediately begins recording a voice memo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

## Siri Shortcuts Integration
The most versatile function for the Action button is its integration with Siri Shortcuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This allows users to execute a wide range of custom actions, such as:
*   Triggering location-dependent functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>
*   Calling specific contacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>
*   Opening any app on the phone with virtually no lag, including to-do list apps, calendar apps, or streaming services like YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>

The speaker personally intends to map their Action button to the Google Assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

## Desired Future Functionality
A suggested improvement for the Action button is the ability to map double-press or triple-press actions to specific functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

## Compatibility with Cases
The Action button's functionality and clicky feel are maintained even when using a case, such as the dbrand Ghost case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

The 2021 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros represent a significant leap in design and performance, making them "next level" tools for professionals, particularly those working with video [01:08:10]. The enhancements are evident both internally and externally [01:36:00].

## Exterior Design
The new MacBook Pros feature a "top-notch design" that retains the MacBook Pro aesthetic but with welcomed changes [01:43:00]. The entire shape is more squared off, reminiscent of older aluminum PowerBooks, but modernized [01:49:00]. These laptops are noticeably thicker, which is acceptable due to its benefits [01:56:00]. They also stand slightly higher on taller feet, providing more room for back and side vents, improving ventilation, though the fans are rarely audible [02:03:00]. The Apple logo on the back is slightly larger, and "MacBook Pro" text is now carved into the bottom [02:14:00].

## Ports
A notable return for the MacBook Pro line is the inclusion of "real ports" [02:25:00]. Apple has walked back from previous designs that lacked these essential connections, much to the satisfaction of users [02:30:00].

### Right Side Ports
On the right side, the MacBook Pro features:
*   A full-size HDMI port [02:43:00].
*   One Thunderbolt 4 port [02:47:00].
*   A full-size, half-depth SD card slot, which is particularly useful for audio and video professionals [02:49:00].

### Left Side Ports
The left side provides:
*   Two additional Thunderbolt 4 ports [03:04:00].
*   A headphone jack [03:06:00].
*   The return of the magnetic MagSafe charging port [03:08:00].

### MagSafe and Charging
The MagSafe port has been redesigned to be thinner and stronger, requiring more lateral force to detach, yet still feeling "mag safe" compared to a straight USB-C connection [03:14:00]. The 14-inch MacBook Pro comes with a 96-watt power adapter, an upgrade from the 67-watt base model, while the 16-inch model includes a large 140-watt rectangular charging brick [03:35:00]. The brick is separate from the braided USB-C cable, which has a MagSafe connector on the end [03:51:00].
Fast charging is supported via MagSafe, achieving approximately 50% charge in half an hour [04:07:00]. Users can also charge via USB-C, though at a slightly slower 96 watts [04:15:00]. A minor aesthetic point is the lack of a space gray MagSafe connector for space gray laptops [03:57:00].

### Headphone Jack
The headphone jack now supports high-impedance headphones, a feature mentioned during Apple's presentation [04:27:00]. High-impedance headphones typically require more power for adequate volume, with impedances well over 100 ohms, compared to 20-50 ohms for standard wired headphones like Beats or ATH-M50s [04:40:00]. This improvement means professionals using such headphones might no longer need to carry an external Thunderbolt DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) [05:07:00]. The preamps are powerful, allowing high-impedance headphones like the 250-ohm Beyerdynamic DT770 Pros to reach comfortable volume at 65% on the new MacBook Pros, compared to 100% on the M1 MacBook Pro [05:22:00]. While not superior to a dedicated amplifier, it offers convenience in a pinch [05:47:00].

### Port Limitations
Despite the return of ports, there are some limitations:
*   The HDMI port is HDMI 2.0, not 2.1 [06:01:00]. While it supports 4K 60Hz, it's considered an odd choice for an expensive computer not to include the latest standard [06:09:00].
*   The SD card slot is UHS-2, not supporting the newer, faster UHS-3 speeds [06:20:00]. However, UHS-2 still offers a respectable 300 megabytes per second [06:26:00].
These choices reflect a "convenient in a pinch" approach rather than offering the highest-end components [06:38:00]. The absence of an Ethernet port on the power brick, similar to the M1 iMac, is also noted as a missed opportunity for professional users [06:43:00].

## Keyboard
The new MacBook Pros feature an improved keyboard with physical keys, replacing the Touch Bar [07:15:00]. It includes a full row of full-height physical function keys at the top [07:23:00]. While the Touch Bar had niche uses, the physical buttons are generally preferred [07:39:00]. The keyboard is backlit, and the keys offer good feel and decent travel, comparable to Apple keyboards from five years prior [07:43:00]. The Touch ID button functions quickly and reliably [07:50:00]. A subtle but appreciated aesthetic touch is the keyboard's placement within a black anodized rectangle [07:54:00]. Black keys will show fingerprints and skin oils more readily than lighter keyboards [08:02:00].

## Speakers and Microphones
The speakers, especially on the 16-inch model, are described as "absolutely incredible" and the "biggest, fullest, best speakers" ever heard in a laptop [08:10:00]. The studio microphones are also improved [08:20:00].

## Display
The new displays are impressive both on paper and in real-world use [08:27:00]. They are 10-bit mini LED HDR panels with an almost 4K resolution and a 16:10 aspect ratio, featuring a high refresh rate [08:33:00]. Essentially, they are a Mini Pro Display XDR with higher pixel density and refresh rate [08:48:00]. While they don't always look dramatically different from previous MacBook Pros in everyday use, they can reach 1600 nits peak brightness when displaying HDR content [08:55:00]. Thinner bezels around the display were a much-anticipated improvement [09:05:00].

### ProMotion
The display features ProMotion, Apple's adaptive refresh rate technology [09:14:00]. While it doesn't always max out at 120Hz, even when navigating the UI, the higher refresh rate is noticeable in certain areas [09:18:00]. For instance, moving the mouse, large animations (like swiping between spaces or the genie effect for minimizing windows), and scrolling within a Final Cut Pro timeline exhibit noticeable smoothness [09:37:00]. Safari currently requires an update to fully support the adaptive frame rate [09:31:00].

### The Notch
The display introduces a notch at the top [08:43:00]. This notch houses the new 1080p webcam, an ambient light sensor, and an LED indicator [10:17:00]. Despite the relatively minimal hardware inside, the notch is considerably large, prompting questions about its necessity [10:31:00].
In practice, the notch is less noticeable during actual laptop use [10:45:00]. Apple appears to be establishing it as a part of their recognizable design language [10:48:00]. When using the laptop, the mouse cursor goes underneath the notch [11:11:00]. The software generally treats the screen as if the notch isn't there; screenshots and screen recordings still capture the full pixel area [11:14:00]. When content goes full screen, the menu bar turns black, effectively making the notch blend in and creating the appearance of a slightly thicker top bezel [11:24:00]. The mini LED's deep blacks ensure the notch never cuts into actual content; instead, it occupies "extra display" space where the menu bar is now located [11:33:00].
Some minor software quirks exist, such as app menu bar items running underneath the notch when too many are present, requiring future software updates for better management (e.g., scrollable menus or expansion buttons) [11:47:00]. While third-party apps exist to black out the top portion of the display to hide the notch, it generally disappears from view when focused on content [12:00:00]. The reviewer humorously states that if the next version of the laptop still has a notch this big without adding Face ID (similar to [[design_and_build_quality_of_the_iphone_15_pro | iPhones]]), he would wear socks and sandals like Linus [12:23:00].

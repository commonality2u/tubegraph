The Samsung Galaxy Fold marks an interesting development as the first foldable phone made available to the masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Positioned as a luxury device, it is priced significantly higher than other high-end Samsung flagships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Unboxing & First Impressions
The [[unboxing_experience_of_the_samsung_galaxy_fold | unboxing experience]] for the Samsung Galaxy Fold emphasizes a premium feel, presented in a "box within a box" setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The phone itself ships folded flat in a thin white box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

The initial setup process is largely identical to other Samsung phones, such as the [[samsung_galaxy_s9_overview_and_design | Galaxy S10]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Users can perform setup on either the front or inside screen, though the larger inside screen is preferred for typing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The device's default wallpaper features a smart black butterfly with pitch-black pixels around the edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Physical Design & Features
A notable design element of the Galaxy Fold is its strong magnetic closure, which produces a satisfying "flip" sound when closing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. There are two strong magnets located approximately two-thirds of the way down each side of the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. These magnets are powerful enough to create a magnetic field outside the phone and can pick up various metal objects, including washers, nails, keychains, small wrenches, Apple Pencils, and large Allen keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Included Accessories
The [[included_accessories_with_the_samsung_galaxy_fold | accessories]] provided with the Galaxy Fold reinforce its premium positioning and address its unique design:
*   **Two-piece Kevlar case:** This case is designed to be flexible and avoid the hinge, consisting of two separate pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. It includes adhesive on the inside, though it can be installed and removed without using it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

This is a significant inclusion, especially since the Galaxy Fold lacks a headphone jack, encouraging a wireless experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

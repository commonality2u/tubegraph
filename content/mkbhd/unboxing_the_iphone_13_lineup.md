The [[iphone_13_lineup_and_features | iPhone 13 lineup]] includes the standard iPhone 13, 13 mini, 13 Pro, and 13 Pro Max <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The unboxing experience for all models is largely similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Unboxing Experience

### Box Design and Environmental Impact
The boxes for the [[iphone_13_lineup_and_features | iPhone 13 lineup]] are thin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, primarily because a power brick is not included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. A notable change from previous models is the absence of plastic shrink wrap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Apple has shifted to using recycled materials, such as recycled box cardboard and recycled aluminum, to reduce their environmental impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

### Box Contents
The contents inside the boxes are largely consistent across the [[iphone_13_lineup_and_features | iPhone 13 lineup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Each box includes:
*   A Lightning to USBC cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>
*   Some paperwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>
*   A SIM card tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
*   A white Apple sticker (not colored) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>

### Specific Model Details
*   **iPhone 13 Standard**: Unboxed in a new blue color, which is considered a favorite among the new phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **iPhone 13 mini**: Features a new darker color called "Midnight," which is a very dark blue, almost black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The camera bump on this model may also appear close to black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **iPhone 13 Pro & Pro Max**: These models come in black boxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The 13 Pro was shown in gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, and the 13 Pro Max in Sierra Blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. They both feature a "big camera bump" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## First Impressions (After 5 Days of Testing)
After testing the [[iphone_13_lineup_and_features | new iPhones]] for five days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, several initial impressions stand out.

### Design and Weight
From the outside, the [[iphone_13_lineup_and_features | iPhone 13]] looks almost identical to the [[iphone_12_unboxing_experience | iPhone 12]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. While it feels almost the same in hand, it is about 0.4 millimeters thicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a> and approximately 20 grams heavier, a difference that is noticeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Battery Life
The increased weight primarily comes from a slightly larger battery capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This larger battery is considered an underrated new change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, with impressive performance, especially on the larger models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. For example, the 13 Pro had nearly 5 hours of screen-on time with half battery left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Cameras
The [[iphone_13_lineup_and_features | iPhone 13]] cameras are generally a "great set of cameras" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, particularly in broad daylight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Key improvements are expected in low light and with fast-moving subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. All sensors are larger and better, remaining at 12 megapixels each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. The Ultra Wide camera shows much better sharpness across the whole frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, and the new telephoto on the Pro models is 3x, improved from 2.5x on the previous Pro Max <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

The larger sensors contribute to the "massive" camera bumps on the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. The cameras on the 13 and 13 mini are now diagonally arranged, a change made to accommodate the new hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

#### Camera Quirks and Features
*   **ProRes Video**: This super high-quality codec, intended for the 13 Pro and Pro Max, was not available at launch and is a "coming soon" feature expected via a software update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Macro Capability**: The iPhone Pro models feature a new macro capability on their ultrawide lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. When close to an object (within ~14 cm), the cameras automatically switch to the ultrawide, allowing focus as close as 2 cm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This provides high-quality macro shots by cropping from a higher quality sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
    *   One quirk is that this automatic switch has no manual override <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. The viewfinder shows the switch but still indicates "1X" as if using the main camera, preventing manual return to the primary sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Cinematic Mode**: Available on all [[iphone_13_lineup_and_features | iPhone 13]] models, this software feature is processor-intensive, hence its exclusivity to the [[iphone_13_lineup_and_features | iPhone 13]] and later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Described as "focus racking" and AI-based face tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, it effectively functions as a "video portrait mode," applying fake depth of field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. It has its own dedicated swipe-over panel in the camera app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a> and includes more manual controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

### Screens
The screen sizes remain the same as the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, but they are brighter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

#### Notch and ProMotion
*   **Smaller Notch**: The notch is approximately 20% smaller due to the earpiece moving to the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. However, this change makes almost no difference in screen real estate and does not add options like battery percentage in the status bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   **120Hz ProMotion**: The Pro versions now feature 120Hz ProMotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. This feature is "legit" and significantly enhances the visual experience with super smooth animations across nearly every app and animation, even pre-launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. The OLED display combined with 120Hz HDR creates a "beautiful" experience, even surpassing the iPad Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

### Performance
The [[iphone_13_lineup_and_features | iPhone 13 lineup]] is powered by the A15 Bionic chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Initial Geekbench scores indicate it is a very fast chip, offering a slight performance bump over last year's model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Upgrade Recommendation
The [[iphone_13_lineup_and_features | iPhone 13]] is considered a minor update compared to the [[iphone_12_unboxing_experience | iPhone 12]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. If considering the standard 13, a discounted [[iphone_12_unboxing_experience | iPhone 12]] might be a viable alternative due to their similarities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. However, the 13 mini offers improved battery life compared to its predecessor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. For the Pro models, the 120Hz ProMotion display is a significant consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

For users with older phones, such as [[unboxing_experience_of_iphone_x | iPhone X]] or [[contents_of_the_iphone_7_retail_box | iPhone 8]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>, the [[iphone_13_lineup_and_features | iPhone 13 lineup]] represents a solid upgrade and a good purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

The [[apple_vision_pro_headset_unboxing | Apple Vision Pro]] headset includes several customizable elements designed to enhance user comfort and immersion, primarily through its Light Seal and various headbands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. These components are part of the [[components_and_accessories_of_apple_vision_pro | accessories]] that come with the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Custom-Fitted Light Seal

The Light Seal is crucial for blocking out external light and enhancing immersion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. To ensure a proper fit, users undergo a face-scanning process using an iPhone's Face ID sensors, which measure facial depth around the eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. This scan helps determine the best-matched Light Seal from a preset number of sizes and shapes, rather than being a custom molding for each individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The Light Seal attaches magnetically to the headset, similar to how AirPods Max headphone covers attach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### Light Seal Cushions

The Light Seal itself comes with two interchangeable cushions: one thin and one thick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. These cushions offer different levels of padding and can adjust how far the headset sits from the face, which can be particularly useful if using [[vision_pro_compatibility_with_glasses_and_zeiss_lenses | optical inserts]] or if the user simply desires more cushion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

## Interchangeable Bands

The [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | Vision Pro]] includes two different bands in the box, primarily to help distribute the headset's weight effectively, as the device is notably front-weighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. When measuring for the headset, users receive either a small, medium, or large size for their bands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Bands are easily removed and attached via an orange pull tab that unclicks the metal connection points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

### Solo Knit Band

This band is featured in most of the product's commercials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. It is made from a soft, stretchy fabric material and wraps around the back of the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. A crank mechanism on the side allows for tightening the band <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. While simple in appearance, the Solo Knit Band places most of the headset's weight on the front of the face, resting on the cheeks and forehead, which can become uncomfortable during extended use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

### Dual Loop Band

Designed for better weight distribution, the Dual Loop Band features two straps: one that goes around the back of the head and another that goes over the top of the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This band can be adjusted with Velcro, allowing users to customize its height and fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. It provides a more balanced and comfortable experience for longer wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

## Zeiss Optical Inserts

For users with a prescription or who wear glasses, [[vision_pro_compatibility_with_glasses_and_zeiss_lenses | Zeiss optical inserts]] are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. These lenses magnetically attach inside the headset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. They cost approximately $100 for readers and $150 for prescription lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. After attaching, the headset can scan a code on the lenses to recognize the prescription and adjust its display accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

The Tesla Cybertruck, after years as an enigma, is now nearing its final production form, revealing its capabilities and unique driving characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.

## Performance Specifications

The Cybertruck will be available in three configurations: a triple motor, a dual motor, and a single motor rear-wheel-drive version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

### Triple Motor Version (The "Beast")
The triple motor variant is designed for [[high_performance_capabilities | high performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>:
*   **Acceleration:** Achieves 0 to 60 mph in 2.7 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
*   **Quarter Mile:** Completes a quarter mile in 11 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.
*   **Horsepower:** Boasts approximately 845 horsepower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
*   **Torque Vectoring:** Features torque vectoring at the rear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
*   **Production Record:** This makes it potentially the fastest production pickup truck ever made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

### Dual Motor Version
The dual motor version also offers substantial [[high_performance_capabilities | performance]], with over 600 horsepower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.

### Range and Capacity
*   **Max Range:** The most efficient version of the truck offers a maximum range of about 340 miles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.
*   **Extended Range:** An optional add-on battery can be placed in the bed, adding 120 miles of range, bringing the total to between 400 and 450 miles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. This additional battery adds significant weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.
*   **Bed Capacity:** The bed has a capacity of 2,500 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.
*   **Towing Capacity:** Official towing capacity numbers were provided by Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

## Driving Dynamics

The Cybertruck introduces several innovations that significantly impact its driving experience, distinguishing it from traditional trucks like the [[performance_and_capabilities_of_the_ford_f150_lightning | F-150 Lightning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

### Steering System
The Cybertruck features a steer-by-wire system, a first for Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.
*   **Fixed Ratio:** The steering ratio remains constant and cannot be adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.
*   **Rear Axle Steering:** A key [[design_and_features | design feature]] is the active rear axle steering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.
    *   At speeds under 40 mph, the rear wheels can turn up to 10 degrees in the opposite direction of the front wheels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. This effectively shortens the wheelbase, allowing for much tighter turns and enhanced nimbleness in scenarios like parking lots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
    *   At speeds above 40 mph, the rear wheels turn 1-2 degrees in the same direction as the front wheels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>, which effectively lengthens the wheelbase for greater stability during highway lane changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.
*   **Total Turn Radius:** The total steering turn is less than 180 degrees for a maximum tight turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>, meaning only half a turn of the wheel is needed for full lock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. This requires significant adjustment for drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

### Suspension and Ride
*   **Adjustable Ride Height:** The truck features a fast-adjusting suspension with about 12 inches of travel between its lowest (entry) and highest (off-road) modes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. It can reach up to 17 inches of clearance in off-road mode, with an "Extract mode" adding another 80 millimeters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.
*   **Body Rigidity:** The stainless steel body contributes to a very stiff and torsionally rigid structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. This rigidity allows the advanced suspension system to manage comfort and firmness effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
*   **Ride Comfort:** While the suspension can be firm, there's a significant difference between the firmest and softest settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

### Architectural Features
*   **800-volt Architecture:** The Cybertruck utilizes an 800-volt architecture, allowing for faster charging at V4 Superchargers and thinner, more efficient wiring throughout the vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
*   **48-volt Low Voltage System:** It also incorporates a 48-volt low voltage system, four times the standard 12 volts found in most cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. These features contribute to the vehicle feeling "future-proof" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

## Driving Experience

The overall driving experience is akin to a Tesla, with instant throttle response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>, but with unique truck-specific characteristics.

### Interior and Visibility
*   **Quiet Cabin:** Laminated windows contribute to a quiet cabin, effectively sealing out most road noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. However, all-terrain tires still allow some road noise and feel to enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   **Forward Visibility:** The very short nose of the truck makes it difficult to see the front of the vehicle, requiring drivers to adapt to a different visual ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.
*   **Rear Visibility:** When the powered tonneau cover is closed, the rear visibility through the mirror is completely blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. Drivers must rely on the real-time rear-facing [[camera_performance_and_features | camera feed]] displayed on the main screen, which can be positioned on either side of the display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

### Overall Impressions
The Cybertruck "feels nimble" despite its size, largely due to the responsive steering and rear-wheel steer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. Its responsiveness on the highway is particularly notable, feeling more agile than even a Model S Plaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

The sheer power and responsiveness, combined with the innovative steering system, are considered its greatest strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. However, the high price point and polarizing [[vehicle_design_and_aesthetics | aesthetic design]] are identified as potential [[performance_and_limitations | downsides]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. The truck's [[innovative_features_like_the_front_trunk_and_bidirectional_power | features like onboard power]] and [[unique_features_and_challenges_like_the_case_and_price | alleged bulletproof capabilities]] further contribute to its unique appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

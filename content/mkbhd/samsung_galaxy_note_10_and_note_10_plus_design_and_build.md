The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10 Plus represent Samsung's latest flagship designs, described as premium devices built with metal and glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

### Overall Design

The new design of the Galaxy Note 10 series leans into a boxy look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. The display extends right up to the edges, featuring almost no top or bottom bezel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. The screen incorporates a curve on both sides, contributing to a feeling of being almost entirely screen and super immersive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. The corners are minimally rounded, getting "crazy close" to the edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. Despite a personal preference for flat screens, the design is noted as nice, and the phones look and feel good in the hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

### Display Integration

The selfie camera is positioned in the middle of the top of the phone, utilizing an [[samsung_galaxy_note_10_and_note_10_plus_display_specifications | Infinity-O cutout]] hole-punch design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. This cutout is a smaller area compared to its placement in the corner of the [[samsung_galaxy_s10_models_overview | S10]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. Samsung does not attempt to hide the cutout with gradient wallpapers, instead embracing it with a bright default wallpaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

### Colors and Finish

A new set of colors has been introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>, including a "crazy psychedelic rainbow sheen" called Aura Glow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. While visually striking due to the variety of colors it displays, the Aura Glow finish is a fingerprint magnet and may benefit from a skin or case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

### Fingerprint Reader

The fingerprint reader has been quietly moved underneath the display glass, aligning with the design of the [[samsung_galaxy_s10_models_overview | Galaxy S10]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

### Physical Features and Notable Changes

*   **No Headphone Jack**: The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 series marks the first time a Samsung flagship phone has omitted the headphone jack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. Samsung attributes this decision to space requirements for a larger battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. The phones will include USB-C earbuds in the box, but no dongle for traditional headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
*   **Button Layout**: The power button on the Note 10 now doubles as the Bixby button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. Both this combined button and the volume rockers are located on the left side of the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>, leaving the entire right side clean and blank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. A quick tap of the power button wakes or sleeps the device, but holding it activates Bixby, and it does not directly turn off the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. To power off the phone, users must access a new button within the notification drop-down menu, next to the Settings button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. It is hoped that this button is remappable or can be disabled in settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

### Differences Between Models

While both phones share a similar design language, the [[differences_between_note_10_and_note_10_plus | Note 10 Plus]] offers several distinct design and build advantages:
*   **Size**: The Note 10 Plus is larger, featuring a 6.8-inch 1440p AMOLED display, compared to the Note 10's 6.3-inch 1080p AMOLED display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.
*   **Colors**: While there are three standard colors for both models, the Note 10 Plus has an exclusive fourth "fancy blue" color option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.
*   **Camera Module**: Both feature triple cameras, but the Note 10 Plus includes additional depth sensors alongside its three cameras and flash, whereas the Note 10 only has the three cameras and flash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>.
*   **Storage Expansion**: Only the Note 10 Plus features a microSD card expansion slot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>.

The build quality is considered awesome and premium for both devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.

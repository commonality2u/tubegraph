The Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus represent an iteration of Samsung's mobile philosophy, offering a refined yet familiar [[user_interface_and_user_experience | user experience]] for those accustomed to their devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The phone is described as a "nearly perfect Samsung phone," meaning it embodies the best aspects of Samsung's approach to [[design_and_features | design and features]], [[software_and_ai_capabilities | software]], and cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## General User Experience and Design Refinements
The Galaxy S9 maintains the "Infinity Display" found in its predecessor, the S8, featuring one of the best displays in any smartphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Noteworthy improvements enhance the overall [[user_interface_and_user_experience | user experience]]:
*   **Bezels and Sensors** The top and bottom bezels are slightly thinner, and sensors are better hidden, contributing to a more seamless black appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Stereo Speakers** The earpiece now functions as a second front-facing speaker, providing a louder and clearer stereo audio experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This prevents completely missing audio if the bottom speaker is accidentally blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Fingerprint Reader** The most significant external change is the repositioning of the fingerprint reader to the middle, instead of next to the camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This new placement is deemed "perfect," being slightly raised for easier tactile location without looking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Fingerprint registration is also streamlined, requiring only a single slow swipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## Software and Performance
The Galaxy S9 runs on a Snapdragon 845 processor with either 4 or 6 GB of RAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **Smoothness** It offers the smoothest [[user_interface_and_user_experience | user experience]] on a Samsung phone to date, nearly matching the smoothness of a Pixel 2 in general use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. However, minor performance hiccups can still occur, particularly when opening Bixby or certain Samsung apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Samsung's Software Skin** Samsung continues its tradition of a colorful, customized Android skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. While improved, this aesthetic won't appeal to users who already dislike Samsung's [[software_and_ai_capabilities | software]] approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. The phone includes numerous advanced [[design_and_features | features]] and customization options, such as edge shortcuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

### Biometric Features
The S9 incorporates advanced biometric security options:
*   **Iris Scanning** Carried over from the Note series, iris scanning is slower but more secure than standard facial recognition using the front camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Intelligent Scan** A new [[software_and_ai_capabilities | software]] feature that combines face scanning and iris scanning, automatically using the method that performs best given the light conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

### Bixby
Bixby, Samsung's voice assistant, remains a part of the [[software_and_ai_capabilities | software]] package, complete with its dedicated button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Usability** Despite being given another chance, Bixby's overall utility is limited; it often triggers accidentally and its informational cards are not consistently useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Advanced Commands** Bixby Voice can handle complex commands involving deep settings navigation and longer strings of instructions within the phone, which other assistants struggle with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### Samsung's Ecosystem Approach
The Galaxy S9 maintains Samsung's characteristic "half-hearted ecosystem push," evidenced by the inclusion of duplicate applications (e.g., two browsers, two smart assistants, two calendars, two messaging apps) out of the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. However, as it runs Android, users can remove unwanted pre-installed [[software_and_ai_capabilities | software]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Overall Assessment
The Samsung Galaxy S9 is lauded for its strong hardware suite, including an exceptional display, A-plus build quality, and a comprehensive set of [[design_and_features | features]] like stereo speakers, a headphone jack, and expandable storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. While the [[user_interface_and_user_experience | user experience]] is excellent in many aspects, it still carries some of the traditional Samsung drawbacks, such as duplicate apps, slower Android updates, and occasional [[software_and_ai_capabilities | software]] hiccups with Bixby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. It is a "jack of all trades" that masters its display and excels in many other areas, making it easy to recommend, especially for those who appreciate the Samsung approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

Both the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro feature large displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Google's rationale for not offering a smaller model is that many users seeking a more affordable phone still desire a large screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Pixel 6 Display
The standard [[Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro design and hardware | Pixel 6]] is equipped with a 6.4-inch display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This screen features a 90Hz refresh rate and 1080p resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. It is a flat panel with relatively small bezels and a central hole-punch cutout for the selfie camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. For its price point, it is considered a good screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## Pixel 6 Pro Display
The [[Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro design and hardware | Pixel 6 Pro]], positioned as Google's flagship, sports a larger 6.7-inch display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. It boasts a higher 1440p resolution and an adaptive refresh rate of up to 120Hz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. The display is noted for being super sharp and highly responsive, providing a pleasant user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Display Nitpicks for the Pixel 6 Pro
As a flagship device, the [[Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro design and hardware | Pixel 6 Pro]]'s display has some minor drawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>:
*   **Curved Edges** The curved edges, while contributing to smaller bezels, can cause the corners of the screen to appear darker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Color Shift** There is a noticeable color shift when viewing the screen off-axis, a characteristic not typically seen on more expensive flagship displays like those found on the [[Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra]] or [[iPhone 13 Pro screen improvements | iPhone 13 Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Fingerprint Reader Performance
Both [[Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro design and hardware | Pixel 6]] models feature an in-display fingerprint reader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This appears to be an optical sensor, which shines a light on the finger, rather than the newer ultrasonic sensors used by Samsung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. The sensor is described as being "kind of slow," often taking at least half a second to read a finger, which can become annoying over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. The review suggests a faster or better sensor could have been implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

YouTube Rewind began as an annual "celebration of the top stuff on YouTube" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, showcasing "the biggest creators, the best videos, the memes, everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> from the past year.

## Initial Concept (2011-2012)

The original vision for YouTube Rewind, shared by YouTubers, creators, and audiences, was a "big celebration of looking back at the biggest YouTubers, the biggest YouTube events" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This concept centered on "rewinding and looking back at what the biggest things on YouTube were" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

The first iteration, [[comparison_of_youtube_rewind_through_the_years | YouTube Rewind 2011]], was a simple two-minute video featuring Rebecca Black counting down the top 10 most viewed videos of the year, concluding with her song "Friday" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. It included a montage of popular moments, memes, and references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

By [[comparison_of_youtube_rewind_through_the_years | YouTube Rewind 2012]], creators were brought in to shoot new content rather than just using existing viral videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. The entire four-minute video was a Gangnam Style remix, featuring a manageable number of creators, making it easy for viewers to "catch everything" and "appreciate everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This period is considered by some to be "peak rewind as far as actual video style" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

## Evolution and Shift in Purpose (2013 onwards)

Over the years, YouTube expanded Rewind to include more YouTube moments, memes, and references, and being included became an "honor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. However, YouTube's perspective on Rewind began to change as the platform grew and focused on monetization through advertisers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### Focus on Advertisers

YouTube started viewing Rewind as a platform to "showcase all the best stuff that happens on YouTube for advertisers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Particularly in the era of "brand safety and post ad-pocalypse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, maintaining a strong [[youtubes_relationship_with_advertisers | relationship with advertisers]] became crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

This led to Rewind transforming into a presentation of "advertiser friendly things," featuring "super clean creators" and late-night show hosts, essentially becoming a "giant ad for YouTube" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This divergence between what the community wants and what YouTube produces has caused significant dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

Popular creators and significant moments, such as PewDiePie, Shane Dawson, and the KSI vs. Logan Paul fight, were omitted from [[criticism_of_youtube_rewind_2018 | YouTube Rewind 2018]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Conversely, figures like Will Smith, Trevor Noah, and John Oliver, who were not primarily YouTubers or significantly prominent on the platform in 2018, were included, presumably due to their appeal to advertisers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### Production Style Changes

The style of YouTube Rewind has also become a point of contention, described as "difficult" and "hard to watch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Since [[comparison_of_youtube_rewind_through_the_years | YouTube Rewind 2013]], the production has been handled by Portal A, a production company that serves YouTube as a client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

-   **[[comparison_of_youtube_rewind_through_the_years | YouTube Rewind 2013]]**: This six-minute video was the first attempt to do "a lot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. It featured a mash-up style with six songs and 56 creators, plus guests like Cookie Monster and Jimmy Kimmel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. This was likely the first year Rewind was used to engage advertisers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
-   **[[comparison_of_youtube_rewind_through_the_years | YouTube Rewind 2014]]**: The mash-up style continued with 95 creators and six songs, featuring fast motion and quick cuts to cram in more content, leading to "absolute chaos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
-   **[[comparison_of_youtube_rewind_through_the_years | YouTube Rewind 2017]]**: This video represented the "peak" of this chaotic style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. It was seven minutes long, filled with late-night talk-show hosts, traditional celebrities, and numerous creators, creating a "barrage of everything" that felt like "flying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

Despite intentions to reduce the number of creators from over 300 in 2017 to 100 in [[criticism_of_youtube_rewind_2018 | YouTube Rewind 2018]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, the resulting video was still perceived as a "chaotic barrage of clips" that was "really hard to watch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Even segments that involved a full day's shooting for creators were heavily condensed into just a few seconds, losing their original intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Creator Perspective on YouTube Rewind

From a [[creators_perspective_on_youtube_rewind | creator's perspective]], the problem with the mash-up style is that it attempts to include "hundreds of things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a> in an effort to please everyone, yet it clearly excludes significant, and sometimes controversial, aspects of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. The more elements included, the more obvious the exclusions become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

It is suggested that for future Rewind videos, YouTube should "embrace cutting stuff out" and hand-select only "a couple of things that really popped and represented YouTube that year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, returning to the concept that made earlier versions so successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

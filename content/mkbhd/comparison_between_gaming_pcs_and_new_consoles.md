With the release of new consoles like the [[PlayStation 5 performance and speed | PS5]] and Xbox Series X, the discussion about the differences between PC gaming and console gaming has re-emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. While new consoles show a significant generational leap, impressing users with their capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, the PC gaming community often asserts that "real power still comes from the real computer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## High-End PC Gaming Capabilities
To showcase the pinnacle of PC gaming performance, an exclusive look at the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 graphics card was presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This card is Nvidia's highest-end offering in their 3000 Series, described as "gigantic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. It is capable of feats that "no new console will even really be able to touch," specifically in the realm of [[8K gaming capabilities | 8K gaming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

While frame rate is considered paramount in gaming, high resolution is essential for maximizing detail and immersion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. An earlier attempt at [[8K gaming capabilities | 8K gaming]] three years prior required two cables from the computer to the monitor for stitching the image, and the performance was not optimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. By 2020, advancements allow for a single HDMI 2.1 cable to output [[8K gaming capabilities | 8K]] resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### PC Hardware Requirements for 8K Gaming
The specific PC setup used for demonstrating [[8K gaming capabilities | 8K gaming]] included:
*   **Graphics Card:** Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
*   **Monitor/TV:** An 88-inch 8K OLED TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
*   **CPU:** Intel Core i9-10900K (10 cores, 3.7 GHz base clock, turbo up to 5.3 GHz) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>
*   **RAM:** 32GB of fast HyperX Fury RAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>
*   **Motherboard:** MSI MPG Z490 Gaming motherboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>
*   **Storage:** 1TB Samsung NVMe SSD (970 Pro) for the boot drive, and another 2TB SSD for mass storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>
*   **Chassis:** Custom-built aluminum chassis with RGB lighting, a matte black exterior, and tinted glass side panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>

This system is considered "more than enough to be the right setup" for spectacular gaming at high refresh rates or high resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

## [[8K gaming capabilities | Gaming Performance in 8K Resolution]]
The PC setup was tested with games running at a resolution of 7680x4320 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

### Forza Horizon 4
In Forza Horizon 4, the game locked at 60 FPS in [[8K gaming capabilities | 8K]] with maximum settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The high resolution made details like leaves on the ground, trees, and the sky appear crisper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. The game's intricate details, such as every snowflake falling in winter or the reflections in water droplets on the car's screen and body, contribute to a highly immersive experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. The GPU did experience minor drops to around 50 FPS during intensely detailed scenes, where over 30 megapixels are pushed for every frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Pre-rendered cutscenes in the game appeared to switch down to 1440p or 1080p, with a clear visual shift back to [[8K gaming capabilities | 8K]] when active gameplay resumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

### Control Ultimate Edition
Control Ultimate Edition also ran in [[8K gaming capabilities | 8K]], initially showing around 52 FPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. However, when the "render resolution" (environmental rendering) was increased to 5K, the FPS dropped significantly to 21 FPS, indicating the GPU was being heavily taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Setting the render resolution to 4K resulted in approximately 36 FPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. To maintain a smoother experience, the render resolution needed to remain at 2K, demonstrating that even a high-end card is not "invincible" at handling all requests at the highest settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. Despite this, the game's high-quality textures, reflections, and character models still created an immersive experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

## Conclusion: PC vs. Console in 8K
The answer to whether one can game in [[8K gaming capabilities | 8K]] is "yes," especially with an RTX 3090, which can handle "pretty much any game in pretty much any resolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. However, the market for [[8K gaming capabilities | 8K]] gaming monitors is not yet mature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. While high-end [[8K gaming capabilities | 8K]] TVs exist (e.g., the LG 8K TV used, which costs thousands of dollars), there isn't a widespread need for [[8K gaming capabilities | 8K gaming]] in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

For those comparing PC gaming to consoles, it is clear that high-end PCs like the one demonstrated can achieve feats beyond current console capabilities. The setup was able to consistently deliver 60 FPS at [[8K gaming capabilities | 8K]], providing a "glorious" and "beautiful" experience that consoles officially cannot match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. The primary difference lies in the ability of top-tier PCs to push extreme resolutions like [[8K gaming capabilities | 8K]] with high frame rates, a feature not currently available on new consoles when comparing a 4K TV experience to the demonstrated [[8K gaming capabilities | 8K]] PC setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

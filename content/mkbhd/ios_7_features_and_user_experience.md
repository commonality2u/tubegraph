The iPhone 5s ships running [[iOS 7 new features including home button and iOS 10 | iOS 7]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## User Experience and Design
[[iOS 7 new features including home button and iOS 10 | iOS 7]] introduces a visual overhaul, described as a "layer of gloss" over the previous [[iOS 7 new features including home button and iOS 10 | iOS 6]] functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. While the reviewer generally likes the new look, especially in areas beyond the home screen icons, the core functionality remains largely unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

The operating system reflects a design philosophy of "you'll probably like it or learn to like it, but if you don't, too bad because you just can't change things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This means many elements, such as the new icons, keyboard, stock lockscreen, dialer, and stock applications, cannot be customized if a user dislikes them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

A significant point of frustration for the reviewer is the animation when unlocking the iPhone 5s. This animation takes a solid half-second before the home screen becomes responsive, which cannot be sped up or disabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Another issue is visual inconsistency: if an app isn't updated for [[iOS 7 new features including home button and iOS 10 | iOS 7]], it will use the old-style keyboard instead of Apple's new one, leading to fragmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

Despite these quirks, [[iOS 7 new features including home button and iOS 10 | iOS 7]] performance is snappy and on par with other flagship phones, even those with superior on-paper specifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. This is attributed to Apple's control over the entire experience, from hardware to software, and extensive optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. [[iOS 7 new features including home button and iOS 10 | iOS]] has historically not required extensive resources to run smoothly, multitask efficiently, or maintain battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## Key Features

### Battery Management
[[iOS 7 new features including home button and iOS 10 | iOS]] demonstrates excellent standby times, with the iPhone retaining nearly 100% battery overnight, significantly outperforming comparable Android devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. However, during active use, the battery life is not as good as other smartphones with larger batteries and is slightly worse than the iPhone 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. The 1570 mAh battery charges very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01">[00:03:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### Touch ID
Touch ID, the fingerprint sensor integrated into the home button, allows users to unlock their phone and authenticate iTunes purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. It works accurately most of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Up to ten fingers can be registered, and users have experimented with registering other body parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. A notable caveat is that the iTunes password must be re-entered after every phone restart before Touch ID can be used for app store purchases again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

### Camera Experience
The camera offers a strong balance of quality (rated around 8/10) and ease of use/control (also 8/10), making it a highly likable camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. It can be quickly opened by swiping up from a shortcut in the corner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

The camera is characterized by its speed in several aspects:
*   **Photo Capture** It's very fast to take photos and process shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **HDR** Taking HDR photos is quick, eliminating the need for a perfectly still subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Aperture** The wide aperture (F 2.0 or 2.2) is fast and excellent for low-light conditions, though it can result in slightly softer images compared to the iPhone 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **Video Modes** It supports high-speed video recording at 120 frames per second, which can be slowed down to 30 frames per second for smooth slow-motion effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

The camera's low-light capabilities are particularly praised, enabling it to "see in the dark" where many other camera phones fall short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. Photos are generally solid, with accurate and colorful renditions, and good detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Overall, the camera ranks among the best available in smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

## Other Aspects
For users of Google services like Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Calendar, most core functions are accessible through apps from the App Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

The [[iOS 7 new features including home button and iOS 10 | iOS]] experience, combined with Apple's new 64-bit chip architecture and control over the entire ecosystem, makes the device feel "future-proof" and reliable, consistently performing as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

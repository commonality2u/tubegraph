The newest version of iOS, iOS 16, was revealed by Apple about a month before its release, bringing significant changes to iPhones 8 and later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Among its top features, the redesigned lock screen stands out as the most visually obvious and customizable change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:06">[06:28:06]</a>.

## Enhanced Lock Screen Customization
The iOS 16 lock screen introduces a new clock font, matching colors, and the ability to add widgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.

To customize the lock screen:
1.  Hold down on the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.
2.  Tap the "Customize" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>.
3.  Tap elements you wish to modify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.

Users can adjust the clock's font and color to ensure proper contrast and readability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.

### Widgets
iOS 16 allows users to add widgets both above and below the clock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.
*   **Below the clock:** These widgets function similarly to Apple Watch complications, providing small, glanceable pieces of information that open their associated app upon selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.
*   **Above the clock:** These are primarily text-based, suitable for displaying information like calendar events or weather details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.

### Multiple Lock Screens
Users can save multiple customized lock screen layouts and switch between them at any time, much like changing [[vision_pro_light_seal_and_band_customizations | Apple Watch faces]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>.

### Depth Effect
A notable feature is the "depth effect" where the clock can "nestle" itself between the foreground subject and the background of the wallpaper, provided no widgets are added below the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. This feature uses Apple's impressive object recognition from the Live Objects feature and works with any photo, not just portrait mode photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>. When unlocking, the foreground fades in before the background, adding a polished animation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>.

### Integration with Focus Modes
Customized lock screens can be associated with [[focus_modes_and_notification_enhancements_in_ios_15 | Focus modes]], allowing users to have different lock screens (and home screens) automatically switch based on their activities, such as work, sleep, or gym <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.

## Notification Enhancements
With the lock screen becoming more visually appealing, notifications have been re-engineered to roll in from the bottom of the screen, preventing them from obscuring the lock screen "masterpiece" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>. This design also improves reachability on all screen sizes and provides a more chronological flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.

Users can choose how notifications are displayed:
*   As a stack (more compact) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>
*   As a list (the traditional display) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>
*   As a count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>

### Live Activities
A new feature called Live Activities allows apps to update their notifications live with new information, rather than sending multiple new notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>. Examples include tracking an Uber's proximity or viewing live sports scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>. The new music Live Activity is smaller and allows skipping through songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>, and a live timer notification includes a subtle animation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>.

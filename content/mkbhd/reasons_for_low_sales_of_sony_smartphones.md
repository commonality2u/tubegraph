The reasons for this decline can be attributed to a combination of their targeted appeal and significant challenges in their [[launch_and_marketing_strategy_of_sony_smartphones | launch and marketing strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Reasons for Low Sales

Despite these impressive features, several factors contribute to Sony's struggle in the [[impact_on_the_smartphone_market | smartphone market]]:

### Niche Appeal to Enthusiasts

Sony's focus on high-end, enthusiast-level features often misses the broader consumer market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **Limited Market Segment**: Enthusiasts constitute a very small percentage of the overall [[impact_on_the_smartphone_market | smartphone market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. While enthusiast features can sometimes boost sales, mass appeal is necessary for high sales volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   **Missing Mainstream Features**: For all its advanced [[camera_technology_in_sony_phones | camera]] controls, the phone lacks simple features like a quick night mode, which is desired by many users for easy low-light photos (e.g., [[comparison_to_other_phones_in_the_market | Pixel]]'s Night Sight) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Front-Facing Camera Limitations**: The front-facing [[camera_technology_in_sony_phones | camera]] records only 1080p at 30 frames per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, which is a significant drawback given the growing importance of front [[camera_technology_in_sony_phones | cameras]] for many users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **Unperceived Value**: Most consumers would not notice the 4K [[display_quality_of_sony_smartphones | display]] quality without being told <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>, indicating that this premium feature doesn't significantly drive sales for the average user.
*   **Target Audience Already Equipped**: The manual [[camera_technology_in_sony_phones | camera]] controls primarily appeal to those who already own and use professional mirrorless [[camera_technology_in_sony_phones | cameras]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, making it an added benefit for a specific group rather than a selling point for new customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

### Poor [[launch_and_marketing_strategy_of_sony_smartphones | Launch and Marketing Strategy]]

A major hurdle for Sony is its inability to effectively [[launch_and_marketing_strategy_of_sony_smartphones | launch]] and market its phones to the masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Lack of Awareness**: Many consumers are simply unaware of Sony's smartphones, despite the company's success with other popular products like PlayStation, TVs, and mirrorless [[camera_technology_in_sony_phones | cameras]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Delayed Launches**: Sony often experiences long delays between unveiling a phone and making it available to consumers. For example, the [[features_and_specifications_of_sony_xperia_one_mark_ii | Xperia One Mark II]] was unveiled in May but only became widely available in October <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. This extended period causes hype to die down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   **Poor Execution**: The slow and poorly executed [[launch_and_marketing_strategy_of_sony_smartphones | launch strategy]] suggests a lack of priority for the mobile division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   **Successor Announcements**: Compounding the problem, successors are often announced before the current model is widely released. The [[features_and_specifications_of_sony_xperia_one_mark_ii | Xperia One Mark II]] was released around the same time its successor, the Xperia 5 Mark II, was announced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. This frustrates both consumers (who don't want to buy an [[price_versus_value_in_smartphones | expensive phone]] that's immediately outdated) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a> and reviewers (who find it difficult to provide up-to-date information) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

### Declining Sales Figures

Sony's smartphone sales have seen a steep decline over recent years, falling from nearly 40 million smartphones annually for two consecutive years to just 6.5 million in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. For perspective, [[comparison_to_other_phones_in_the_market | Apple]] sells about that many [[controversies_and_challenges_faced_by_iphone_models | iPhones]] in a single strong week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This downward trend indicates that the current strategy is not effective in regaining [[impact_on_the_smartphone_market | market share]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

Despite these challenges, continued competition in the [[impact_on_the_smartphone_market | smartphone market]] is crucial for product improvement, and there remains hope for Sony's mobile division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

The [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_specifications | Apple Vision Pro]] is a first-generation augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) headset from Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. It will retail starting at $3,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a> and is set to go on sale sometime in early next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Pricing and Cost Justification
The [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_specifications | Apple Vision Pro]] is considered "very expensive" at $3,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:43">[01:17:43]</a>. However, the speaker notes that there isn't a direct comparison product on the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:50">[01:17:50]</a>. This pricing strategy is consistent with other Apple "Pro" products, such as the Pro Display XDR or AirPods Max, which lack direct competitors offering the same combination of features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:54">[01:17:54]</a>.

The high price is attributed to several unique capabilities of the [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_specifications | headset]], including its superior [[user_experience_and_eye_tracking_with_apple_vision_pro | eye tracking]] and [[user_experience_and_interface_of_apple_vision_pro | hand tracking]], which are considered the best seen in any VR headset "by a mile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. Even if an equivalent headset emerged, it wouldn't have integrated features like FaceTime or the seamless connection to the Mac ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:14">[01:18:14]</a>.

## Target Market and Future Potential
The [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | Apple Vision Pro]] is explicitly stated not to be a product for the masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:31">[01:18:31]</a>. Given its "Pro" designation and price point, it is positioned as a "rich person's toy and the developer's muse for right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:23">[01:19:23]</a>.

It is seen as a "series zero" product, akin to the initial Apple Watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:40">[01:18:40]</a>. The direction of the [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_specifications | device]] will largely be shaped by early adopters and developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:48">[01:18:48]</a>, who will determine its practical uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:52">[01:18:52]</a>.

There is speculation about a potential future "Vision SE" model, possibly priced around $400, which could achieve mass adoption and become a "next generation hit product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

### Market Impact on Content Consumption
The speaker believes that the [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | headset]] will cause the [[content_consumption_and_applications_on_apple_vision_pro | content consumption]] industry to "explode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:03">[01:12:03]</a>. Apple's brand power is expected to attract content creators, motion picture studios, and sports leagues to develop content optimized for the [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_specifications | headset]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:18">[01:12:18]</a>. An example given is watching an NBA game courtside in VR, which the speaker would "pay to watch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35">[01:12:35]</a>, estimating a potential price of $10-20 per game or via subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:49">[01:12:49]</a>.

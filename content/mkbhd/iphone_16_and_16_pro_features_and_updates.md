Apple announced new products including the [[iphone_16e_features_and_specifications | iPhone 16]] and [[iphone_16e_features_and_specifications | 16 Pro]], along with new AirPods and Apple Watch, at a recent event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## iPhone 16

The [[iphone_16e_features_and_specifications | iPhone 16]] is considered a very minor incremental update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### Design and Display
*   The [[iphone_16e_features_and_specifications | iPhone 16]] looks very similar to the [[iphone_15_and_15_pro_major_changes | iPhone 15]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   New colors include Ultramarine (Indigo), Teal, Pink, Black, and White <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   The cameras are now lined up next to each other instead of being diagonally oriented, similar to the iPhone 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This new camera alignment enables the phone to shoot spatial videos and pictures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   Other design elements like rounded corners, size of the regular and plus phone, speakers, and antenna lines remain largely the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   The display now features a minimum brightness of 1 nit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   The display is still 60Hz, which is considered disappointing for an $800 flagship in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### Internal Hardware and Performance
*   The chip has been upgraded from A16 Bionic to a new A18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   Performance improvements are in the 20-30% range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   It offers better ray tracing and a two times faster neural engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   The phone includes 8 gigs of RAM, supporting Apple Intelligence features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Battery Life
*   All new phones will have larger batteries, implying better battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   Apple did not provide specific numbers or graphs regarding battery improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   According to Apple's compare page, the [[iphone_15_and_15_pro_major_changes | iPhone 15]] had 20 hours of video playback, while the new [[iphone_16e_features_and_specifications | 16]] gets 22 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### New Buttons
The [[iphone_16e_features_and_specifications | iPhone 16]] features two new buttons:
*   **Action Button**: It now includes the action button from last year's [[iphone_15_pro_advanced_features | Pro]] models, allowing for customized shortcuts like flashlight, Shazam, or Siri shortcuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Camera Control Button**:
    *   This is a second new button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
    *   It's a touch-sensitive cutout covered in Sapphire with a taptic engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
    *   It is an actual button that moves, designed to feel like a two-stage camera shutter button through vibration feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
    *   This "Camera Control area" is pressure-sensitive and functions as a tiny trackpad, allowing for swipes and gestures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
    *   Its functionality is entirely camera-related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
    *   Pressing it from the lock screen opens the camera app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
    *   Within the app, a click takes a photo, and a long press starts a short video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
    *   A half-strength double tap opens a menu for camera options, and sliding a finger along the button changes settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
    *   Third-party camera apps like Snapchat and Instagram will be able to utilize this camera control and slider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
    *   Its placement on the bottom right of the phone is noted as potentially awkward for vertical orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## iPhone 16 Pro

### Design and Display
*   New colors for the [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | Pro]] phones include Desert Titanium (alongside Natural Titanium), a darker Black, and a whiter White <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   The [[iphone_15_pro_design_and_build_changes | Pro]] models retain the same overall design as their predecessors, with the addition of the new camera control button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   Screen sizes have increased to 6.3 inches for the [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | Pro]] and 6.9 inches for the [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | Pro Max]] due to thinner bezels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### Internal Hardware and Performance
*   A new A18 Pro chip is included, representing the highest-end chip in any iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   This chip offers performance and efficiency boosts of 20-30% over last year's [[iphone_15_pro_advanced_features | Pro phone]] for CPU and GPU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   It features improved ray tracing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   The [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | Pro]] models retain the faster USB 3 speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   The [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | Pro Max]] is stated to have the longest battery life ever in an iPhone, thanks to efficiency improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### Camera System
The [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | Pro]] phones introduce three new cameras:
*   A new 48-megapixel main camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   A higher resolution 48-megapixel ultrawide camera, upgraded from the 12-megapixel version of last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   The smaller [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | Pro]] model now includes a 5x telephoto lens, matching the [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | Pro Max]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### Charging and Video Capabilities
*   Wireless charging is slightly faster at 25 watts, achieving 50% charge in 30 minutes with the new MagSafe charger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   The cameras can now shoot 4K 120 FPS slow motion directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

## Apple Intelligence and Software Updates
*   The new iPhones will launch with iOS 18.0, meaning they will not have Apple Intelligence features (like Genmoji, Image Playground, or writing tools) at launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   Features like the new Siri and writing tools will be released bit by bit with later software updates, such as 18.1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   This creates a separation between the hardware upgrade and the software features, with the latter not launching with the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   The two-stage shutter press for the camera control button will also be enabled later this year via a software update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

[[youtube_rewind_concept_and_evolution | YouTube Rewind]], initially conceived as an annual celebration of the platform's top content, creators, and memes, has undergone significant changes over the years, leading to widespread [[Criticism of YouTube Rewind 2018 | criticism]], particularly with its 2018 iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The fundamental issue lies in a divergent vision: creators and audiences view [[youtube_rewind_concept_and_evolution | Rewind]] as a retrospective celebration of the year's biggest YouTube moments, while YouTube, as a company, increasingly sees it as a promotional tool for [[youtubes_relationship_with_advertisers | advertisers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## The Diverging Visions

Creators and their audiences historically anticipated [[youtube_rewind_concept_and_evolution | YouTube Rewind]] as a grand recap of the year's most significant YouTubers, events, and viral trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Being included in [[youtube_rewind_concept_and_evolution | Rewind]] became an honor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

However, as YouTube grew and became a massive company, its focus shifted towards monetization by pairing [[youtubes_relationship_with_advertisers | advertisers]] with content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Consequently, [[youtube_rewind_concept_and_evolution | YouTube Rewind]] transformed into a showcase for content deemed "[[youtubes_relationship_with_advertisers | advertiser-friendly]]," featuring "super clean creators" and traditional late-night show hosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This effectively turned [[youtube_rewind_concept_and_evolution | Rewind]] into "a giant ad for YouTube" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

This disconnect explains why major YouTube figures and events like PewDiePie, Shane Dawson, and the KSI vs. Logan Paul fight—all significant in 2018—were excluded from [[youtube_rewind_concept_and_evolution | Rewind]] 2018, while mainstream celebrities like Will Smith, Trevor Noah, and John Oliver were featured, presumably for their appeal to [[youtubes_relationship_with_advertisers | advertisers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## A Chronology of Change in Style

The style and production of [[youtube_rewind_concept_and_evolution | YouTube Rewind]] have evolved significantly since its inception, contributing to the current [[Criticism of YouTube Rewind 2018 | criticism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. The production of [[youtube_rewind_concept_and_evolution | Rewind]] is handled by a company called PortaLe, with YouTube serving as the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### YouTube Rewind 2011

*   **Duration**: Two minutes long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Concept**: The very first [[youtube_rewind_concept_and_evolution | Rewind]] was simple, featuring Rebecca Black counting down the top 10 most viewed videos of the year, culminating with her own song, "Friday" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Production**: Featured one creator and one song (Avicii's "Levels") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. It included a montage of great moments, memes, and references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### YouTube Rewind 2012

*   **Concept**: This was the first year that actual creators were brought in to shoot new content, rather than just using viral videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **Theme**: The entire video was a "Gangnam Style" remix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Duration**: Four minutes long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Reception**: Considered by some to be "peak [[youtube_rewind_concept_and_evolution | Rewind]]" in terms of video style, allowing viewers to appreciate everything included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### YouTube Rewind 2013

*   **Concept**: The first year YouTube attempted to include "a lot," transitioning to a mashup style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   **Duration**: Six minutes long, featuring six songs in a DJ Earworm mashup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   **Creators**: Included 56 creators, along with Cookie Monster and Jimmy Kimmel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Production**: This was the first [[youtube_rewind_concept_and_evolution | Rewind]] produced by PortaLe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, and likely the first year it was used to appeal to [[youtubes_relationship_with_advertisers | advertisers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Despite this, the community largely accepted it as it felt original and still like a celebration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### YouTube Rewind 2014

*   **Concept**: Continued the mashup style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Creators/Songs**: Featured 95 creators and six songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Style**: Characterized by lots of fast motion and cutting, an attempt to "shove more things in each time," resulting in "absolute chaos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### YouTube Rewind 2017

*   **Concept**: Reached the "peak" of this chaotic style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Content**: Included numerous late-night talk show hosts, creators, and traditional celebrities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Duration**: Seven minutes long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Style**: Described as a "barrage of everything" that is "just flying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

### YouTube Rewind 2018

*   **Reception**: Quickly became the second most disliked video ever uploaded, on pace to surpass Justin Bieber's "Baby" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, representing the "most outwardly hated video ever uploaded to the site" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Attempted Changes**: YouTube initially claimed they would reduce the number of creators from over 300 (in 2017) to 100 in 2018, listening to comments and giving creators a voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Will Smith, for example, reportedly suggested including Fortnite and MKBHD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Creator Experience**: Despite these claims, the production process for creators remained problematic. For instance, the speaker spent a full day shooting for a few seconds of screen time, performing a stunt involving falling out of a Fortnite bus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. The full creative vision for these shoots, which included significant character development and contextualization, was ultimately cut down to fleeting, chaotic clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Continued Issues**: The video continued the chaotic mashup style, trying to include hundreds of things while simultaneously excluding controversial or less "[[youtubes_relationship_with_advertisers | advertiser-friendly]]" content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. This contradictory approach made the exclusions more obvious and frustrated viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

## Conclusion

The core problem of [[youtube_rewind_concept_and_evolution | YouTube Rewind]] is its attempt to appeal to [[youtubes_relationship_with_advertisers | advertisers]] by omitting potentially controversial elements, while simultaneously trying to include a vast number of diverse clips to satisfy everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. This "mashup style" creates a chaotic, hard-to-watch experience that highlights what's missing rather than celebrating what's present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. To improve for future years, it's suggested that YouTube should embrace leaving out some content and selectively highlighting a few truly impactful moments that genuinely represented YouTube that year, akin to the earlier, simpler Rewind videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

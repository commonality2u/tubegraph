Following widespread reports of the [[common_issues_and_fixes_in_the_galaxy_fold|Samsung Galaxy Fold's screen failures]] among reviewers, Samsung issued a statement and took actions regarding the issues. The problems surfaced quickly, with multiple units breaking within days of being in reviewers' hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Initial Response to Reviewer Issues

Upon the initial break of his [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design|Galaxy Fold]], MKBHD emailed Samsung, who appeared "totally understanding" of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. They subsequently replaced his phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. However, shortly after, other reviewers like Dieter from The Verge and Steve Kovach also reported their screens breaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Public Statement and Warnings

Within 48 hours of these incidents becoming public, Samsung released a statement addressing the issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

Samsung's statement outlined two key points:
1.  **For non-peeling issues**: "We received a few reports regarding the main display on the samples provided. We will thoroughly inspect those units in person to determine the cause of the matter." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>
2.  **For screen protector removal**: "A few reviewers reported having removed the top layer of the display causing damage to the screen. The main display on the [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design|Galaxy Fold]] features a top protective layer which is part of the display structure designed to protect the screen from unintentional scratches. Removing the protective layer or adding adhesive to the main display may cause damage so we will ensure this information is clearly delivered to our customers." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>

### Warning on Carrier Units
It was noted that a warning about the protective layer, which reads, "The main screen includes a special protective layer. Peeling that protective layer or using any adhesives on the main screen such as a screen protector or stickers may cause damage," was observed on the plastic of T-Mobile retail units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. However, this warning text was notably absent from the packaging of any review units distributed earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This suggests that the warning was a late addition, implemented sometime between the distribution of review units and their arrival in carrier stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. It's implied that Samsung realized the need for a warning, and it should likely be even more prominent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## Broader Implications and Future Outlook
Despite the issues, Samsung did not announce any delays to the [[samsung_galaxy_fold_relaunch_rumors|Galaxy Fold]]'s planned shipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. The initial release of the [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design|Galaxy Fold]] was seen by some as a "public beta test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

The company has been working on the [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design|Galaxy Fold]] for approximately eight years, reaching a point where they believed it was ready for release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. The problems highlight the delicate nature of folding phones, which require plastic displays instead of glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. While a robot could perform 200,000 folds, this does not necessarily translate to a human user's lifetime of use due to factors like user error, moving parts, and lack of water resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

The incidents represent a significant hurdle for foldable phones in general, affecting public perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. However, there remains optimism for future generations of foldable technology to improve significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

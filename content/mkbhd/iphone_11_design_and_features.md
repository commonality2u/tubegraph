The iPhone 11 is presented as a solid improvement over the iPhone XR, positioned as the recommended iPhone for most buyers due to its features and price drop compared to the Pro models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Its review process is noted as straightforward due to clear and obvious changes from its predecessor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Design Overview

The [[iphone_x_design_and_hardware_review | iPhone X]]-era design remains largely familiar, sharing the same shape, notch, and size as the iPhone XR and iPhone XS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. It is still considered a fairly large phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The device retains the same mute switch, speakers, aluminum rails, and Lightning port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. It also features the same LCD display with a resolution of 1792 by 828, which means it cannot watch HD YouTube videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Water resistance is consistent with the iPhone XR, featuring an IP68 rating, and the buttons remain the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### New Design Elements

*   **Naming Convention:** The device is simply called "iPhone 11," dropping the Roman numerals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Colors:** The iPhone 11 is available in six new, more pastel-like colors: black, green, yellow, purple, red, and white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The Product (RED) variant is lighter than the previous year's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Glass Finishes:** The back of the iPhone 11 features two different glass finishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The main back area, where the Apple logo is now centrally located, has a glossy finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. The camera square, however, has a matte glass finish, which is the opposite of the [[iphone_11_pro_design_and_build | iPhone 11 Pro]]'s design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Both finishes are cut from a single piece of milled glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Dimensions and Weight

The size, thickness, and weight of the iPhone 11 are identical to the iPhone XR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. It remains 8.3 millimeters thick and weighs 194 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Battery Life

According to Apple, the iPhone 11 offers one hour longer battery life than the iPhone XR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. The iPhone XR was known for having excellent battery life, and the iPhone 11 maintains at least equivalent battery life due to its more efficient A13 Bionic chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Camera System

The camera system is considered the most significant new feature of the iPhone 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### New Features

*   **Dual Camera System:** The iPhone 11 includes a new main camera and adds a second ultra-wide camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Video Recording:** It supports 4K video recording from both the regular and ultra-wide cameras, with the ability to switch between lenses while recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Improved Portrait Mode:** Portrait mode no longer requires detecting a human face, allowing for shallow depth of field effects with animals and objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Front-Facing Camera:** A new wider front-facing camera is included, capable of taking slow-motion selfie videos ("slofies") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Comparison

The iPhone 11 lacks the third telephoto camera found on the [[iphone_11_pro_design_and_build | iPhone 11 Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Both included cameras are described as excellent, A-plus smartphone cameras for 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. The iPhone 11 is arguably considered to have the best camera in a $700 smartphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, potentially competing with the Pixel 3, but offering the advantage of an ultra-wide camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. More detailed comparisons are available in the [[software_and_features_in_iphone_11_pro | iPhone 11 Pro review]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Pricing

The iPhone 11's starting price for the 64GB model is $700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This pricing fits into Apple's tiered iPhone lineup, which also includes the continued sale of the iPhone XR (at a lower price) and the iPhone 8 (at an even lower price) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

## Recommendations and Considerations

The iPhone 11 is generally recommended as the iPhone most people should buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. However, potential buyers should consider two main aspects:

*   **Display Quality:** The display is considered the phone's biggest weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. While many users may not notice, the LCD display's resolution is just over 720p, despite YouTube sometimes appearing to allow 1080p selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. For those who prioritize a sharp, high-resolution display, an OLED iPhone like the iPhone XS or [[iphone_11_pro_display_features | iPhone 11 Pro]] might be a better choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Size:** The iPhone 11 has a 6.1-inch screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. If this size is too large, the slightly smaller [[iphone_11_pro_design_and_build | iPhone 11 Pro]] offers a better display but at a higher cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Conversely, for those desiring an even larger screen, the iPhone 11 Pro Max is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

For budget-conscious buyers, the iPhone XR, priced at $600, remains a competitive option if the advanced camera system of the iPhone 11 is not a priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. The iPhone 8 is also still available for an even lower price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

Marques Brownlee (MKBHD) shares his personal reflections on current events, including the global pandemic, political climate, and protests against police brutality, inspired by Neil deGrasse Tyson's post of the same name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. As a tech YouTuber who began creating videos at 15 years old, Brownlee has successfully turned his passion into a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This journey has brought about [[challenges_for_content_creators_with_product_reviews | unintentional consequences]], such as making hiring or management decisions and addressing ethical questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. He credits his supportive parents for encouraging him to explore new things and experiment to find his interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Personal Experiences with Diversity

Brownlee's interests, like golf, ultimate frisbee, and tech, were initially chosen purely out of personal interest, not related to his race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. However, the deeper he delved into these communities and activities, the more his identity as a Black individual became a factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. These activities served as an escape from the outside world, but this feeling of isolation ends once he leaves, as he is brought back to the reality of potentially being pulled over for minor or racial reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. He notes that both he and his friends have had encounters with the police, and he also has family members in law enforcement who are frustrated by the same issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### [[challenges_and_privileges_in_diverse_activities | Challenges and Privileges in Diverse Activities]]
Brownlee acknowledges the privilege of his parents finding diverse golf camps and schools with ultimate frisbee teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Yet, as he reached higher levels in golf, ultimate frisbee, and tech, he observed a lack of diversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This spotlighted the color of his skin, creating an internal conflict where he felt proud of his identity but also wished to be recognized solely for his skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. For instance, he wanted to be "one of the better frisbee players," not "the good black frisbee player," and "one of the best creators," not "one of the best black creators" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This led to self-doubt, making him question if his achievements were due to his merit or if he was chosen because he was Black or had a platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## Using a Platform for Change

As an adult with a platform, Brownlee feels a responsibility to speak up on issues affecting his community, despite the common advice to "stick to tech" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. He believes that silence on issues plaguing his community feels worse than speaking up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

He aims to use his platform for two main purposes:
1.  **Anti-Racism**: To convey that racism is unacceptable and requires active work against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. He finds it baffling how being anti-racist could be controversial and states he has no issue with losing racist followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
2.  **Role Model**: To be a figure that kids, particularly those who look like him, can look up to, seeing someone making good choices and finding success at a high level in various fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

Brownlee emphasizes that while people are asking how they can help, he is not the one who needs assistance; rather, it is the organizations on the front lines supporting the cause that require donations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

### Effective Support for Creators
He specifically asks for support in a way that aligns with his experience: by genuinely supporting diverse creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. He advises against simply subscribing to new channels without engaging with their content, as this sends a negative signal to YouTube's algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. If users subscribe but do not watch, YouTube may flag the content as uninteresting, making it harder for the channel to surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Instead, he encourages finding a diverse group of creators, getting into and enjoying their content, and truly appreciating their creations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. He offers to link some of his favorite diverse creators and invites others to share their suggestions in the comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

Brownlee concludes by stating that there are no easy answers, and everyone has different struggles and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. While social media makes these issues feel current, the fight against racism is an ongoing, historical, and future challenge that requires spreading the message, being responsible, [[using_platforms_for_advocacy_and_antiracism | using voices]], and moving the needle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

The introduction of the new Apple Magic Keyboard case for the [[iPad Pro as a laptop replacement | iPad Pro]] has re-stoked the debate of whether the iPad Pro can serve as a full-time computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. While the iPad Pro itself was "barely actually different" from previous models, the addition of the Magic Keyboard and new mouse and cursor support in iPadOS reignited interest in its laptop potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## The Magic Keyboard Case for iPad Pro

The Magic Keyboard case is considered by some to be "the most interesting case" seen in a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

### Pricing and Components

*   **Cost:** The smaller version costs $300, and the larger version costs $350 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Build:** It is described as a "pretty substantial, like, nice case" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
    *   **Top Part:** Full of strong magnets that lock securely onto the iPad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
    *   **Hinge:** A long metal tube through the middle with a USB-C pass-through port for charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This hinge is stiff like a laptop's and has a locking point that snaps into place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. The hinge allows the iPad to float above the keyboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
    *   **Base:** Made of a silicon rubberized material, featuring a full-size backlit keyboard and trackpad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Weight and Dimensions

The case adds significant weight and thickness:
*   A large [[iPad Pro as a laptop replacement | iPad Pro]] weighs 640 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   The Magic Keyboard case by itself weighs 702 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   Combined, the iPad Pro and Magic Keyboard are thicker and heavier than a MacBook Air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### Keyboard and Trackpad

*   **Keyboard:** Uses scissor switches, providing a nice travel and clicky feel similar to new MacBook Air and 16-inch MacBook Pro keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The board is stiff with no flex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. It is backlit, which draws extra power from the iPad's battery, but it's a "nice touch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. It's considered the "best keyboard" in an iPad case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **Trackpad:** Not as large as a full-size laptop trackpad, but "nice" and completes the laptop feel with the new iOS cursor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. It physically clicks everywhere from corner to corner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### Charging and Functionality

*   The USB-C pass-through port is at the bottom, like a normal computer port, and achieves almost 100% charging efficiency through the pins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   With the case, the iPad Pro feels like a "real 13-inch laptop-ish computer" with a 120Hz screen and iPadOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

## iPad Pro as a Laptop Replacement: Quirks and Limitations

Despite the advancements, using the [[iPad Pro as a laptop replacement | iPad Pro as a full-time computer]] still presents several challenges compared to a dedicated laptop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

> [!WARNING] The following points highlight areas where the iPad Pro, even with the Magic Keyboard, may not fully replicate a traditional laptop experience.

*   **Weight Distribution:** Unlike a laptop where the "guts" are at the bottom, the iPad is the computer, so most of the weight is at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This makes the setup feel "a little bit top-heavy," even though the case is heavy to try and combat this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **"Lappability":** While "most of the classic laptop positions are still fine," it's "not as flexible as a truly bottom-weighted laptop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Missing Keys/Functionality:**
    *   **No Escape Key:** To exit a full-screen video or typically escape an action, users must touch the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
    *   **No Function Buttons:** There are no brightness, volume, or even keyboard backlight brightness shortcuts on the keyboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Adjusting keyboard brightness requires navigating deep into the Settings app (Settings > General > Keyboard Settings > Keyboard Hardware Settings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
    *   **Command-Q Quitting:** The `Command + Q` shortcut does not work conventionally to quit an app directly; users must enter the `Command + Tab` menu, find the app, and then `Command + Q` to close it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Users can use `Command + H` to go home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Learning Curve for iPadOS:** There are many gestures from the trackpad and keyboard shortcuts to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Holding down the Command key reveals a list of available shortcuts in any given app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Multitasking Limitations:** Basic multitasking operations can be cumbersome; for example, skipping a song in Spotify while writing a review requires leaving the current app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Taking notes during a Zoom call on an iPad is also difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

## Pricing and Value Comparison with other iPads

The iPad Pro with the Magic Keyboard is a significant investment. A MacBook Air costs $1200, while a 13-inch [[iPad Pro as a laptop replacement | iPad Pro]] (priced at $1000) combined with the $350 Magic Keyboard case totals $1350 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[New magic keyboard folio for iPad | Magic Keyboard case]] makes the iPad Pro the "best version of the iPad as a computer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. It offers the flexibility to pop off and have an iPad at any time, then reattach for typing, with a 120Hz screen, more apps, and cameras, making it "more fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

However, the reviewer still prefers a traditional laptop for certain tasks, especially multitasking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

The setup is ideal for those who primarily use their iPad as a tablet but occasionally need to type, allowing them to easily switch between modes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. For such users, the Magic Keyboard is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. For someone who needs a laptop for consistent, flexible computer work, a dedicated laptop might still be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

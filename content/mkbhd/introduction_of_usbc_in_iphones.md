Apple's new iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro models, introduced at the Wonderlust event, feature [[USBC integration in iPhones | USB-C]] connectivity across the board, marking a significant shift from the long-standing Lightning port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This change is considered a major update, as it is only the second port change in the iPhone's history, the first being the transition from the 30-pin connector to Lightning in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## [[USBC integration in iPhones | USB-C Integration Across the Lineup]]

The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, alongside the Pro models, have all adopted [[USBC integration in iPhones | USB-C]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This move brings Apple's flagship phones in line with other laptops and tablets that have used this port for several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. It is anticipated that other Apple devices, such as the baseline iPad and iPhone SE, will also eventually transition to [[USBC integration in iPhones | USB-C]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

The primary benefit of this change is the ability to use a single cable to charge various devices, including Macs, iPads, iPhones, Android phones, and even the new AirPods, which now come with a [[USBC integration in iPhones | USB-C]] case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Additionally, the iPhone 15 models can charge accessories like the new AirPods using the included C-to-C cable, drawing power directly from the iPhone's battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. However, there is no wireless reverse charging feature available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## [[Significance of USBC port in iPhone 15 Pro | USB-C on iPhone 15 Pro Models]]

While all iPhone 15 models feature [[USBC integration in iPhones | USB-C]], there's a key distinction in data transfer speeds. The iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max include a new USB 3 controller on their A17 Pro chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This enables these Pro models to achieve faster USB 3 data transfer speeds of up to 10 gigabits per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

In contrast, the base iPhone 15 and 15 Plus models, which lack this controller, are limited to USB 2.0 speeds, similar to the previous Lightning connections, at approximately 480 megabits per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This difference is particularly relevant for Pro users who frequently transfer large files like ProRes video or ProRaw photos, as faster speeds significantly reduce transfer times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Despite the upgrade, the USB-C implementation on the Pro models does not offer Thunderbolt speeds (20-40 gigabits per second) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## [[USBC cable inclusion and charging brick absence | Charging and Accessories]]

Despite the transition to [[USBC integration in iPhones | USB-C]], the iPhone 15 series does not introduce faster charging speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Charging remains at around 20 watts, meaning the phones will still take approximately 1.5 to 2 hours to fully charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

The inclusion of [[USBC integration in iPhones | USB-C]] on iPhones is expected to spur the development of new [[USBC integration in iPhones | USB-C]] phone accessories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. For example, brands like Anker have already launched new product lineups specifically for the iPhone 15, including [[USBC integration in iPhones | USB-C]] power banks and braided [[USBC integration in iPhones | USB-C]] cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

At the time of release, some older Apple accessories such as MagSafe Duo, AirPods Max, and Magic Trackpad still utilize the Lightning connector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

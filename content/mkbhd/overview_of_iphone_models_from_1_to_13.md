Since its inception, the iPhone has evolved significantly, from its revolutionary debut to the sophisticated [[iphone_13_lineup_and_features | iPhone 13 lineup]] of today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This article reviews every model released from the original iPhone through to the [[iphone_13_lineup_and_features | iPhone 13]] series, highlighting key innovations and changes over 14 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## The Original iPhone

Unveiled by Steve Jobs at Macworld 2007, the first iPhone was a legendary device, combining an iPod, a phone, and a breakthrough internet communicator into a single unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Its release on January 9th, 2007, marked a clear inflection point for smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

Key features of the original iPhone:
*   **Design** It featured a recognizable two-tone design with metal on top and plastic at the bottom for antenna pass-through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. It established the trend of rounded corners and a flat front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **User Interface** It relied entirely on a multi-touch screen, including a virtual keyboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Limitations at Launch** Notably, it lacked an App Store, limiting users to pre-installed apps like Safari, YouTube, and Google Maps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Users couldn't even set a custom wallpaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Specifications** It had a 3.5-inch display, a 2-megapixel rear camera, and launched with 4GB or 8GB storage options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The starting price was $499 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Unique Characteristics** It was the only iPhone with a SIM card tray at the top and the only two-tone iPhone ever made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## iPhone 3G

The [[iPhone 3G]] was named for its adoption of the 3G network, replacing the slower Edge network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Design & Battery** It featured a more refined, all-black plastic design, feeling smoother and thinner due to its tapered shape. This tapering, however, led to a smaller internal battery compared to the original iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Software Milestone** This model launched with the App Store, initially offering 500 applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## iPhone 3GS

The first "S" update, the iPhone 3GS, primarily focused on speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Internal Upgrades** It featured a Samsung-made chip that was twice as fast as its predecessor, 256MB of RAM, and a 3-megapixel camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Software Enhancements** iPhone OS 3 introduced long-awaited features like cut, copy, and paste, and for the first time, video recording within the camera app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **"Gate" Issue** A "gate" issue emerged with the white version, which suffered from discoloration due to heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## iPhone 4

The iPhone 4, often considered one of Apple's best designs, was significantly hyped due to leaks prior to its launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Revolutionary Design** It introduced a new square design with flat stainless steel sides and an all-glass front and back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. It was marketed as the thinnest smartphone at 9.4mm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Retina Display** This was the first iPhone with a higher resolution Retina display, doubling pixel density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Performance & Features** It featured Apple's first branded chip (A4), 512MB of RAM, enabling multitasking for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. It also introduced a front-facing (selfie) camera for FaceTime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. The rear camera was upgraded to 5 megapixels, capable of 720p video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Antennagate** A major controversy, "Antennagate," arose where gripping the phone in a specific way caused a significant drop in signal strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Apple's response included recommending users avoid holding the phone "like that" and offering free bumper cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   **Last Steve Jobs Unveil** This was the last iPhone personally unveiled by Steve Jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

## iPhone 4S

Another "S" update, the iPhone 4S focused on internal speed upgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Design & Camera** The external design remained largely the same as the iPhone 4, with an improved antenna layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. It featured a new 8-megapixel camera capable of 1080p video recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Siri Introduction** The "S" in iPhone 4S officially stood for Siri, Apple's voice assistant, which debuted with this phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

## iPhone 5

The iPhone 5 addressed user demand for a larger display, marking the beginning of screen size inflation for the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Larger Display** After all previous iPhones had 3.5-inch displays, this model featured a 4-inch Retina display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Connectivity & Performance** It was the first iPhone with LTE connectivity and 1GB of RAM, further enhancing multitasking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **Lightning Port** A significant change was the replacement of the 30-pin connector with the smaller, reversible Lightning port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Apple Maps Controversy** A notable misstep was the replacement of the pre-loaded Google Maps app with the poorly received Apple Maps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

## iPhone 5S & iPhone 5C

2013 saw the introduction of two distinct [[iPhone model | iPhone models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   **iPhone 5S** This continued the flagship line, starting at $649 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. Its key innovation was the Touch ID fingerprint reader integrated into the home button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   **iPhone 5C** Marketed as a cheaper, more colorful option, the 5C was essentially a repackaged iPhone 5 in a plastic body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. It was priced at $99 with a contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. These models reflected Apple's response to pressure from the Android market's larger screens and more affordable options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

## iPhone 6 & iPhone 6 Plus

These models, while not always favored for their design, became some of the best-selling smartphones ever, selling over 220 million units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.
*   **Design & Size** The square sides were replaced with a much thinner, more rounded design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. They were the first iPhones with a camera bump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. The iPhone 6 featured a 4.7-inch display, and the first-ever "Plus" size, the iPhone 6 Plus, had a massive 5.5-inch 1080p "Retina HD" display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. The increased size necessitated moving the power button to the side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
*   **Bendgate** A significant [[controversies_and_challenges_faced_by_iphone_models | durability issue]] emerged, famously dubbed "Bendgate," where the phones, particularly the larger Plus model, were prone to bending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

## iPhone 6S & iPhone 6S Plus

These "S" models primarily addressed the durability concerns and introduced new interactive features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
*   **Durability & Performance** They featured reinforced 7000 series aluminum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. Performance was boosted, doubling RAM to 2GB, powered by the Apple A9 chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.
*   **3D Touch & Taptic Engine** The highlight was 3D Touch, a pressure-sensitive display layer, paired with the new Taptic Engine for advanced haptic feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. While innovative, 3D Touch was eventually phased out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.
*   **Camera** The camera was upgraded to 12 megapixels, a resolution that would remain standard for many subsequent iPhone models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.
*   **Battery** Despite upgrades, these models had a smaller battery than the previous year due to internal space constraints from the new aluminum and 3D Touch components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

## iPhone SE (1st Generation)

A surprise mid-cycle addition, the iPhone SE brought back a smaller form factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.
*   **"Small Edition"** Officially standing for "Special Edition," it was effectively the "small edition," featuring the 4-inch screen size of the iPhone 5 series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.
*   **Internals & Price** It combined the body of an iPhone 5S with the faster chip and 12-megapixel camera of the iPhone 6S <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. It was also cheaper than the flagship models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. This model is notable for being the oldest iPhone still supporting the newest version of iOS (iOS 15 at the time of the transcript) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

## iPhone 7 & iPhone 7 Plus

These models made significant changes that influenced the wider smartphone market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.
*   **Dual Cameras (Plus)** The Plus-sized model introduced multiple cameras for the first time on an iPhone, featuring a telephoto lens for optical zoom and portrait mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.
*   **Haptic Home Button** The physical home button was replaced with a solid-state, force-touch home button that used the Taptic Engine to simulate a click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.
*   **Removal of Headphone Jack** Most controversially, these were the first iPhones to remove the 3.5mm headphone jack, a decision Apple famously called "courage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. This move coincided with the announcement of AirPods, which would become incredibly popular wireless earbuds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.
*   **"Pro" Branching** The iPhone 7 Plus, with its extra camera and additional gigabyte of RAM, subtly introduced the idea of a "pro" iPhone model, offering more advanced features than the standard size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.
*   **Jet Black Finish** The highly reflective "Jet Black" finish was introduced, though it was prone to fingerprints and scratches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.

## iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, & iPhone X

2017 brought three new [[iPhone model | iPhone models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>.
*   **iPhone 8 & 8 Plus** These were minor updates to the iPhone 7 design, focusing on spec bumps, True Tone display, wireless charging, and the ability to record 4K 60fps video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.
*   **iPhone X** The "iPhone X" (pronounced "ten") was a radical redesign, marking the "true beginning of the future of the iPhone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.
    *   **Design** It eliminated the home button, relying entirely on gestures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. Bezels were drastically reduced with a new OLED screen (first for an iPhone) that wrapped around the corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>.
    *   **Face ID** With Touch ID gone, Face ID, a facial recognition system with an IR blaster and dot projector, was introduced via a "notch" at the top of the display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.
    *   **Price Tag** Its most impactful aspect was its unprecedented starting price of $999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. This set a new precedent for high-end smartphone pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.
    *   **Discontinuation** The iPhone X was the fastest discontinued iPhone, lasting only 10 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.

## iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, & iPhone XR

Following the iPhone X's new form factor, Apple refined its lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.
*   **iPhone XS** A refinement of the iPhone X, offering spec bumps within the same design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>.
*   **iPhone XS Max** Introduced an even larger "Max" size with a 6.46-inch screen, the biggest ever in an iPhone at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>.
*   **iPhone XR** Positioned as a more affordable option, essentially bringing the iPhone 8's internals into the new notch design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>. It featured a lower-resolution 720p LCD screen but became the recommended model for most users due to its balance of features and price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. It also came in a variety of [[colors_and_design_changes_in_iphone_15_models | colorful options]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

## iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, & iPhone 11 Pro Max

The naming scheme simplified, introducing the "Pro" designation for the higher-end [[comparison_of_iphone_11_pro_to_previous_models | iPhone models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.
*   **iPhone 11** The baseline model with an LCD display, it surprisingly had a larger display than the previous iPhone 8 Plus, indicating continued screen size inflation across the lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.
*   **iPhone 11 Pro & 11 Pro Max** These were Apple's first "Pro" branded phones, featuring triple cameras on the back, including the first-ever ultra-wide lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.
*   **Haptic Touch** 3D Touch was officially killed off in favor of Haptic Touch, which relies on a long press rather than pressure sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.
*   **Persistent Notch** Despite competitors moving to smaller cutouts, the iPhone maintained its notch design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>.

## iPhone SE (2nd Generation)

Another mid-year refresh, the second-generation iPhone SE, continued the tradition of a smaller, more affordable option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>.
*   **Design & Performance** It utilized the iPhone 8's body with a 4.7-inch display, making it the smallest iPhone Apple offered at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. It packed a newer chip and camera from the flagship models, offering strong camera and performance at a $399 starting price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.

## iPhone 12 Lineup

The [[iphone_12_lineup_overview | iPhone 12 lineup]] introduced four models: iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>.
*   **Design** The square sides from the iPhone 4/5 era made a return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>.
*   **Connectivity** This was the first iPhone series to support 5G connectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.
*   **Camera Differentiation** The iPhone 12 Pro Max received a slightly superior camera system compared to the other Pro models, including a larger primary sensor with sensor-shift stabilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>.
*   **iPhone 12 Mini** A new "Mini" size was introduced, ironically having roughly the same screen size as the iPhone 8 Plus from just three years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>.
*   **Box Contents** The [[iphone_12_lineup_overview | iPhone 12 lineup]] became famous for shipping in smaller boxes that no longer included a charging brick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.

## iPhone 13 Lineup

The current [[iphone_13_lineup_and_features | iPhone 13 lineup]] maintains the same four-model structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.
*   **Minor Updates** It was largely a minor update on paper, focusing on the "three most important areas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>.
*   **Cameras** All cameras improved across the board, with the Pro models featuring what the speaker considers the best smartphone camera system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>.
*   **Battery Life** Battery life significantly improved, attributed to the phones being slightly thicker and heavier with larger batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.
*   **Displays** The displays were enhanced, particularly the Pro models, which finally gained a high refresh rate ProMotion display (up to 120Hz) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>.
*   **ProRes Video** ProRes video recording for Pro iPhones was announced but required a software update post-launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:58">[00:28:58]</a>.

## Key Trends Across iPhone Generations

Across 14 years, 33 different [[iPhone model | iPhone models]] have been released, with over a billion active iPhones in use today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>. Several patterns emerge when looking at the evolution of the iPhone:

*   **Storage** Initial models had 4GB or 8GB of storage. This has steadily increased over the years, with max storage now exceeding 1000GB (1TB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>.
*   **Performance (RAM)** RAM remained stable at 1GB for a period but has steadily increased since, supporting greater multitasking capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.

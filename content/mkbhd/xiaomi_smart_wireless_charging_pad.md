The Xiaomi Smart Wireless Charging Pad was awarded the "most extra tech feature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. It was released alongside the Xiaomi Mi 10 Ultra phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Design and Functionality
The charging pad is described as a "pretty big pad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, or "huge pad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Its primary feature is its ability to automatically move an internal charging coil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. When a device is placed anywhere on the pad, the coil inside shifts to find and line up with the device's charging coil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Users can hear the internal motors moving as it aligns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

This feature aims to eliminate the inconvenience of manually aligning a device perfectly on a traditional wireless charger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Users can simply "slap it down anywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Charging Capabilities
The Xiaomi Smart Wireless Charging Pad functions as a 20-watt wireless charger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. While not considered "super fast charging," it provides a high enough charging rate for regular use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Multi-Device Support
Although it does not charge multiple devices simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, the pad offers sequential charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. It charges one device completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, and once that device is fully charged, the coil automatically moves to a second device placed on the pad and begins charging it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This allows users to leave several devices on the pad overnight, and they will eventually all be charged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

The pad is found to be convenient for quickly charging a phone to gain "a couple extra percent battery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

The iPhone 13 lineup features several updates to its [[screen_and_display_specifications | displays]] compared to previous models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

## General Display Features
The new [[screen_and_display_specifications | screens]] maintain the same sizes as the prior year's models but are now brighter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. The Pro models, in particular, feature 120 Hz [[adaptive_refresh_rate_technology | ProMotion]] technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. The display on the iPhone 13 Pro is a 120 Hz HDR OLED, described as beautiful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

## Notch Reductions
A notable change is a 20% smaller [[display_and_notch_details | notch]], achieved by moving the earpiece to the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. However, this smaller [[display_and_notch_details | notch]] reportedly makes almost no practical difference to the user's eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Users don't gain much screen real estate, and Apple has not added an option to display the battery percentage in the status bar or utilized the extra space for other information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

## ProMotion (120 Hz Refresh Rate)
The 120 Hz [[adaptive_refresh_rate_technology | ProMotion]] feature on the Pro models is described as "legit," "amazing," and "very nice looking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Despite Apple's previous 60 Hz phones being considered some of the smoothest, the high refresh rate of the iPhone 13 Pro was immediately noticeable and impressive upon first unlocking the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

Animations across virtually every app and even pre-launch phone animations run at 120 Hz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Even apps like Instagram and TikTok, which typically require updates to support new [[screen_and_display_specifications | display]] features, are running at 120 Hz out of the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This high refresh rate significantly enhances the user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. This new [[optics_and_displays | display]] technology is considered better than even the [[baseline_ipad_updates | iPad Pro]]'s [[screen_and_display_specifications | display]] because it combines 120 Hz with OLED and HDR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

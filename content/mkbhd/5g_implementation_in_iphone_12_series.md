The arrival of 5G on the [[5g_capabilities_in_iphone_12 | iPhone]] was a highly anticipated topic, with significant promises made at its keynote unveiling, including a presentation by the Verizon CEO discussing 5G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>. The initial claim was that 5G "just got real" with its addition to the [[5g_capabilities_in_iphone_12 | iPhone 12 series]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>.

## Promises vs. Reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>
In reality, the rollout of 5G globally is an infrastructure process that will happen slowly through literal building, not instantly due to any single phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>. While the [[5g_capabilities_in_iphone_12 | iPhone 12 series]] has indeed introduced millions more 5G customers into the world, the actual impact on day-to-day speeds has been minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

Promises of a "wild, awesome 5G enabled future" with robot taxis, remote robot surgeries, and extremely fast internet speeds everywhere are not yet realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>. Realistically, 5G speeds are often not dramatically better than 4G speeds, and can sometimes even be worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>. The rare exception is when users are within a "stone's throw" of a millimeter wave tower, where incredible speeds might be achieved until the user moves away or an obstacle interferes with the signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>.

## Impact on Battery Life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>
Apple has managed to minimize 5G's effect on battery life commendably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>. Unlike some early 5G phones that experienced worse battery life due to inefficient signal hunting, the [[5g_capabilities_in_iphone_12 | iPhone]] employs effective power management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. It is known to only connect to 5G when actively downloading or using a lot of data, otherwise showing the 5G logo without actually being connected, thereby saving battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:23">[00:40:23]</a>. This means the effect on battery life has been minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>.

## Market Implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>
With the launch of the [[5g_capabilities_in_iphone_12 | iPhone 12 series]], millions of people now possess their first 5G-enabled phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>. Some will benefit immediately from existing 5G coverage, others will see benefits as coverage expands in their area, and some will not benefit at all and can opt to turn 5G off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>. An interesting side effect is that for those who did not upgrade to a 5G phone, the departure of millions of users from the 4G network may actually improve their 4G speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>.

Overall, 5G did not "suddenly get real" with the [[5g_capabilities_in_iphone_12 | iPhone 12 series]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>, but it marks a step towards broader 5G adoption among internet users worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>.

The [[new_magic_keyboard_folio_for_ipad | new Apple Magic Keyboard case]] for the new iPad Pro is considered the "most interesting case" seen in a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. It garnered significant hype, being announced alongside a new iPad that was only minimally different from its predecessor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This case, coupled with new mouse and cursor support on the iPad, re-stoked the discussion about whether the iPad Pro can serve as a full-time computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

While using the new iPad with this [[new_magic_keyboard_folio_for_ipad | Magic Case]] as a primary computer, it's concluded that this setup represents "the best version of the iPad as a computer for sure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. However, a traditional laptop is still preferred for certain tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Pricing
*   Small model: $300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   Bigger model: $350 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>

## [[design_and_build_quality_of_apple_magic_keyboard | Design and Build Quality]]
The [[new_magic_keyboard_folio_for_ipad | Apple Magic Keyboard case]] is a "pretty substantial, like nice case" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a> and is described as "well built" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

Key components and features include:
*   **Top Part:** Full of strong magnets that securely lock onto the iPad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **Hinge:** A long metal tube through the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. It's stiff like a laptop hinge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a> and has a locking point where it snaps into place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. The hinge allows the iPad to float above the keyboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Its limited range of motion is generally sufficient for normal use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **USB Type-C Pass-through Port:** Located on the side of the hinge for charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. It provides almost 100% charging efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Base:** Made of a silicon rubberized material, similar to other [[apples_airpods_pro_case | Apple cases]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Keyboard:** A full-size backlit keyboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. It uses scissor switches, offering nice travel and a clicky feel akin to newer MacBook Air and 16-inch MacBook Pro keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The board is stiff with "no flex at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. The backlight, while drawing extra power, is a "nice touch" that fades on and off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, making it the "best keyboard" seen in an iPad case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **Trackpad:** Completes the laptop feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a> with the new iOS cursor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. It is physically clickable from corner to corner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## Weight and Portability
The case itself is "thicker and heavier" than one might imagine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   12.9-inch iPad Pro: 640 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>
*   Case by itself: 702 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>
*   Combined: The iPad Pro and case are thicker and heavier than a MacBook Air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## [[user_experience_with_apple_magic_keyboard | User Experience]] and Limitations
Despite its robust build, the [[new_magic_keyboard_folio_for_ipad | Magic Keyboard Case]] presents some unique challenges compared to a traditional laptop:

*   **Weight Management:** The iPad, being the computer, holds most of the weight at the top, making the setup feel "a little bit top-heavy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. The case's own weight attempts to combat this, but it's "not perfect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Lappability:** It is "lappable" in most classic laptop positions and performs "better than you might expect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. However, it's "still not as flexible" as a bottom-weighted laptop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   **Missing Keys:**
    *   **No Escape Key:** Users must touch the screen to exit full-screen video or other functions typically handled by an escape key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
    *   **No Function Buttons:** Lacks dedicated buttons for brightness, volume, or keyboard backlight brightness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Adjusting keyboard brightness requires navigating deep into settings: Settings app > General > Keyboard Settings > Keyboard Hardware Settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Auto-brightness generally works well using the iPad's sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **App Quitting:** The `Command + Q` shortcut does not work as expected within an app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Users must either touch the screen or use `Command + H` to go home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. To truly close an app without touching the screen, navigate to the `Command + Tab` menu, find the app, and then press `Command + Q` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Gestures and Shortcuts:** There's a learning curve for trackpad gestures and keyboard shortcuts specific to iPadOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Holding down the `Command` key reveals a list of available keyboard shortcuts for the current app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **Multitasking Limitations:** Multitasking, such as writing a review while trying to skip a song in the background, is less fluid than on a laptop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Performing tasks like a Zoom call and taking notes simultaneously is also challenging on an iPad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

### Conclusion for Specific User Types
This setup is ideal for individuals who primarily use their iPad as a tablet but occasionally need a typing machine. For this user type, the [[new_magic_keyboard_folio_for_ipad | Magic Keyboard case]] is the "best possible version of the iPad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. However, for those who need a full laptop experience, it may not entirely replace a dedicated laptop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

The iPhone XR (referred to as the iPhone 10r in the transcript) features a single main camera on its rear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. This camera is identical to the primary camera found on the iPhone 10s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. While some users have reported slight differences in image quality between the iPhone XR and 10s cameras, testing by the reviewer did not confirm this, deeming it to still be a very good [[iPhone camera capabilities and features|iPhone camera]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## Key Differences from iPhone 10s
The most significant difference in the camera setup is the absence of the second telephoto lens found on the iPhone 10s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This omission has several implications, some of which are not entirely negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. The telephoto camera typically serves two main functions: optical zoom and [[iPhone camera capabilities and features|Portrait Mode]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### Optical Zoom
Optical zoom is not available on the iPhone XR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Users will instead rely on digital zoom, which generally results in worse quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. However, it's noted that the telephoto lens on iPhones has historically been a lower-quality sensor that lets in less light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. In low-light or other challenging conditions, iPhones often default to using a digital zoom from the primary lens anyway, as it yields better results than the darker telephoto lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Therefore, the lack of a telephoto lens might affect fewer zoom scenarios than commonly believed, and often better results can be achieved by using the primary camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

### Portrait Mode
The iPhone XR's [[iPhone camera capabilities and features|Portrait Mode]] operates differently from the iPhone 10s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The iPhone 10s utilizes both cameras for depth detection and the telephoto lens for a natural bokeh effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. The iPhone XR, lacking the second lens, uses only the better-quality primary camera for Portrait Mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This results in a wider-angle portrait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, which some consider a more visually interesting look with a shallow depth of field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. The background blur has been remapped to mimic a wide-angle optic rather than a telephoto, leading to noticeable differences in bokeh, sometimes appearing more "swirly" and with more character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

#### Limitations of Portrait Mode
A significant drawback of the iPhone XR's Portrait Mode is its reliance entirely on software for depth detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. As a result, Apple has limited this feature to photos of human faces only <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Attempting to take a portrait of any other object will not work, as the phone will indicate it is waiting for a person to be detected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This means no portrait shots of objects are possible on the iPhone XR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

## Overall Assessment
While the camera setup presents some downsides when compared directly to the iPhone 10s, particularly regarding the display and camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, for users upgrading from older models like the iPhone 8 or iPhone 7, the iPhone XR represents an upgrade in nearly every aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

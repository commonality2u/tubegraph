The [[iphone_xr_design_and_build_quality | iPhone XR]] features a 6.1-inch display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This size positions it between the [[iphone_x_display_features_and_performance | iPhone XS]] and [[iphone_x_display_features_and_performance | iPhone XS Max]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The 6.1-inch display sits in the middle, which can make it harder for most people to reach the corners and tops of the screen due to its size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Liquid Retina Display Technology

Apple calls the [[iphone_xr_display_features | iPhone XR]]'s screen a "Liquid Retina display" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This is an LCD panel with curved corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The resolution of the display is 1792 by 828 pixels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, and it is surrounded by a slightly thicker bezel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

### Clarity and Visual Quality

The panel itself offers great color and brightness, along with pretty good viewing angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. The display is described as crisp enough for regular use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. When examining it closely, it may appear less sharp than the [[iphone_x_display_features_and_performance | iPhone XS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Despite this, it is considered "not a bad display by any means," being accurate and vibrant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

The pixel density of the [[iphone_xr_display_features | iPhone XR]] is 326 pixels per inch (ppi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. This is the same pixel density as the [[iphone_6_display_and_its_features | iPhone 4]] and the iPhone 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Key Differences from iPhone XS Display

The display is highlighted as the most significant difference when comparing the [[iphone_xr_display_features | iPhone XR]] to the [[iphone_x_display_features_and_performance | iPhone XS]], contributing to the [[iphone_xr_display_features | iPhone XR]]'s lower cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

*   **No OLED:** The [[iphone_xr_display_features | iPhone XR]] uses an LCD, which means it cannot achieve the pitch-black contrast of an OLED display when watching video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **No 3D Touch:** The [[iphone_xr_display_features | iPhone XR]] lacks 3D Touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. While similar functions can be achieved with a long press in the Control Center and on the lock screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, the "peek and pop" functionality for links and previews is almost completely absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Thicker Bezels:** The bezels around the [[iphone_xr_display_features | iPhone XR]] are a couple of millimeters thicker than those on the [[iphone_x_display_features_and_performance | iPhone XS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. This difference is noticeable daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **No Gigabit LTE:** The [[iphone_xr_display_features | iPhone XR]]'s slightly different antenna band locations mean it does not have gigabit LTE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This only affects a small number of people in areas where their carrier supports it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Included Display Features

The [[iphone_xr_display_features | iPhone XR]] display includes:
*   **True Tone:** This feature is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Tap to Wake:** The display supports tap to wake functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Rounded Corners:** The display incorporates rounded corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Display's Impact on Performance and Battery

The choice of a lower-resolution display in the [[iphone_xr_display_features | iPhone XR]] contributes to its efficient performance and excellent battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Because the A12 Bionic chip has fewer pixels to render, the [[iphone_xr_display_features | iPhone XR]]'s battery life is described as excellent, comparable to or sometimes better than the [[display_and_design_of_the_iphone_x | iPhone XS Max]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. The device also has 3GB of RAM, which is sufficient for iOS when managing fewer pixels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

[[new_home_screen_features_in_ios_14 | iOS 14]] introduced significant changes to the Home Screen, with widgets being a central feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. While long available on Android, Apple implemented widgets in its own distinct way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Introduction and Placement
Widgets in [[new_home_screen_features_in_ios_14 | iOS 14]] are integrated into the Home Screen, allowing users to view information at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. To add widgets, users can long-press on the Home Screen, tap the plus (+) button, and choose from available widgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Functionality and Limitations
While a significant addition, widgets in [[new_home_screen_features_in_ios_14 | iOS 14]] have specific limitations compared to Android:
*   **Placement** Widgets cannot be placed anywhere on the Home Screen; they must be aligned to either the left or right side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. A widget cannot be placed alone on the right side without content to its left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Size Customization** Users cannot freely change widget sizes to whatever dimensions they desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, though different predefined sizes are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

Initially, all available widgets in [[new_home_screen_features_in_ios_14 | iOS 14]] are from first-party Apple apps, offering a variety of sizes and functionalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. However, [[thirdparty_widgets_for_ios_14 | third-party widgets]] are expected to be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Examples of anticipated [[thirdparty_widgets_for_ios_14 | third-party widgets]] include a Tesla widget for car controls or a Google Calendar widget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Smart Stacks
A notable feature introduced alongside widgets is the "Smart Stack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Automatic Stacks** A Smart Stack functions as a carousel of several common widgets that can be scrolled manually or change automatically based on predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Custom Smart Stacks** Users can edit Smart Stacks to remove unwanted widgets from the carousel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Even cooler, users can create their own Smart Stacks by dragging two widgets of the same size on top of each other, forming a scrollable stack. More widgets can then be added, and the stack can be configured as a Smart Stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

The integration of widgets is considered the biggest change to the [[new_home_screen_features_in_ios_14 | iOS Home Screen]] in [[new_home_screen_features_in_ios_14 | iOS 14]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. With the introduction of the App Library, it is possible to create an [[new_home_screen_features_in_ios_14 | iOS Home Screen]] setup with no app icons and only a single page of widgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

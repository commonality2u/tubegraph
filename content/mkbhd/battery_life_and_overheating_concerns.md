The iPhone 15 Pro, despite having a new, more powerful chip and slightly larger batteries, has raised concerns regarding its [[battery_life_and_charging | battery life]] and overheating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. The reviewer noted that their extensive testing period was specifically prolonged to investigate these potential issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

## Objective Benchmarks vs. Real-World Use
Objectively, the iPhone 15 Pro models feature slightly larger batteries than their predecessors and incorporate the new three-nanometer A17 Pro chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. In controlled environments, these phones perform better and show longer [[battery_life_and_charging | battery life]] on simple benchmark tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

However, real-world usage has shown inconsistencies. The reviewer experienced a mix of average and "bad draining days," but no "amazing days" with exceptionally long screen-on time, such as nine hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. This contrasts with external reports and headlines suggesting worse [[battery_life_and_charging | battery life]] and overheating issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

## Overheating Incidents
Overheating has been observed, but often in unexpected scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. For instance, the phone remained cool and stable during an outdoor golf tournament in extreme heat (100 degrees Fahrenheit) with max brightness and GPS active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Yet, hours later, while in Airplane Mode on an airplane, merely playing music via Bluetooth and scrolling Instagram, the phone became very hot and rapidly drained 5% [[battery_life_and_charging | battery]] in about five minutes, before returning to normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. This suggests no clear pattern or reason for these random heating spikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

## Potential Causes
The primary theories for these issues point to:
*   **A17 Pro Chip**: The more powerful A17 Pro chip is capable of draining power more quickly in high-intensity settings, such as gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.
*   **iOS 17 Bugs**: Some issues have been attributed to bugs within iOS 17, with updates like 17.0.2 already released and more expected for both iOS and various applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

## Conclusion on Battery Performance
Ultimately, it is anticipated that the [[battery_life_and_charging | battery life]] of the iPhone 15 Pro will largely even out to be similar to that of the previous year's model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

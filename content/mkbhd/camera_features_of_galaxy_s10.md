The [[samsung_galaxy_s10_models_overview | Samsung Galaxy S10]] series, including the S10 and S10+, features significant improvements in its camera systems, marking one of the three main areas of upgrade for these models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Rear Camera System

The Galaxy S10 introduces a triple-camera setup on the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This configuration includes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>:
*   **Main Camera**
    *   12-megapixel sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>
    *   Dual aperture: f/1.5 or f/2.4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>
    *   Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>
*   **Telephoto Camera**
    *   f/2.4 aperture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>

*   **Super Wide Camera**
    *   123-degree field of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>
    *   f/2.2 aperture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>
    *   Does not include OIS, though it is less critical for ultra-wide angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>

Samsung has consistently offered some of the best [[camera_features_and_performance | cameras]] in smartphones, and the expectation is for continued improvement in image quality and color science with the S10 series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Front Camera System

The Galaxy S10 and S10+ feature camera cutouts in the top right corner of the display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Galaxy S10**: Equipped with a single 10-megapixel selfie camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Galaxy S10+**: Features an additional depth sensor alongside the 10-megapixel selfie camera, creating a dual cutout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   Neither model includes an ultra-wide selfie camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Software Enhancements

The camera software incorporates intelligent features:
*   **Seamless Zoom**: Users can seamlessly zoom between the different rear cameras, with the phone automatically switching lenses based on the zoom level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Intelligent Camera**: The system retains an improved scene recognition feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   Overall, the [[camera_performance_and_features | camera department]] is described as a "winning package" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

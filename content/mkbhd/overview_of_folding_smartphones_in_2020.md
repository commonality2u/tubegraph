## The Escobar Fold Series
The Escobar Fold phones gained attention for their unusual branding and claims, leading to an investigation into their legitimacy.

### Escobar Fold (Original)
The first Escobar Fold phone was marketed at $350 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a> and featured a gold accent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Upon closer inspection, it was revealed to be "literally just a Royal FlexPai with a gold accent taped to it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. An order placed on December 5th, 2019, for the Escobar Fold never updated from "pending" or "in production" status and was never received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The company's website was described as "a little suspect" with "pretty wild pictures and statements" and not professional-looking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Escobar Fold 2
Headlines about a new "Escobar Fold 2" surfaced in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This model was priced at $400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Similar to its predecessor, it appeared to be a rebranded existing device: a [[Samsung Galaxy Fold features and design | Samsung Galaxy Fold]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

An email from Escobar Inc. on February 2nd, 2020, inquired about mailing addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The company attempted to guarantee a video review by sending a unit, but this offer was declined due to policies against guaranteeing coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Despite this, a second Escobar Fold 2 was purchased under a different name, bringing the total spent to $750 with no products received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

Unexpectedly, on February 24th, 2020, an Escobar Fold box arrived, stemming from an upgrade of the initial unfulfilled Escobar Fold order to an Escobar Fold 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This upgrade seemed to specifically target tech reviewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

#### Features and Authenticity
The Escobar Fold 2, upon unboxing, was "pretty clear" to be a legitimate [[Features of the updated Galaxy Fold | Samsung Galaxy Fold]], specifically the updated model with dust caps on the hinges and a stiffer hinge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. The gold aesthetic was achieved with "gold tinfoil adhesive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Removing this foil revealed the Samsung logo underneath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. The rebranding job was considered "really poor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Essentially, reviewing an Escobar Fold 2 meant reviewing a [[Samsung Galaxy Fold features and design | Samsung Galaxy Fold]] with a gold sticker and pre-installed mugshot wallpapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

Given that a [[Samsung Galaxy Fold features and design | Galaxy Fold]] cost $1,800 and the Escobar Fold 2 cost $400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>, the theory emerged that Escobar Inc. was selectively shipping phones to YouTubers or tech media personalities who would likely discuss the product, while failing to ship to most other customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. This strategy aimed to generate positive buzz, although it proved unsuccessful in this instance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

#### The Company Behind the Phones
Escobar Inc. involved Roberto Escobar, Pablo Escobar's older brother, and Olaf Gustafson, the CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Gustafson was noted for actively promoting the company through social media, including photos with celebrities and attempts to clone products like Elon Musk's flamethrower and start a cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

The marketing for the Escobar Fold was described as "easily the best part" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Their YouTube channel featured peculiar content:
*   A one-minute video showcasing five fold phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   An unboxing video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   A video titled "Our IP Samsung.com" where original [[Samsung Galaxy Fold features and design | Galaxy Folds]] were smashed with sledgehammers until they caught fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Escobar Inc. even purchased the URL "ripsamsung.com" to redirect to their website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   Endorsement videos from celebrities like Chris Hansen and Anna Anka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. These videos were likely obtained through services like Cameo, where personalized videos can be requested for a fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. It was doubted that these celebrities knew their videos were being used to promote a scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

## Conclusion
The Escobar Fold saga highlighted a scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Due to the high number of unfulfilled orders, purchasing anything from Escobar Inc. is strongly advised against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. While the Escobar Fold 2 is a rebranded [[Samsung Galaxy Fold features and design | Galaxy Fold]], the original [[Samsung Galaxy Fold features and design | Galaxy Fold]] is also not typically recommended due to its high price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra is positioned as a comprehensive device that pushes every valued feature to the max, including its [[camera_features_and_performance | camera features and performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Samsung's Ultra phones have evolved from simply having the most numbers and megapixels to integrating all the best hardware and software in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Camera System Overview
The S24 Ultra features a quad-camera array on its rear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This setup is largely similar to the S23 Ultra, with one significant change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. The system includes:
*   A primary camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>
*   An ultrawide camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>
*   A pair of two different telephoto cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>

Utility-wise, the S24 Ultra's [[camera_enhancements_and_features | camera system]] is described as checking every box, possessing all essential features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### Primary Camera
The primary camera is a 200-megapixel sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Its characteristics include:
*   Consistency and versatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>
*   Great dynamic range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>
*   Quick shooting with fast autofocus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>
*   Default output is 12 megapixels due to pixel binning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   The 200-megapixel mode should generally only be used in incredible lighting conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### Ultrawide Camera
The ultrawide camera is meaningfully wider than the primary camera, making it enjoyable to shoot with despite some distortion near the edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. The automatic macro mode on this camera is considered poor and should be turned off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### Telephoto Cameras
The S24 Ultra includes two telephoto lenses:
*   **3X Telephoto Camera:** This medium-range lens integrates smoothly with the main camera, consistently matching colors and exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **5X Telephoto Camera (New):** This is the main hardware change from the S23 Ultra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. It's a 50-megapixel 5X camera, replacing the previous 10-megapixel 10X camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Although it has a shorter optical zoom range, the increased resolution makes it more powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Photos taken between 5X and 10X zoom appear sharper than on the S23 Ultra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Even 10X photos taken with the new 5X camera (cropped in) can look better than those from the S23 Ultra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. The phone still supports up to 100X zoom for stable pictures of distant objects like the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. The move to a max 5X telephoto lens is also seen in comparison to the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

## Aesthetic and Software Enhancements
While the technical utility is high, the aesthetic output still carries Samsung's characteristic processing: slightly extra contrast, higher exposure, and brighter colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Users might still prefer Pixel or iPhone aesthetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

Beyond raw quality, the S24 Ultra introduces notable [[camera_improvements_and_capabilities | camera enhancements]] through software features:
*   **Default HDR:** All photos are now captured in Google's new Ultra HDR format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. This format tastefully enhances specular highlights and dynamic range differences for a more dramatic look on the phone screen, similar to Pixel and iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This HDR quality is maintained from capture to gallery viewing and social media publishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Social Media Optimization:** Samsung has collaborated with Instagram and Snapchat to provide native quality photo and video upload pipelines, ensuring photos and videos in third-party apps look as good as those captured in the main camera app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

## AI-Powered Photo Editing
The S24 Ultra integrates numerous helpful AI features directly into its Gallery app and editing tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Remaster Button:** This feature automatically adds contrast and brightens photos as needed, providing a solid before-and-after comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   **Erase Reflections:** For photos with glass or windows, a dedicated button appears to erase reflections by allowing the user to circle them. The feature then uses generative fill to show what should actually be in the glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **Add Background Blur:** If a photo contains a recognized subject but wasn't taken in portrait mode, the phone can analyze the subject and add adjustable background blur with a good cutout, effectively creating a portrait shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Magic Editor:** This advanced editor offers extensive generative AI capabilities, similar to Google Pixel's Magic Editor, without apparent restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
    *   **Subject Manipulation:** Users can move subjects around a photo, and the background will be generatively filled in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
    *   **Object Removal:** Unnecessary objects or "photo bombers" can be removed from the foreground or background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
    *   **Horizon Correction with Generative Fill:** When tilting a photo to fix the horizon, the Magic Editor can generatively fill in the new empty areas on the outside of the photo instead of cropping it, preserving more of the original image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
    *   The Magic Editor functions with any photo downloaded to the phone, not just those taken with the camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
    *   Photos altered with Magic Editor receive a watermark with stars in the bottom corner, indicating AI manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. This watermark can be immediately erased using the built-in object removal tool in Samsung's Photo Editor app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
*   **Object Selection for Stickers:** Users can long-press to select an object in a photo, which automatically cuts it out and turns it into a sticker for use in other apps, similar to the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

In practical terms, its front face size is comparable to a Pixel 4 or an [[performance_and_hardware_specifications_of_iphone_5s | iPhone 11 Pro Max]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## Camera System

The camera system is integrated into a vertical strip on the back of the phone, and there is no dedicated front-facing (selfie) camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

*   **Status Bar**: Battery, status bar icons, and notification counters are displayed on the side of the phone instead of the top, cleaning up the main [[screen_and_display_specifications | screen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Charging Animation**: A unique animation fills the entire [[xiaomi_mi_mix_alpha_wraparound_display_concept | wraparound display]] with a liquid-like visual effect when charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   **Notifications**: Notifications also glow around the entire [[screen_and_display_specifications | screen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Quick Access Panel**: A special software mode activates a panel with widgets (e.g., timer, weather) on the back display when the phone is flipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

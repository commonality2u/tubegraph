The [[AirPods Max Usability and First Impressions | AirPods Max]] are Apple's over-ear wireless noise-cancelling headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. They were introduced as an addition to Apple's headphone lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Controls

The [[AirPods Max Usability and First Impressions | AirPods Max]] do not feature touch controls on the earcups, unlike many other wireless headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Instead, they incorporate physical controls:
*   **Digital Crown** Borrowed from the Apple Watch, the Digital Crown allows for volume control by spinning it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. It can also be tapped in to answer calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, double-tapped to skip forward, or triple-tapped to go back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. In iOS 14.3, support is built in to reverse the scrolling direction of the crown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Noise Cancellation Button** An additional button is present for toggling between Transparency Mode and Noise Cancellation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

The physical controls are generally preferred over finicky touch controls found on other headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## Smart Case and Power Management

The [[AirPods Max Usability and First Impressions | AirPods Max]] come with a "Smart Case" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **Power State** There is no on/off button on the headphones themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. Instead, inserting the headphones into the Smart Case triggers a magnetic sensor that detects their presence, putting them into an ultra-low power state to conserve battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. When removed from the case, they instantly wake up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   **Battery Drain** If the headphones are not placed in the Smart Case, they will continue to drain battery for approximately two hours before automatically entering a low power mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## Smart Features and Apple Ecosystem Integration

The [[AirPods Max Usability and First Impressions | AirPods Max]] incorporate several smart features, largely powered by dedicated chips:
*   **Dual H1 Chips** Each earcup contains an H1 chip, enabling significant computing power as music is listened to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Nine Microphones** The headphones feature nine microphones, which are used for noise cancellation and Transparency Mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Noise cancellation is noted to be "right about on par" with [[AirPods Pro design and features | AirPods Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Apple Product Integration** Being Apple headphones, they are designed for seamless use with iPhones and other Apple products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. This integration enables features such as:
    *   Audio Sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>
    *   Siri functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>
    *   Text message reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>
    *   Instant pairing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>

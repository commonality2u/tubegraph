The S-Pen is an integral part of the [[Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10 Plus design and build | Samsung Galaxy Note series]], and it has been refreshed with new features for the [[Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10 Plus design and build | Note 10 and Note 10 Plus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.

## Key Features and Improvements

*   **Screen Off Memo Enhancements** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>:
    *   The notes app now converts your handwriting to text in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.
    *   This text is indexed, allowing users to search for handwritten notes later by typing the word they wrote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. This is described as a "super cool" and "very useful" feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.
*   **New Air Actions for Camera Control** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>:
    *   Users can hold the S-Pen button and swipe to switch between camera modes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.
    *   It's possible to flip between the selfie camera and the back camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.
    *   The S-Pen is also *allegedly* capable of zooming by twirling it clockwise or counterclockwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. However, this specific function was difficult to get working during initial hands-on testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.
    *   These new air actions are generally filed under "gimmicks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.

While some of the new air actions might be perceived as gimmicky, the enhanced "Screen Off Memo" functionality is highlighted as a significant and practical improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.

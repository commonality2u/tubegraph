The only camera missing compared to the [[iPhone 11 Pro cameras | iPhone 11 Pro]] is the third telephoto lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Both included cameras are considered "excellent" and "A-plus smartphone cameras in 2019" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

In April 2019, multiple Samsung Galaxy Fold review units experienced screen failures shortly after being received by reviewers, leading to widespread discussion across social media platforms like Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. These failures occurred around the same time due to separate but related reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Failures Due to Removing the Protective Layer

Several reviewers, including MKBHD and Mark Gurman, experienced screen failures after attempting to remove what appeared to be a pre-installed screen protector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

*   **MKBHD's Experience**
    Upon unboxing his Galaxy Fold, MKBHD observed a thin lip around the inside screen, similar to typical pre-installed screen protectors found on other Samsung phones like the [[Galaxy S10|Galaxy S10]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Assuming it was a removable plastic film, he began peeling it off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Within seconds of peeling, the screen went black, and flickering began in the top left corner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This immediately broke the display, indicating it was not a standard, removable screen protector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Mark Gurman's Experience**
    Mark Gurman also tweeted that his phone came with a layer he believed was a protective film, which he peeled off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. While the screen initially survived the peeling process, it quickly led to the death of the display, which slowly went from half black to completely busted over the next 12 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

It was later clarified that this layer is a "special protective layer" that is "part of the display structure" and designed to protect the screen from unintentional scratches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Removing it or adding adhesives may cause damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

> [00:04:25] **PSA:** If you are one of the few thousand people however many pre-ordered the Galaxy Fold, do not remove that protective film. It might as well be basically part of the screen.

A warning message was later circulated on a T-Mobile unit, stating: "The main screen includes a special protective layer. Peeling that protective layer or using any adhesives on the main screen such as a screen protector or stickers may cause damage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. However, this warning was notably absent from the packaging of initial review units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Failures During Regular Use

Beyond user intervention, other Galaxy Fold units experienced failures through regular use, which raised greater concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

*   **Dieter Bohn (The Verge)**
    Dieter Bohn's [[Galaxy Fold screen issues with screen protector | Galaxy Fold screen broke]] after just one day, despite him not tampering with the protective film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. His unit developed a bulge under the film for an unknown reason, which eventually killed the screen and resulted in stuck pixels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Steve Kovach**
    Steve Kovach also did not interact with the film, but his phone appeared to have sustained some damage, with half of the display "going completely insane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Joanna Stern**
    Even if the protective film is not intentionally peeled, its design with a visible lip means it can collect dust and potentially begin to peel on its own over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Joanna Stern's Galaxy Fold unit, where she resisted the urge to peel the film, still showed signs of the film starting to peel by itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## Samsung's Response

[[Samsungs response to Galaxy Fold problems | Samsung issued a statement]] acknowledging the reports of main display issues on sample units and committed to thoroughly inspecting them to determine the cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. They specifically addressed the issue of reviewers removing the top layer, reiterating that this protective layer is integral to the display's structure and its removal can cause damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Samsung stated they would ensure this information is clearly delivered to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

## Implications for Foldable Phones

The primary culprit behind these [[Common issues and fixes in the Galaxy Fold | screen issues]] is the necessity for a plastic display in a folding phone, which is softer than glass and more susceptible to damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This public relations setback affected not only Samsung but also broader perceptions of [[Implications of Galaxy Fold failures for foldable phones | folding phones in general]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. The durability of such displays, particularly when exposed on the outside like the [[Huawei Mate X|Huawei Mate X]], became a significant concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

Despite these initial hurdles, the tech community remains optimistic for the future of foldable phones, viewing these early challenges as part of the development process for a new form factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. While robots can perform 200,000 folds in testing, real-world human use introduces variables like "user error," moving parts, and lack of water resistance, which contribute to early product failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. The initial release of the Galaxy Fold is seen by some as a "public beta test" from which much can be learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

The LG G Flex is notable for its unique [[lg_g_flex_selfhealing_technology|self-healing]] and [[flexibility_and_structure_of_lg_g_flex|flexible]] design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. These features contribute to the device's overall [[durability_of_lg_g_flex|durability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Self-Healing Backing

The back of the LG G Flex is made from a "velvety" material that is smooth to the touch, similar to the Galaxy S4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This material possesses [[lg_g_flex_selfhealing_technology|self-healing]] properties.

### Official Demonstrations

LG's official videos demonstrated scratching the phone's back with a bronze brush, after which the G Flex completely healed within two minutes, unlike a regular phone that remained scratched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. These experiments were conducted under "optimal controlled conditions," including an air temperature of 27.4 degrees Celsius (81 degrees Fahrenheit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Real-World Testing

When tested against everyday items like keys, the [[lg_g_flex_selfhealing_technology|self-healing]] capability proved effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. After a few minutes, scratches from keys were mostly minimized, becoming "way less noticeable" than when fresh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This feature would be beneficial if the phone were dropped and then returned to a pocket, with scratches barely visible later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Influence of Temperature

The healing process can be accelerated by warming up the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This can be achieved by actions such as clutching the phone to one's body, rubbing it quickly, or playing intensive games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

A deep scratch made with a knife on the device's back showed significant improvement over several hours, being "about halfway gone" and "barely noticeable," which is still superior to traditional phone materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Flexible Design

The "G Flex" in its name refers to its remarkable [[flexibility_and_structure_of_lg_g_flex|flexibility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The phone can be completely flattened from its curved shape without sustaining any internal damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

This [[flexibility_and_structure_of_lg_g_flex|flexing]] capability is maintained despite housing a large 3500 mAh battery, a six-inch display, a processor, RAM, and other standard phone components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. The device's resiliency to [[flexibility_and_structure_of_lg_g_flex|flexing]] is impressive and surpasses that of other curved phones like the Samsung Galaxy Round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

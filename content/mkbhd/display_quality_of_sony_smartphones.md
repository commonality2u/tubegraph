## Display Quality of Sony Smartphones

Sony smartphones, particularly the Sony Xperia One Mark II, feature unique display specifications and capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

### Display Specifications and Features
The [[features_and_specifications_of_sony_xperia_one_mark_ii | Sony Xperia One Mark II]] is equipped with a [[screen_and_display_specifications | 21x9 widescreen display]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This aspect ratio contributes to a narrower and more comfortable feel in the hand, making it more reachable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The design incorporates thin bezels without a hole punch or notch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, which allows the phone to retain front-facing speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

A standout feature is its [[screen_and_display_specifications | 6.5-inch 4K screen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, making it a [[screen_and_display_specifications | 4K 60Hz display]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. The first 4K phone reviewed by MKBHD was also a Sony device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Even in 2020, seeing the 2160p option available for a YouTube video on the phone is notable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, with the display performing comparably to other leading smartphone screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

For optimal visual quality, users are advised to switch to "Creator Mode" within the display settings, which provides the most accurate color and enhances the appearance of videos and photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Criticisms and Market Perception
Despite its advanced [[screen_and_display_specifications | display technology]], the 4K resolution on the Xperia One Mark II may not be immediately apparent to the average user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. It's suggested that most people would not notice the 4K display without being explicitly told <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### Other Sony Display Notes
The successor model, the Xperia 5 Mark II, is a slightly smaller version of the Xperia One Mark II and features a [[screen_and_display_specifications | 120Hz display]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

The [[design_and_display_of_iphone_11_pro | iPhone 11 Pro]] and [[design_and_display_of_iphone_11_pro | iPhone 11 Pro Max]] are Apple's new flagship iPhones, marking the departure from Roman numerals in their names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. These devices are positioned as premium options, starting at $999 and $1099 respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Design Overview

The overall design of the [[design_and_display_of_iphone_11_pro | iPhone 11 Pro]] is almost identical to the iPhone Xs and Xs Max, maintaining the same physical sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Key updates include the display, battery, cameras, and notably, a new matte finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Matte Finish and Colors

One of the most noticeable changes is the new matte finish on the back glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This frosted glass has a very slight texture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. In contrast, the camera square retains a glossy finish, which is the opposite of the cheaper [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 11]], which features a glossy phone body with a matte camera square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. While the reviewer wished the entire back of the Pro model was matte, the new finish is highly praised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

The available colors include:
*   Matte Space Gray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>
*   Midnight Green (a subtle, dark green, almost military camo type) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>
*   Silver (very bright) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>
*   Gold (the most familiar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>

There is no matte black option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The durability of the matte finish against scratches is yet to be determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Display

The [[iphone_11_pro_display_features | iPhone 11 Pro display features]] are an improvement over the iPhone Xs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. While it does not feature a 120Hz high refresh rate ProMotion display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, it is brighter, reaching a peak brightness of 1200 nits and boasting a 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. It retains the same resolution OLED, sizes, and notch as previous models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

3D Touch has been removed and replaced with haptic presses (long presses instead of pressure-sensitive ones), which perform most of the same functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Apple calls this new display the "Super Retina Display XDR" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Camera System

The [[design_and_display_of_iphone_11_pro | iPhone 11 Pro]] and [[design_and_display_of_iphone_11_pro | iPhone 11 Pro Max]] feature a new triple-camera system on the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This setup includes:
*   One normal camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>
*   One 2x telephoto camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>
*   One 120-degree ultra-wide camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>

Users can switch between these cameras using buttons or a slider that gracefully moves between focal lengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Apple aimed to match the quality across all three cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. All three cameras support 4K 60fps video recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Portrait mode can now be used with either the telephoto or the normal camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. The appearance of the camera module has been likened to a "kitchen stove" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

## Durability and Other Features

The [[design_and_display_of_iphone_11_pro | iPhone 11 Pro]] includes slightly improved water resistance and more shatter-resistant glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Face ID has also seen minor improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

> [!warning] "Pro" Naming Concerns
> The reviewer expresses mixed feelings about the "Pro" designation, suggesting that while the phone is highly capable, it lacks features typically associated with professional-grade devices that could justify the name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Expected "pro" features that are missing include:
> *   Reverse wireless charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>
> *   High refresh rate ProMotion display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>
> *   USB-C port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>
> *   Apple Pencil support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>
> *   In-display fingerprint reader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>
> *   Special "Pro" software features, unlike iPadOS on the iPad Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>
> *   Camera settings integrated directly into the camera app, rather than buried in the Settings app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>

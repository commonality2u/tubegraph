### Inside the Headset Box

The main headset box is designed like a shoebox, featuring pull tabs for opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Inside, the [[Apple Vision Pro features and specifications | headset]] is presented with a protective cover and the Solo Knit Band pre-attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## [[components_and_accessories_of_apple_vision_pro | Accessories]] Overview

### Documentation and Care

The box includes a booklet explaining what's in the box, initial pairing with an iPhone, and how to connect straps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. It also provides instructions on how to properly wrap the battery cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The polishing cloth is essential for maintaining the clean glass front of the headset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

### Light Seal Customization

Users undergo a face scanning process using an iPhone's Face ID sensors to measure depth around the eyes and face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. This ensures a custom-fitted Light Seal, which is designed to block out light and roughly match the user's face shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. The Light Seal Cushion, which attaches magnetically similar to AirPods Max headphone covers, can be switched between a thin or thick version for desired comfort or distance from the face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

### Head Bands

The [[Apple Vision Pro features and specifications | Vision Pro]] comes with two types of bands, with sizes (small, medium, large) customized based on head measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>:

*   **Solo Knit Band**: This soft, stretchy fabric band is seen in most commercials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. It wraps around the back of the head, with a crank mechanism to tighten it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. However, it places all the headset's weight on the front, resting on the cheeks and forehead, which can be uncomfortable for prolonged use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   **Dual Loop Band**: This band goes both around the back and over the top of the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. It attaches similarly to the Solo Knit Band but uses Velcro for adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. This design offers much better weight distribution, making the headset more comfortable for longer wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

Bands are easily detachable from the headset using an orange pull tab to release the metal clicks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. The headset itself is dense and front-weighted, containing all the computer components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

### Battery and Charging

The external battery provides approximately two and a half to three hours of use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. It connects to the left side of the headset via a proprietary circular connector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. The battery unit also features a USB-C port, allowing it to be plugged directly into the wall for charging or continuous power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. The included 30-watt wall brick and C-to-C braided cable are used for charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

### [[components_and_accessories_of_apple_vision_pro | Travel Case]]

The optional [[components_and_accessories_of_apple_vision_pro | Travel Case]] (an additional $200) is a protective outer layer for the headset, especially considering its glass exterior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. It features a handle, molded compartments for the headset, battery, and cable, and an accessory pouch for the polishing cloth, power brick, and charging cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. This case is considered essential for traveling with the [[Apple Vision Pro features and specifications | Vision Pro]], particularly for uses like on airplanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

## First-Time Setup Process

To boot up the [[Apple Vision Pro features and specifications | Vision Pro]] for the first time, follow these steps:

1.  **Retrieve Components**: Take out the battery, headset, selected Light Seal Cushion (thin or thick), and preferred head band (Solo Knit or Dual Loop) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
2.  **Connect Battery**: Locate the proprietary circular connector on the left side of the headset and align the dot on the battery cable with the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. Twist the connector to secure it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.
3.  **Power On**: Once connected, the connector will glow, indicating the headset is starting up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. It takes approximately one minute to boot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
4.  **Zeiss Lens Attachment (if applicable)**: If you have a prescription, attach the magnetic Zeiss lenses to the inside of the headset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. Prices are approximately $100 for readers and $150 for prescription lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. After attachment, scan the code on the lenses with the headset to allow it to adjust accordingly for your prescription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

After booting, the device will present a "hello" script and proceed into the initial setup process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. Further details on the complete [[user_experience_and_eye_tracking_with_apple_vision_pro | setup]] and [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | usage]] of the [[Apple Vision Pro features and specifications | Vision Pro]] will be covered in subsequent articles.

The pricing strategy of the iPhone has significantly influenced the smartphone market over the years, from setting initial high benchmarks to reacting to competition and establishing new premium tiers.

## Early Pricing and Market Presence

When the original iPhone was unveiled on January 9, 2007, it launched with a starting price of $499 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. This was considered "pretty expensive for a phone" at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. Despite its cost, the original iPhone had a substantial [[impact_on_the_smartphone_market|impact on the smartphone market]] due to its groundbreaking features, which were "better than what was out on the market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

Subsequent models like the iPhone 5s continued this trend, launching at $649, which was "definitely expensive at the time" but positioned as a flagship device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>.

## Response to Competition: The Cheaper iPhone

The introduction of the iPhone 5c alongside the 5s demonstrated Apple's response to growing market pressures. The 5c was a "much cheaper and a much more colorful option" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>. Initially priced at $99 with a contract (compared to the 5s at $199 with a contract) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>, this move showed the "pressure that Apple was feeling from the Android world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>. With many cheaper phones entering the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>, offering a more affordable iPhone became a necessity to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>.

Later, the iPhone SE (2nd generation) further solidified Apple's presence in the budget segment. Launched at a $399 starting price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:20:00">[26:20:00]</a>, it highlighted "how inflated the prices have become" for premium models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:27:00">[26:27:00]</a>. This model was Apple's "offering for competing in the budget area where so many others are kicking their butts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:30:00">[26:30:00]</a>.

## The $1,000 Threshold and its Ramifications

A pivotal moment in [[price_versus_value_in_smartphones|smartphone pricing]] occurred with the launch of the iPhone X (often referred to as iPhone 10) in 2017. This model marked the "true beginning of the future of the iPhone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:33:00">[20:33:00]</a>, featuring a significant redesign and the removal of the home button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:45:00">[20:45:00]</a>. However, its most impactful contribution to the market was its price tag: $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:14:00">[21:14:00]</a>.

Historically, iPhone prices had seen slow increases, from $459 to $799 for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a>. The iPhone X's base configuration of 64 GB storage "just jumped right up to the top" at $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:38:00">[21:38:00]</a>. This sparked a reaction of "What? You can do that? You can charge a thousand dollars for a phone and people will actually buy it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:43:00">[21:43:00]</a>.

Indeed, people did buy the iPhone X, and this success "opened Pandora's box for everyone else" in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:57:00">[21:57:00]</a>. It demonstrated that companies could create "crazy high-end spec phones" and sell them at premium prices, generating significantly more profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:02:00">[22:02:00]</a>. This pricing strategy led to an industry-wide trend of higher-end smartphone pricing.

## Continued Price Inflation and Market Saturation

The trend of increasing prices continued with models like the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max, which introduced a "pro" naming convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:52:00">[24:52:00]</a>. This strategy of playing with names and features like "better screens, better cameras, better features, better batteries" allowed Apple to "upsell" their products for more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:34:00">[25:34:00]</a>. As of 2021, the most expensive iPhone available is $1,599 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:13:00">[32:13:00]</a>.

While iPhone sales saw a "really big surge" from 2011 to 2015, partly driven by models like the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus (the best-selling iPhones and likely best-selling smartphones of all time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:29:00">[32:29:00]</a>, sales have since begun "plateauing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:44:00">[32:44:00]</a>. This saturation in the smartphone market has led Apple to focus on growing other revenue streams, such as services and accessories related to the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:46:00">[32:46:00]</a>.

Despite rising prices, Apple boasts over a billion active iPhones in use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:26:00">[29:26:00]</a>.

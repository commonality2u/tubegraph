The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro introduced a new, smaller unboxing experience, leading to some controversy regarding included accessories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Box Contents

The new iPhone boxes are roughly half their usual volume and height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Inside, the iPhone is placed face down at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

The contents of both the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro boxes are identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>:
*   The iPhone itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>
*   A [[usbc_integration_in_iphones|USB-C]] to Lightning cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
*   Paperwork, including a product red sheet (for the Product Red model), a SIM card removal tool, and a single white Apple sticker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>

Notably, there is **no wall charging brick** and **no headphones** included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Controversy: Absence of Charging Brick

The exclusion of the charging brick from the box has been a point of controversy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Apple's Defense
Apple's official reasoning for removing the charging brick is cited as an environmental benefit, aiming to reduce the number of chargers and materials shipped that might end up in landfills, as many people already own charging bricks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### Implications of the USB-C Cable
Despite Apple's defense, the charging cable included with the iPhone 12 is a [[usbc_integration_in_iphones|USB-C]] to Lightning cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This presents a challenge because the wall bricks that most iPhone users already own are older USB-A models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Only those who purchased the iPhone 11 Pro or later models would likely possess a [[usbc_integration_in_iphones|USB-C]] wall brick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

Consequently, most iPhone 12 buyers who only have USB-A wall bricks will need to purchase a new [[usbc_integration_in_iphones|USB-C]] wall brick separately, which Apple conveniently sells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

### USB-C Port vs. Cable
While the iPhone 12 includes a [[usbc_integration_in_iphones|USB-C]] to Lightning cable, the phone itself retains the Lightning port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Some believe the design would have been enhanced with a [[usbc_integration_in_iphones|USB-C]] port at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## MagSafe Charging System
The new iPhones incorporate [[magsafe_charging_system|MagSafe]], which involves magnets embedded in the back of the phone's wireless charging coil for compatible accessories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. The [[magsafe_charging_system|MagSafe]] charger is a thin, hockey-puck-shaped device with a [[usbc_integration_in_iphones|USB-C]] connector at the other end of its three-foot cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. This [[magsafe_charging_system|MagSafe]] charger magnetically attaches to the back of the iPhone, centered over the Apple logo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. When connected, an NFC chip inside the charger triggers a circular [[magsafe_charging_system|MagSafe]] charging animation on the iPhone's screen, indicating it's charging at 15 watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

It is possible to charge through a compatible [[magsafe_charging_system|MagSafe]] case, which also features internal magnetic coils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. However, charging through multiple layers, such as a [[magsafe_charging_system|MagSafe]] wallet and a case simultaneously, is not supported, although the magnetic connection still holds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

Despite the specific alignment magnets, the [[magsafe_charging_system|MagSafe]] magnets are described as "a little loose," raising questions about their strength for applications like car mounts or securely attaching accessories like the [[magsafe_charging_system|MagSafe]] wallet, which can easily slide off when placed in a pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. The [[magsafe_charging_system|MagSafe]] charger is technically a Qi wireless charger and can magnetize and wirelessly charge other Android phones that support Qi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

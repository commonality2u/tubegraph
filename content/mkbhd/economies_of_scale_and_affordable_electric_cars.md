Tesla's strategy to make electric vehicles more accessible relies heavily on achieving [[improvements_and_efficiency_in_teslas_production | economies of scale]] and continuous technological advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. The automotive industry is described as "insanely competitive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>, making the goal of affordability particularly challenging.

## The Path to Affordability

Making cars affordable is a "really tough" challenge for Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. The primary method to achieve this is through high volume production, which enables greater [[improvements_and_efficiency_in_teslas_production | economies of scale]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. Established car companies currently benefit from significantly better economies of scale due to their larger production volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. As Tesla's production volume gradually increases, they anticipate being able to progressively reduce the cost per vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

Elon Musk explains that achieving affordability requires a combination of:
*   **Design and Technology Improvements** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>
*   **Scale** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>

This concept is likened to the evolution of mobile phones, where early, bulky, expensive models with limited functionality became affordable and highly capable over time through numerous design and engineering iterations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. Each successive design iteration allows for more capability, better integration, and improved production methods, leading to products that are both better and cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.

> "It's like a natural progression of any new technology that it takes multiple versions and a large volume in order to make it affordable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.

## Current and Future Affordability Goals

The company's primary focus is on making the product as compelling as possible, relying on word-of-mouth for sales rather than advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. Tesla aims to make cars available to a wide range of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

The [[comparison_to_other_tesla_models_and_conventional_pickup_trucks | Model 3]] has seen a significant number of trade-ins from owners of more affordable vehicles like the Prius, which costs around $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. This indicates a demand for more affordable electric options.

Tesla believes it can eventually produce a $25,000 car, potentially within three years if they "work really hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. This requires not only scaling production but also significant [[improvements_and_efficiency_in_teslas_production | design and technology improvements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.

## Strategic Product Development

Tesla's initial "master plan" involved moving from low-volume, high-priced vehicles (like the first Roadster) to higher-volume, lower-priced models (like the Model S and [[comparison_to_other_tesla_models_and_conventional_pickup_trucks | Model 3]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>. The Model X was acknowledged as a deviation that delayed their mission to advance electric vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:13:00">[16:13:00]</a>.

Going forward, Tesla aims to develop multiple products simultaneously to accelerate the shift to electric vehicles. They are strategically focusing on producing two products at a time, moving beyond their previous one-product-at-a-time approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:24:00">[17:24:00]</a>. This includes the compact SUV [[innovations_and_future_products_from_tesla | Model Y]] (comparable in price to the [[comparison_to_other_tesla_models_and_conventional_pickup_trucks | Model 3]]), a semi-truck, a pickup truck, and the next-generation Roadster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. If successful with two simultaneous projects, they may attempt three, although this remains a significant [[challenges_and_strategies_in_teslas_production | challenge]] compared to manufacturers producing a dozen models at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>.

Throughout its history, the iPhone has faced various controversies and design challenges, often leading to public discussion and changes in subsequent models.

## Early iPhone Challenges

### Original iPhone Limitations
The [[differences_between_original_and_current_iphones | original iPhone]], while revolutionary, had several limitations at launch. Its recessed headphone jack often prevented non-Apple headphones from working properly [00:02:20]. Crucially, it launched without an App Store, meaning users were limited to the included applications like Safari, YouTube, and Google Maps [00:02:38]. Additionally, users could not set a custom wallpaper, with all non-jailbroken original iPhones displaying a pitch-black background [00:02:52].

### iPhone 3GS Heat Discoloration
The white version of the iPhone 3GS experienced discoloration issues due to heat [00:05:56]. Apple's initial recommendation was for users to avoid leaving their phone in a car in the sun or using it for extended periods on a hot day [00:06:04].

## Design and Structural Issues

### iPhone 4 "Antennagate"
The iPhone 4, despite its highly praised design, became the source of "Antennagate," Apple's biggest controversy at the time [00:08:04]. The phone's external stainless steel band, which housed new antennas, caused a noticeable drop in signal strength, sometimes even dropping calls, when gripped in a way that covered the antenna bands [00:08:10]. Apple initially stated that the issue wasn't "that bad," attributing it to a flawed signal bar calculation that would be fixed with a software update, and advised users not to hold their phone in that manner [00:08:34]. Eventually, Apple provided a free bumper case to every iPhone 4 buyer to mitigate the issue [00:08:48].

### iPhone 5 Apple Maps Launch
With the iPhone 5, Apple replaced the pre-loaded Google Maps app with its own Apple Maps, which was widely criticized for being "absolutely terrible" at launch [00:10:36].

### iPhone 6/6 Plus "Bendgate"
The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus faced "Bendgate," a durability issue where the thin design of the phones, particularly the larger iPhone 6 Plus, made them susceptible to bending under pressure [00:14:44]. This was notably demonstrated in videos showing the phone bending straight in half [00:14:50]. This indicated that it was Apple's first time making a phone of that size, and it needed structural reinforcement [00:14:59].

### iPhone 6S/6S Plus Battery Size
The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus had a smaller battery compared to the previous year's models [00:16:17]. This was due to the internal space taken up by the new reinforced 7000 series aluminum and the introduction of 3D Touch technology [00:16:20].

## Feature Removals and Pricing

### iPhone 7/7 Plus Headphone Jack Removal
The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are particularly memorable for the removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack in September 2016 [00:18:44]. Apple famously justified this as "courage" on stage [00:18:51]. Other smartphone manufacturers initially mocked Apple for this decision [00:19:00], but the simultaneous announcement of AirPods led to their widespread popularity, shifting the entire landscape of smartphone audio [00:19:07]. The Jet Black finish also, while visually appealing, was prone to fingerprints and scratches [00:19:28].

### iPhone X Price Tag
The iPhone X marked a significant shift in pricing, launching with a starting price tag of $1,000 [00:21:14]. This set a new precedent in the smartphone market, demonstrating that consumers were willing to pay a premium for high-end devices, influencing other manufacturers to follow suit with their own high-priced flagship models [00:21:40]. The iPhone X was also the fastest discontinued iPhone model, lasting only 10 months before being axed upon the release of the 10S [00:22:14].

### iPhone 10R Display Resolution
The iPhone 10R, positioned as a more affordable option, was criticized for its "incredibly low resolution 720p LCD" display, especially given its $750 price point [00:23:26].

### Persistent Notch Design
Since the iPhone X, the iPhone's notch design has remained consistent, while competitors have moved to smaller cutouts like hole-punches or even hidden under-screen camera technology by the time of the iPhone 11 release [00:24:30]. This has made the iPhone's design appear less cutting-edge in terms of screen-to-body ratio.

## Modern Day Issues

### Delayed Feature Delivery
A recurring trend seen with the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 lineups is the announcement of new camera features on stage that are not available at launch, but rather delivered months later via software updates [00:27:31]. Examples include ProRAW for the iPhone 12 [00:27:43] and ProRes video for the iPhone 13 Pro models [00:28:59].

### Removal of Accessories from Box
The iPhone 12 lineup is notable for shipping in smaller boxes that no longer included charging bricks [00:27:54]. While initially mocked by other manufacturers, this move has since been adopted by companies like Samsung and Xiaomi, suggesting it may become the new norm in the smartphone industry [00:28:06].

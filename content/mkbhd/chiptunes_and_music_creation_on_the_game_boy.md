The [[Sound quality and performance | Game Boy]]'s unique [[Sound quality and performance | sound quality and performance]] has transcended its original gaming purpose, giving rise to an entire musical genre known as Chiptunes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

## The Birth of Chiptunes

While other portable gaming consoles of its era boasted color screens and louder displays, the [[Sound quality and performance | Game Boy]] was intentionally designed with "lateral innovation by withered technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a> in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. This philosophy meant utilizing mature technology that was well-understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. Consequently, the [[Sound quality and performance | Game Boy]] featured very simple audio capabilities, producing only "basic bloops and bleeps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.

Despite these limitations, this distinct lo-fi sound became iconic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. It unexpectedly blossomed into a whole new music genre loved by many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.

## Creating Music on the Game Boy

Chiptunes is the art of creating music primarily by utilizing the sound chips found in old video game systems like the [[Sound quality and performance | Game Boy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

The [[Sound quality and performance | Game Boy]] contains a specific chip dedicated solely to music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. However, it can only play four notes simultaneously, making it "incredibly limiting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. Furthermore, the [[Sound quality and performance | Game Boy]]'s internal memory is so small that it can only manage a song around eight kilobytes in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. To put this in perspective, one Chiptune song is approximately 500 times smaller than a compressed MP3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.

Despite these severe constraints, artists have managed to create "really insane compositions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. Marques Brownlee, in an exploration of [[Retro technology in modern content | retro technology]], attempted to compose a Chiptune song with the help of artist Storm Blooper, even with limited experience in music creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.

Marques noted:
> "I definitely didn't expect you could squeeze music this fresh out of tech this old." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>

## Audio Accessories

Some [[Game Boy accessories and their relevance | Game Boy accessories]] were designed to enhance the audio experience. The "Handy Boy by STD" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a> (a third-party accessory) featured built-in speakers that provided significantly louder audio than the [[Sound quality and performance | Game Boy]]'s internal speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. This accessory was deemed "dope" for its ability to improve the [[Sound quality and performance | Game Boy]]'s sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

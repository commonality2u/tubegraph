The [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | Apple Vision Pro]] is a first-generation augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) headset from Apple, designed as a standalone computer with its own Wi-Fi connection and an M2 chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>. It runs on a new operating system called Vision OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:04">[08:32:04]</a>. The headset is controlled entirely by a user's hands, eyes, and voice, without external controllers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:02">[01:48:02]</a>.

Initially, only Apple's own apps will be available on the home screen, similar to the first iPhone before the App Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:52">[07:49:52]</a>. The headset's early announcement, with its release slated for early next year, provides a window for developers to create new [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | applications]] and functionalities for the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:02">[07:58:02]</a>.

## Core Functions and Applications

The [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | applications and ecosystem of Apple Vision Pro]] can be broadly categorized into computing, content, and connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.

### Computing
The [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_specifications | Apple Vision Pro]] can function as a standalone computer, allowing for web browsing and other tasks within multiple 4K windows that can be moved around and interacted with using hand gestures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. The [[user_experience_and_interface_of_apple_vision_pro | user experience and interface of Apple Vision Pro]] for computing is highly responsive; scrolling through Safari windows or resizing them can be done by touching fingers together in the air and dragging, with near real-time feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.

A notable feature is its integration with the Mac ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. Users with a Mac can simply look at their computer while wearing the headset, and the Vision Pro will mirror the Mac's display as one of its 4K windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>. A Bluetooth keyboard and trackpad can then be connected for a full Mac experience with a larger, virtual screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>.

### Connections
The headset supports messaging, allowing users to type messages similar to a Mac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | FaceTime]] is also integrated, with participants appearing as floating windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>.
A unique aspect of FaceTime on the Vision Pro is that other participants will see a 3D rendered model of the user, scanned from their iPhone, which syncs with facial movements and eye tracking from the headset's sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>. While functional, this 3D persona may fall into an "uncanny valley" compared to an actual person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>.

### Content Consumption

The [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_specifications | Apple Vision Pro]] is poised to significantly impact the VR content industry, leveraging Apple's brand to attract content creators, motion picture studios, and sports leagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>.

*   **Immersive VR Experiences**: Users can watch an NBA game Courtside in the headset, with the quality being good enough to be an appealing alternative to attending in person, potentially at a price point of $10-20 per game or via subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>.
*   **2D Movie Watching**: Regular 2D movies can be watched as if in a private theater for one, by simply sitting back and putting on the headset, possibly with headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>.
*   **Immersion Control**: The digital crown on the side of the headset allows users to adjust their level of immersion. Turning it clockwise increases envelopment in the VR environment, while turning it counterclockwise brings in more of the real-world environment through pass-through in the peripheral vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>.

### 3D Photos and Videos

The headset features cameras that can capture 3D photos and videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>. The two front-facing cameras allow for stereoscopic 3D recording, enabling users to record immersive videos and then relive those moments in 3D when watching them back in the headset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>. However, the concept of recording memories while wearing a large headset raises concerns about the social implications, drawing comparisons to the issues faced by Google Glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>.

## Target Audience

The [[pricing_and_potential_market_for_apple_vision_pro | Apple Vision Pro]], with its starting [[pricing_and_potential_market_for_apple_vision_pro | price of $3,500]] and "Pro" designation, is clearly not a product for the masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a>. It is intended for early adopters and developers, who will play a crucial role in shaping the direction and future [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | applications]] of the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:46:00">[18:46:00]</a>. It is viewed as a "rich person's toy and the developer's muse" for now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:23:00">[19:23:00]</a>.

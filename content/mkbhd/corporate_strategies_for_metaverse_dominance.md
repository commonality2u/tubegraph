[[meta_and_the_metaverse | Meta]] (formerly Facebook) is strategically investing heavily in the metaverse to establish dominance in what it perceives as the next iteration of the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This pivot comes as Meta's stock has seen a significant decline, with a drop of over 60% in a year, and Facebook's growth has flatlined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The company has acknowledged that its market saturation and external factors, such as the iPhone's "ask app not to track" feature, have significantly impacted its core ads business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Recognizing this "slow decline," Meta is shifting its focus to [[developments_and_future_expectations_for_vr_and_ar | Virtual Reality (VR)]] and [[developments_and_future_expectations_for_vr_and_ar | Augmented Reality (AR)]] to regain control over the digital landscape and associated revenue streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Investment and Development Strategy
Meta's strategy involves pouring billions of dollars into its metaverse division to control as much of this future as possible, encompassing software, hardware, and advertising platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Hardware Development
The company's commitment is exemplified by products like the Meta Quest Pro headset, priced at $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Technologically, the Quest Pro is noted for its comfort due to a balanced design that distributes components (displays/lenses in front, battery in back) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Key specifications include a custom Snapdragon xr2+ processor, 256GB of storage, 12GB of RAM, and slim displays offering 1920x1800 resolution per eye at up to 90 FPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. It features full-color pass-through capabilities via 10 external sensors and cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, and new Touch Pro controllers with their own cameras and sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Internal sensors enable advanced face and eye tracking, allowing avatars to mirror user expressions in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Although the current headset is bulky with a battery life of about 1.5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, Meta envisions future versions becoming much smaller, eventually resembling regular glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

### Software and Application Development
Meta's overarching plan is to replicate real-world and internet activities within [[meta_and_the_metaverse | VR]] environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, aiming to make the virtual versions superior to their non-VR counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

*   **Gaming:** Recognizing the existing VR gaming market, Meta is investing to entice developers, aiming for a broader variety of games and improved fidelity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **Virtual Meetings & Collaboration:** Meta has developed virtual meeting room experiences that support video conferencing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Features include spatial audio, breakout rooms, and immersive presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. While current avatars are customizable but rudimentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>, Meta has demonstrated "live avatars" that use phone scans to create photorealistic virtual representations of users, complete with face and eye tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This aims to enable nuanced interactions like eye contact and private side conversations, surpassing current Zoom call limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   **Remote Work and Virtual Offices:** Meta plans to create entire virtual office buildings for global collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. The Quest Pro offers native Mac support, allowing users to project their computer screens onto multiple large virtual displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. Meta is also partnering with companies like Microsoft to integrate Office 365 into work rooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a> and has supplied thousands of headsets to companies like Accenture to encourage virtual work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
*   **Acquisitions:** Meta actively acquires VR companies and studios, making it a common pathway for VR tech startups to be acquired by the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

## Concerns Regarding Centralized Control
A significant concern raised is the potential for one company to control the entire foundation of this "second-generation internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Meta aims to build this new foundation and control everything that grows on top of it, from work rooms to games and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. While other companies like Pico, Google, and potentially Apple are also developing VR/AR technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>, Meta's aggressive investment and acquisitions position it uniquely to push the technology into the mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. The potential for this level of centralized control, especially concerning practices like using eye-tracking for targeted advertising, raises [[concerns_over_centralized_control_of_virtual_environments | privacy and control issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. The argument is that true competition fosters better innovation for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

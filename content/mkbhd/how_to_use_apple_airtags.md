Despite the video's title, the provided transcript contains extremely garbled speech and does not offer clear instructions or details on how to use Apple AirTags.

There are mentions of "find my friends" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, "find my way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, and "find my friends" services around iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. The transcript also mentions "iPhone" in various contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>, and "find What My Dark art on trains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

The phrase "international airtightness" is mentioned, which may vaguely refer to AirTags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

There is a mention of [[Apple AirTags features|Apple catalasem]] (likely "Apple AirTags") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a> and [[Apples new AirPods and AirPods Pro features|iPhone Android iPhone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, but no specific usage instructions are discernible from the provided text.

The audio primarily consists of music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, and distorted speech that appears to be a misinterpretation of foreign language or background noise rather than coherent English instructions on using Apple AirTags.

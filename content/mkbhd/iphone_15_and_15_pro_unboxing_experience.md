## iPhone 15 and 15 Plus Unboxing

Starting with the [[iPhone 15 and 15 Pro major changes | iPhone 15]] and [[iPhone 15 and 15 Pro major changes | 15 Plus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>:

*   **Colors**
    *   **Blue:** The new blue color on the [[iPhone 15 and 15 Pro major changes | iPhone 15]] is described as "barely blue" due to its very subtle hint of blue, visible even on the side rails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
    *   **Yellow:** The [[iPhone 15 and 15 Pro major changes | iPhone 15 Plus]] features an "incredibly pale yellow" color, which appeared more colorful under perfect lighting at the Apple event but seems extremely pale in other settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
    *   Overall, the colors across the board for these models are "really subtle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Box Contents**
    *   The box includes paperwork and a single white Apple sticker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
    *   Notably, there is no SIM card ejector tool, as iPhones in the US are now all eSIM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max Unboxing

The [[iPhone 15 Pro design and build changes | Pro phones]] also come in white boxes but feature dark wallpapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>:

*   **Colors**

    *   **Natural Titanium:** The [[iPhone 15 Pro design and build changes | iPhone 15 Pro Max]] is offered in a new Natural Titanium color, which is considered the "best color in person in the hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## New Braided USB-C Cable

A significant change across all [[iPhone 15 and 15 Pro major changes | new iPhones]] is the inclusion of a single, white, braided USB-C to USB-C cable in the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This is reportedly the first time an iPhone has shipped with a braided cable, which is expected to be of higher quality and more durable than previous cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

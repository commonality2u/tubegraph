Samsung introduced three main phones in 2019: the Samsung Galaxy S10, the Galaxy S10 Plus, and the Galaxy S10e <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. These devices maintain familiar Samsung characteristics while introducing distinct differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Later, a Galaxy S10 5G model was also revealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## Samsung Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus

The Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus are presented as Samsung's flagship phones for 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. They feature a refined aesthetic, described as "quite nice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

Key improvements in these models focus on the display, fingerprint sensor, and cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Display Improvements

The Galaxy S10 features a 6.1-inch display, while the S10 Plus has a 6.4-inch display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Samsung continues its tradition of having top-tier displays, now boasting a 90+ percent screen-to-body ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The resolution remains super high with a 19:9 tall aspect ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The display is HDR10+ certified and is referred to as a "next-level Infinity Display," extending to the very edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

A prominent feature is the camera cutout in the top right corner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This is a laser-cut hole in the AMOLED panel for precise camera integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The Galaxy S10 has a single 10-megapixel selfie camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The S10 Plus features an additional depth sensor for a dual cutout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Samsung includes wallpapers that are slightly dark in the top right corner and a fancy animation around the cutout when switching to the front-facing camera to make the hole less distracting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Fingerprint Sensor

The Galaxy S10 series incorporates an ultrasonic under-the-glass fingerprint reader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Unlike optical sensors that shine a light, ultrasonic sensors are faster, do not require a bright light, and can read fingerprints before waking up the display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### [[camera_features_of_galaxy_s10 | Camera Features]]

The Galaxy S10 now features a triple-camera setup on the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This includes three different focal lengths: a main camera, a telephoto lens, and a super-wide-angle lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

Specifications of the rear cameras:
*   **Main Camera**: 12-megapixel sensor with dual aperture (f/1.5 or f/2.4) and Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Telephoto Lens**: f/2.4 aperture with OIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Ultra-wide Lens**: 123-degree field of view, f/2.2 aperture, and does not have OIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

The software enables seamless zooming between cameras, automatically switching based on the zoom level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. It also includes an intelligent camera with improved scene recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

### [[battery_and_storage_options_in_galaxy_s10 | Battery and Storage]]

The batteries in the S10 and S10 Plus are significantly larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>:
*   **Galaxy S10**: 3,400 mAh battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Galaxy S10 Plus**: 4,100 mAh battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

Both models feature the Snapdragon 855 processor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Galaxy S10**: Starts at $900 with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage, with an option for 8GB RAM and 512GB storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Galaxy S10 Plus**: Starts at $1000 with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Higher-end S10 Plus models can feature a ceramic back instead of glass and offer configurations up to 8GB RAM with 512GB storage, or a 1TB model with 12GB RAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

All Samsung phones also include expandable storage via microSD, allowing for up to 1.5 terabytes of total memory (1TB internal + 0.5TB microSD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

### General Features

The Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus retain many signature Samsung features:
*   **IP68 Water and Dust Resistance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>
*   **Fast Charging and Fast Wireless Charging** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>
*   **Headphone Jack** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>
*   **Wi-Fi 6** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>
*   **Bixby Button** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>
*   **Wireless Power Share (Reverse Wireless Charging)**: This feature allows the S10 to wirelessly charge other devices, like the new Galaxy Buds, at 4.5 watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. While functional, it is considered somewhat gimmicky for phones and more practical for accessories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

The phones are available in new colors, including green, and feature glass backs that show fingerprints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. They run Samsung's new One UI, which reorganizes menu items and quick toggles to the bottom of the display for easier reach on larger phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

## Samsung Galaxy S10e

The Galaxy S10e is positioned as Samsung's answer to the iPhone 10R <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. It has some trade-offs, such as a regular fingerprint sensor and a slightly smaller display, to achieve a lower price point of $750 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

## Samsung Galaxy S10 5G

The Galaxy S10 5G is described as a larger S10 with a 6.7-inch screen and a significantly larger battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. It is expected to have an even higher price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. At its reveal, it was not fully functional or available to hold, suggesting it might have been a model rather than a working device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. It was anticipated for release in Q2 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

The [[Apple Card unboxing and design features | Apple Card]], a titanium credit card announced at an Apple services event, is designed primarily as an extension of Apple Pay for iPhone users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. It allows users to make purchases in places that don't accept Apple Pay while still integrating with the Apple Wallet app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## Activation and Setup
To activate the [[Apple Card unboxing and design features | Apple Card]], users wake their iPhone and hold it near the bottom of the physical card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. The activation process appears in [[ios_on_iphone_x_and_its_functionality | iOS]] similarly to pairing AirPods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Once activated, the card is added to the Wallet app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Wallet App Functionality
The Wallet app provides several features for managing the [[Apple Card]]:
*   **Interest Payment Slider** A clean, intuitive UI allows users to see how much interest they would pay with different payment schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. A red color in the UI actively discourages making only the minimum payment, which would accrue more interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Spending Category Gradient** The color gradient of the card within the app changes based on spending habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The card starts completely white before any spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Each time money is spent at a different merchant or category, colors are added to the gradient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Purchases instantly populate in the app, adding color to the card's gradient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Purchase History and Maps** The app provides a purchase history, allowing users to delve into each transaction and view its location on a map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

## [[security_features_of_apple_card | Security Features of Apple Card]]
The [[Apple Card]]'s integration with the iPhone enhances its security:
*   **Face ID Authentication** All card access within the app is secured with Face ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This means that even if the physical card is found or stolen, it cannot be used without access to the user's iPhone and Face ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Remote Deactivation** Users can remotely deactivate the card from within the Wallet app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Virtual Card Number** The physical [[Apple Card unboxing and design features | Apple Card]] itself does not have a card number for increased security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. The card number for online purchases is available securely within the Wallet app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

## [[apple_card_rewards_and_cashback_system | Apple Card Rewards and Cashback System]]
The [[Apple Card]] offers cashback that is delivered as [[apple_card_rewards_and_cashback_system | Apple Cash]] the next day, allowing users to spend it 24 hours after earning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   1% cash back on all purchases made with the physical card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   2% cash back on all purchases made using Apple Pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   3% cash back on purchases from the Apple Store or Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## [[impact_of_apple_card_on_user_commitment_to_the_apple_ecosystem | Impact on User Commitment to the Apple Ecosystem]]
The deep integration of the [[Apple Card]] with the iPhone and Wallet app can be seen as another tool designed to solidify user commitment to the Apple ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. The features are so intertwined that switching to a non-Apple device, like an Android phone, would mean giving up the benefits and convenience of the integrated credit card experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

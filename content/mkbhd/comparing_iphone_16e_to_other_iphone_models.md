The 2025 [[iphone_16e_features_and_specifications | iPhone 16e]] marks a significant shift in Apple's budget-friendly iPhone lineup. Unlike previous [[Comparison between iPhone XR and iPhone XS | iPhone SE]] models, which were definitively budget phones, the [[iphone_16e_features_and_specifications | iPhone 16e]] is no longer positioned as one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. This change in positioning makes it much harder to recommend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

## Pricing and Value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>
The [[iphone_16e_features_and_specifications | iPhone 16e]] starts at $599 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. With Apple's standard storage upgrade prices, a model being tested can cost up to $900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. While it is the cheapest new iPhone available, its price point means it is no longer truly "cheap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. This contrasts sharply with previous [[Comparison between iPhone XR and iPhone XS | iPhone SE]] generations, which were priced at $399 and $429 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>, making them easy recommendations for many users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

The speaker notes that the primary issue with the [[iphone_16e_features_and_specifications | iPhone 16e]] is its price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. Factors like tariffs, R&D for the new C1 chip, increased RAM for Apple Intelligence, and inflation may contribute to the higher cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

## Design and Features Inherited from Older Models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>
The [[iphone_16e_features_and_specifications | iPhone 16e]] continues Apple's "parts bin strategy," leveraging existing engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.
*   **Body:** It primarily uses the body of the [[Comparison of iPhone 14 Pro with previous models | iPhone 14]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, featuring an aluminum build, flat sides, USB Type-C, and IP68 water resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.
*   **Action Button:** The Action Button has been added to the left side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.
*   **Display:** The front also appears to be from the [[Comparison of iPhone 14 Pro with previous models | iPhone 14]], with a 6.1-inch screen, a notch, and Face ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. While an improvement over the previous [[Comparison between iPhone XR and iPhone XS | iPhone SE]]'s design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>, the display is not the brightest in direct sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a> and is still 60 hertz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

## Hardware Cuts and Comparisons

### Processor
The [[iphone_16e_features_and_specifications | iPhone 16e]] receives the A18 chip, the newest silicon from the flagship [[iPhone 16 and 16 Pro features and updates | iPhone 16]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>. However, this is a binned version with one less GPU core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. This is a common practice and is unlikely to be noticed by most users, except perhaps during intense gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. Despite this, it remains one of the most powerful phones in its price bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.

### Colors
The [[iphone_16e_features_and_specifications | iPhone 16e]] is available only in matte black or matte white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>, a departure from the bright colors of previous [[Comparison between iPhone XR and iPhone XS | iPhone SE]] models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. The Product Red program is no longer present in Apple's lineups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

### MagSafe
One significant omission is MagSafe support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. While the previous [[Comparison between iPhone XR and iPhone XS | iPhone SE]] also lacked MagSafe, its absence in a $600 iPhone is more disappointing now that MagSafe has become a staple of the iPhone experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. The phone instead relies on slow, first-gen Qi wireless charging (7.5 watts) without the magnetic alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.

### Camera
The [[iphone_16e_features_and_specifications | iPhone 16e]] features a new single camera on the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>. While it's 48 megapixels like the primary cameras on the [[iPhone 16 and 16 Pro features and updates | iPhone 16]] and [[iPhone 16 and 16 Pro features and updates | 16 Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>, it uses a much smaller sensor with inferior stabilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>. This results in:
*   Less shallow depth of field and natural bokeh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>.
*   Quicker image softening as light decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.
*   Increased likelihood of night mode activation and difficulty freezing action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.

Additionally, the single lens means the phone is missing Cinematic Mode, Spatial Video, and Macros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>. While fine for its price range, it clearly sits below the cameras of the [[iPhone 16 and 16 Pro features and updates | iPhone 16]] and [[iPhone 16 and 16 Pro features and updates | 16 Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>.

### Other Missing Features
The [[iphone_16e_features_and_specifications | iPhone 16e]] also lacks Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a> and ultrawide band for precision finding with AirTags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. The Action Button on this model also does not support camera control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.

## The New C1 Cellular Modem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>
A significant new component in the [[iphone_16e_features_and_specifications | iPhone 16e]] is Apple's first in-house-designed cellular modem, named C1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. This marks the first iPhone without a Qualcomm modem, with Apple's own design handling 4G, 5G, GPS, and satellite connectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>.

*   **Performance:** Performance-wise, users are unlikely to notice significant differences in speed tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>. There is no millimeter wave 5G support yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.
*   **Efficiency and Battery Life:** The primary claimed improvement of the C1 modem is efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>. Modems can be major power draws, especially in areas with poor signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>. Because the [[iphone_16e_features_and_specifications | iPhone 16e]] uses a modern-sized body and the C1 modem is physically smaller, it allows for a physically larger battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>. This leads to significantly improved battery life, reportedly on par with the [[iPhone 16 and 16 Pro features and updates | 16 Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>.

This debut in a lower-volume phone like the [[iphone_16e_features_and_specifications | 16e]] allows Apple to iron out kinks before a wider rollout, potentially in the [[iPhone 16 and 16 Pro features and updates | iPhone 17]] series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>. It may also contribute to enabling Apple to create a "super thin iPhone Air" with good battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>.

## Overall Recommendation

The [[iphone_16e_features_and_specifications | iPhone 16e]] appears to exist to push consumers up Apple's classic "price ladder" to the [[iPhone 16 and 16 Pro features and updates | iPhone 16]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>, which offers features like MagSafe and an ultrawide camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>.

### Comparison to Refurbished iPhone 15 Pro
It is strongly suggested that anyone considering the [[iphone_16e_features_and_specifications | iPhone 16e]] should first consider a refurbished iPhone 15 Pro, which can be found for around $600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>. The iPhone 15 Pro is argued to be superior in almost every aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>:
*   **Screen:** Way brighter, more visible, and higher refresh rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>.
*   **Camera:** Triple cameras instead of one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:00]</a>.
*   **Battery Life:** Similar battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:49:00">[13:49:00]</a>.
*   **Age:** Only one year older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>.
*   **Intelligence:** Includes Apple Intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>.

### Apple's Intended Audience
Apple's own comparison tool for the [[iphone_16e_features_and_specifications | 16e]] on their website primarily compares it to older models like the [[Comparison between iPhone 11 and iPhone 10R | iPhone 12]]/[[Comparison between iPhone 11 and iPhone 10R | 12 Mini]], [[Comparison of iPhone 11 Pro to previous models | iPhone 11]], and older [[Comparison between iPhone XR and iPhone XS | SEs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>. For users upgrading from these significantly older phones, the [[iphone_16e_features_and_specifications | 16e]] offers a more modern [[Design and usability changes in the iPhone 16e | design]], a new chip, and Apple Intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>. However, even for this audience, the new price point is a major drawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>.

> [!summary] Key Takeaway
> The [[iphone_16e_features_and_specifications | iPhone 16e]] is a modern iPhone that has shed its "budget" identity with a higher price tag. While it integrates some modern features and a new modem for efficiency, it comes with notable compromises in display, camera, and features like MagSafe compared to its contemporaries and even slightly older, more premium refurbished models. Its value proposition is significantly diminished compared to its predecessors.

The 10th Generation Baseline iPad introduces a significant design change by being the first iPad to move its webcam to the long side, or long bezel, of the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Overview of the Change
This new [[new_design_and_features_of_the_10th_generation_ipad | 10th generation iPad]] has a 12-megapixel ultrawide webcam with Center Stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, which is now situated on the landscape edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## Benefits
This webcam relocation is considered by some to be the best change in the hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. When users are on video calls or looking at the camera, their gaze will appear to be directed at the camera, rather than off to the side as with previous iPad models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This is a welcome improvement for user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

## Implications for Design and Features
The relocation of the webcam has specific implications for other iPad features:
*   **Apple Pencil Compatibility** The spot typically used for magnetically attaching and wirelessly charging the second-generation Apple Pencil is now occupied by the webcam housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This design choice means the 10th generation iPad does not support the second-generation Apple Pencil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **Other Side Occupancy** The other long side of the iPad contains the smart pins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, and the top and bottom edges feature speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. These placements contribute to the inability to accommodate the second-generation Apple Pencil.
*   **iPad Pro Comparison** Although the new M2 [[ipad_pro_as_a_laptop_replacement|iPad Pro]] also features a 12-megapixel ultrawide webcam with Center Stage, its webcam remains on the side spot and has not been moved to the long side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This suggests that Apple views the long-side webcam placement as a trade-off: users can have either the improved webcam position or support for the second-generation Apple Pencil, but not both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

MKBHD introduces the new [[iPhone 12 design and aesthetics | iPhone 12]] and [[iPhone 12 Pro features | iPhone 12 Pro]], noting the controversial new unboxing experience [00:00:07]. By the time the video was released, the phones had been used for a couple of days as part of the review process [00:00:22].

## Smaller Box Design

The most striking visual change is the new, smaller iPhone box, which is about half the volume and half the height of previous iPhone packaging [00:00:46]. Other iPhones will also begin shipping with this smaller box design [00:00:48].

### Unboxing the iPhone 12 (Product Red)

Upon opening the box, the phone is immediately visible right on top, placed face down [00:01:04]. The phone's footprint takes up almost the entire box, with minimal padding [00:01:07]. The unboxing involves a simple plastic peel [00:01:18].

The Product Red [[iPhone 12 design and aesthetics | iPhone 12]] appears visually, though the reviewer notes it doesn't look "that red" [00:01:23].

Inside the box, the only included items are:
*   A USB-C to Lightning cable [00:01:34]
*   Paperwork, including a half-sized pamphlet [00:01:38]
*   A Product Red sheet [00:01:42]
*   A SIM card removal tool [00:01:43]
*   A single white sticker [00:01:44]

Notably absent from the box are a wall charging brick and headphones [00:01:51].

### Unboxing the iPhone 12 Pro

The [[iPhone 12 Pro features | iPhone 12 Pro]] comes in a box of the exact same size as the [[iPhone 12 design and aesthetics | iPhone 12]] box, but it is entirely black with blue accents for the Pacific Blue model, aligning with the dark themes of the Pro phones [00:01:57]. The phone is also positioned right at the top upon opening [00:02:09]. The contents of the [[iPhone 12 Pro features | iPhone 12 Pro]] box are identical to the [[iPhone 12 design and aesthetics | iPhone 12]], without special colored stickers for the Pro model or a Product Red sheet [00:02:14].

## The Charging Brick Controversy

The most controversial aspect of the [[iPhone 12 unboxing experience | iPhone 12 unboxing]] is the exclusion of the charging brick [00:02:27]. Apple's stated defense is an environmental benefit, aiming to reduce landfill waste from shipped chargers and materials that people already own [00:02:34].

However, the reviewer points out a significant issue: the wall bricks Apple has traditionally shipped with iPhones are USB-A, while the [[iPhone 12 design and aesthetics | iPhone 12]] now comes with a USB-C cable [00:02:48]. This means most new [[iPhone 12 design and aesthetics | iPhone 12]] buyers, who likely only have USB-A wall bricks, will need to purchase a separate USB-C wall brick, which Apple conveniently sells [00:03:00].

## First Impressions: Design and Aesthetics

The updated industrial design of the [[iPhone 12 design and aesthetics | iPhone 12]] and [[iPhone 12 Pro features | iPhone 12 Pro]] is well-received, described as solid, a little heavy, and featuring desirable boxy sides that draw inspiration from the [[iPad Pro]] or the iPhone 4/5 eras [00:03:16]. Key design elements include:
*   Antenna lines near the corners [00:03:38]
*   Super tight tolerances [00:03:40]
*   A flat screen [00:03:41]
*   A minimal, though not zero, camera bump [00:03:43]

The square sides make the phones more grippable, though some might initially find them slightly sharp or less comfortable [00:03:51]. The design also allows the phone to stand on its own [00:04:06].

### Material and Weight Differences

A notable difference exists between the two models:
*   The [[iPhone 12 Pro features | iPhone 12 Pro]] has glossy stainless steel sides [00:04:11].
*   The [[iPhone 12 design and aesthetics | iPhone 12]] has more matte aluminum sides [00:04:16].

The reviewer prefers the aluminum sides due to fingerprints on stainless steel, similar to preferences for the aluminum Apple Watch [00:04:20]. The aluminum also makes the phone lighter [00:04:31]. Though the phones are the exact same size (cases fit both), the [[iPhone 12 Pro features | iPhone 12 Pro]] weighs 192 grams due to stainless steel and an extra camera, while the [[iPhone 12 design and aesthetics | iPhone 12]] weighs 162 grams [00:04:33].

A wish is expressed for a hybrid build combining the satin back of the Pro models with the aluminum sides of the [[iPhone 12 design and aesthetics | iPhone 12]] [00:04:49]. The Product Red color of the [[iPhone 12 design and aesthetics | iPhone 12]] is noted as the "least red Product Red" seen so far, appearing more like peach, red-orange, or coral [00:04:56].

The cutout on the right side of the phone, beneath the power button, is for the 5G antennas, as all new iPhones support 5G [00:05:19]. The phones still retain the familiar iPhone appearance, including the notch at the top [00:05:35]. The [[iPhone 12 design and aesthetics | iPhone 12]] now features a much better-looking OLED display, essentially matching the quality seen on the Pro models [00:05:41].

## MagSafe

A new feature with the [[iPhone 12 design and aesthetics | iPhone 12]] lineup is MagSafe, which incorporates magnets into the back of the phone's wireless charging coil for compatible accessories [00:06:02]. This system is intended to enable a new range of accessories that magnetically attach to the phone [00:06:14].

### Magnet Visualization

Using magnet paper, the MagSafe system is visualized:
*   An older iPhone (like the iPhone 11) shows no magnetic activity except near the speakers at the bottom [00:06:41].
*   The [[iPhone 12 design and aesthetics | iPhone 12]] reveals concentric circles with straight alignment lines when magnet paper is applied, indicating the embedded magnets [00:06:50].

### MagSafe Accessories

Accessories designed for MagSafe align with these magnetic patterns [00:06:58].

*   **MagSafe Charger:** This accessory is a thin, hockey puck-shaped charger attached to a three-foot USB-C cable [00:07:11]. It resembles a larger Apple Watch charger, with a flat metal exterior and white plastic interior [00:07:20]. It snaps precisely over the Apple logo on the back of the phone and can spin freely [00:07:28]. When connected, an NFC chip inside the charger triggers a specific circular MagSafe charging animation on the iPhone's screen, indicating 15W charging [00:07:44].

*   **MagSafe Wallet:** This wallet accessory has corresponding internal magnets to align with the iPhone [00:08:02]. It snaps onto the back of the phone "somewhat firmly" but is "not super strong" [00:08:09]. It also triggers an appropriate animation on the screen, showing the phone recognizes the attached accessory [00:08:17].

*   **MagSafe Case:** These cases incorporate the magnetic coils [00:08:24]. When a MagSafe case is put on the phone, the entire screen lights up with an animation (e.g., a Pacific Blue animation for a specific blue case), indicating the phone recognizes the case [00:08:33]. A key benefit is that the MagSafe charger can still attach to the back of the phone and charge through the case [00:08:52]. The MagSafe wallet can also attach and be recognized through the case [00:09:02].

### Limitations and Observations

While MagSafe allows for one layer of accessories (like a case) to work through it, attempting to charge through both the wallet and the case simultaneously results in magnetic attachment but no charging [00:09:11]. The wallet is magnetically shielded to protect cards inside [00:09:23].

The reviewer's overall impression of MagSafe is that it is "kind of cool but not quite as cool as I was hoping," mainly due to the strength of the magnets being "a little loose" [00:09:41]. Concerns are raised about the magnet strength for accessories like car mounts, which might not hold the phone securely over bumps, and for the wallet, which can "easily just pop right off" when putting the phone in a pocket [00:10:01].

A "fun fact" is that the MagSafe charger is still technically a Qi wireless charger [00:10:37]. This means it can magnetize to and wirelessly charge many other Android phones that support Qi wireless charging [00:10:41].

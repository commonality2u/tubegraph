Despite producing phones with unique and useful features, Sony's smartphone division has faced significant challenges in market share and public awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Sony has maintained roughly a zero percent market share in smartphones for several consecutive years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## [[reasons_for_low_sales_of_sony_smartphones | Reasons for Low Sales]]

One primary reason for low sales is that most people are simply unaware of Sony's smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This is despite Sony's success and popularity in other product categories, such as mirrorless cameras (like the Alpha line) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>, the PlayStation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>, and televisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. The company has struggled to leverage its strong brand presence in other electronics to gain smartphone market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

### Targeting Enthusiasts vs. Mass Market

Sony's strategy appears to heavily target "enthusiasts" with high-end, niche features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. However, enthusiasts constitute a very small percentage of the overall smartphone market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. For high-volume sales, companies need to appeal to "everybody," which Sony phones, despite their unique features, generally fail to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

Examples of this misaligned focus include:
*   **Camera Features** The [[camera_technology_in_sony_phones | cameras]] offer sophisticated manual controls and professional-grade apps like Photo Pro and Cinema Pro, featuring eye tracking, exposure compensation, and focus racking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Yet, the phone lacks a simple, highly desired feature like a dedicated night mode for quick low-light photos, as seen in Pixel phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Front-Facing Camera** The front-facing camera records at only 1080p 30fps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, despite a growing number of consumers prioritizing the front camera, sometimes even more than the rear ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **[[display_quality_of_sony_smartphones | Display Quality]]** While the Xperia One Mark II features a 4K 60Hz display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>, most consumers would not recognize this high resolution without being told, indicating that this premium feature does not necessarily drive mass adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   **Professional Users** Many users who would benefit most from the advanced manual camera controls already own and use dedicated mirrorless cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Therefore, these features act more as an "added feature" for current owners rather than a "selling feature" to attract new customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### Poor Launch Strategy and Execution

Sony's inability to properly launch phones to the masses is a significant issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Delayed Releases** The Xperia One Mark II, for example, was unveiled in May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>, but units did not reach reviewers until six months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This extended delay allows hype to die down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   **Lack of Priority** Such prolonged launch periods suggest a "poorly thought out" or "poorly executed" strategy, making it seem as though the smartphone division is not a priority for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   **Successor Announcement Issues** The delay can be so severe that a phone's successor is announced before the original model is widely available. The Xperia 5 Mark II, a smaller version of the Xperia One Mark II with a 120Hz display, was announced while the Mark II was still in its delayed rollout phase, with its own availability not until December <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. This makes customers hesitant to purchase an expensive phone knowing a newer model is already announced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **Reviewer Impact** Delayed launches also negatively impact reviewers, who prefer to review phones with the most updated information and relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

This contrasts sharply with successful launch strategies seen from companies like [[apples_marketing_strategy_and_media_attention | Apple]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>, OnePlus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>, and Samsung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, which typically feature events followed by rapid pre-order and street availability to maintain hype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

## [[impact_on_the_smartphone_market | Impact on the Smartphone Market]]

Sony's smartphone sales have seen a concerning downward trend, falling from nearly 40 million smartphones annually to just 6.5 million in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. For perspective, this 2018 figure is comparable to the number of iPhones Apple sells in a single strong week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. The trend continued negatively into 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

Despite these struggles, the presence of competition in any field is crucial for product improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. The potential demise of Sony's mobile division, which appears to be "on life support" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>, would be a loss for the broader smartphone market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

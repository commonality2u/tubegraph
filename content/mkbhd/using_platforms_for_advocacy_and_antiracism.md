Marques, a tech YouTuber, shares his reflections on current global events, including a global pandemic, leadership chaos, and protests against police brutality against Black people in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. He was inspired to share his own [[reflections_on_race_and_personal_experiences | experiences]] after reading a post by [[influences_and_inspirations_from_public_figures | Neil deGrasse Tyson]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Personal Journey and Unintended Consequences

Marques has been a tech YouTuber since he was 15, turning a passion into a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This career has brought with it various responsibilities, including hiring and management decisions, and ethical questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. He credits his supportive parents for encouraging him to try new things and pursue his interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

His interests, including golf (since age 10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, ultimate frisbee (professional and club level) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, and tech, initially felt like escapes where his race wasn't a factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a> and he could bury himself in his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## The Reality of Race and Identity

Despite finding solace in his activities, Marques acknowledges that reality often intrudes. Experiences such as potentially being pulled over for arbitrary reasons serve as stark reminders of racial disparities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. He has had encounters with the police, as have his friends, though he also knows frustrated police officers within his own family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

As he matured and advanced in his pursuits, Marques noted a significant lack of diversity in high-level golf, ultimate frisbee, and tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This lack of diversity brought a "spotlight" back to the color of his skin, creating an internal conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. He wanted to be recognized for his skill (e.g., "one of the better frisbee players," or "one of the best creators period") rather than being defined by his race (e.g., "the good black frisbee player" or "one of the best black creators") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

This led to self-doubt, wondering if accomplishments, like making a high-end team, were due to his skill or because he was Black or had a platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. He recognizes that acknowledging this "mental hurdle" is worth sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, as it's not something everyone has to consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

## Using a Platform for Change

As an adult with a significant platform, Marques feels compelled to speak up for issues plaguing his community, even if it draws criticism like "stick to tech" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. He believes that silence feels worse than speaking up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. He contrasts this with his previous approach to role models, where he admired people like [[influences_and_inspirations_from_public_figures | Tiger Woods]] for golf skills and [[influences_and_inspirations_from_public_figures | Kobe Bryant]] for competitive spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

Marques intends to use his platform for two main purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>:
1.  **Promoting Antiracism**: To convey that racism is unacceptable and requires active work against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. He asserts that being anti-racist should not be controversial, and those who find it so are encouraged to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
2.  **Being a Role Model**: To be a figure that young people, especially those who look like him, can look up to for making right choices and finding success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

## How to Support Diverse Creators

Marques clarifies that while he appreciates offers of help, the real support is needed by organizations on the front lines, to whom he links for donations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. He specifically asks for support within his own sphere: [[supporting_and_promoting_diverse_content_creators | supporting and promoting diverse content creators]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

He emphasizes that genuine support means engaging with content because you genuinely enjoy it, rather than just subscribing. Subscribing without engagement sends a negative signal to YouTube's algorithms, potentially hindering a channel's visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Instead, he encourages finding and enjoying content from a diverse group of creators based on the quality of their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. He provides links to his favorite diverse creators in tech and other fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

Ultimately, he acknowledges that there are no easy answers, and everyone has different [[reflections_on_race_and_personal_experiences | experiences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. While social media can make these issues feel immediate, he stresses that this struggle is ongoing and requires continuous effort to spread the message, use voices responsibly, and move the needle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

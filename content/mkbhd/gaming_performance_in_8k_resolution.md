The question of whether [[8k_gaming_capabilities | 8K gaming]] is currently possible and desirable is explored, especially with the release of new consoles like the [[playstation_5_performance_and_speed | PS5]] and Xbox Series X, which reignited discussions about the capabilities of [[comparison_between_gaming_pcs_and_new_consoles | PC vs. console gaming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. While new consoles show a significant generational leap, the PC gaming community maintains that real power still resides in high-end personal computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Maximizing detail and immersion in gaming requires not only high frame rates but also high resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Hardware Requirements for 8K Gaming

Achieving true [[8k_gaming_capabilities | 8K gaming capabilities]] demands specific [[hardware_requirements_for_8k_gaming | hardware requirements for 8K gaming]].

### The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090

The [[Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 | Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090]] is introduced as the highest-end graphics card in Nvidia's new 3000 Series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This colossal card is designed to be capable of [[8k_gaming_capabilities | 8K gaming]], a feat that no new console can match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The video confirms that this card is built for 8K gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Custom PC Build for 8K Gaming

A custom-built Main Gear F131 computer is utilized, specifically constructed around the [[Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Its specifications include:
*   **Processor:** Intel Core i9 10900K (10 cores, 3.7 GHz base clock, turboing up to 5.3 GHz) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>
*   **RAM:** 32GB of fast HyperX Fury RAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>
*   **Motherboard:** MSI MPG Z490 Gaming motherboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>
*   **Storage:** 1TB Samsung NVMe SSD (970 Pro) as the boot drive, and an additional 2TB SSD for mass storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>
*   **Chassis:** Custom-built aluminum chassis with RGB lighting and tinted glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>

### Display and Connectivity

An 88-inch 8K OLED TV is used as the display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The [[Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090]] features HDMI 2.1 ports, which enable a single cable to output 8K resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. A thicker, less flexible HDMI cable is required for this connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Display settings confirm the resolution output at 7680 x 4320 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## Gaming Experience

### Forza Horizon 4

In Forza Horizon 4, the game locks at 60 FPS in 8K resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The game's intricate details, such as leaves on the ground, trees, and sky details, appear significantly crisper than at 1440p or 1080p <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. During winter scenes, individual snowflakes are visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The high resolution enhances immersion, making every intentionally placed detail by the developer noticeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Water droplets on the screen and car reflections are highly detailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. While largely stable, the GPU struggled briefly, dropping to 50 FPS and using 96% of its capacity when a significant amount of visual information was displayed, indicating the demand of pushing over 30 megapixels per frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Pre-rendered cutscenes in the game appear to drop to lower resolutions (e.g., 1440p or 1080p) before switching back to 8K for active gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

### Control Ultimate Edition

In Control Ultimate Edition, the game runs at around 52 FPS in 8K when idle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
When the "render resolution" (which affects environmental details) is set to 5K, the GPU utilization increases, and frame rates drop significantly to 21 FPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. Setting the render resolution to 4K yields 36 FPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, while 2K is suggested for the best experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. This demonstrates that the card is not "invincible" and frame rates can be impacted by internal rendering settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Even with a lower render resolution for the world, the character and overall game quality remain high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. The game benefits from 8K in terms of detail, including high-quality textures, reflections, and character models, enhancing immersion, especially in horror games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

## Conclusion

Can you game in 8K? Yes, especially with a graphics card like the [[Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. It can handle most games at very high resolutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

However, the complete [[8k_gaming_capabilities | 8K gaming]] experience also requires an 8K display, and the market for [[hardware_requirements_for_8k_gaming | 8K gaming monitors]] is not yet mature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. While dedicated 8K TVs exist, they are expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. As of 2020, there isn't a widespread need to game in 8K <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

Nonetheless, with the right setup, [[8k_gaming_capabilities | gaming in 8K]] can be spectacular, offering high refresh rates and resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. A high-end PC with the right specifications is more than capable of providing this experience, distinguishing itself from [[comparison_between_gaming_pcs_and_new_consoles | new consoles]] and their current capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. While console gaming on a 4K TV offers a good experience, PCs with an [[Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 | RTX 3090]] can officially output 60 FPS at 8K, a feat consoles cannot achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

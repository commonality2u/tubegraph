The [[battery_enhancements_in_iphone_13_pro | iPhone 13]] lineup features notable improvements in battery life, which has been highlighted as one of the most underrated changes in the new models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

## Design Changes for Enhanced Battery

The increased [[battery_enhancements_in_iphone_13_pro | battery capacity]] in the [[battery_enhancements_in_iphone_13_pro | iPhone 13]] models contributes to their slightly increased thickness (a quarter of a millimeter) and a noticeable gain of approximately 20 grams in weight compared to the [[iphone_12_display_and_battery_performance | iPhone 12]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. This design choice, making the phone a little thicker and heavier for a bigger battery, has been well-received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

## Performance Observations

Users have reported being very impressed with the battery performance, particularly on the larger phones within the [[battery_enhancements_in_iphone_13_pro | iPhone 13]] series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. For instance, the [[battery_enhancements_in_iphone_13_pro | iPhone 13 Pro]] was observed to have nearly five hours of screen-on time with half of its battery life still remaining, which is considered exceptionally good, even for a non-Pro Max model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

The [[battery_enhancements_in_iphone_13_pro | iPhone 13 mini]] also offers improved battery life compared to its predecessor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>.

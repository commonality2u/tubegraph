The [[battery_life_and_charging | battery life]] is considered the main weakness of the Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus, although it is not deemed "terrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Compared to other strong aspects of the phones, the [[battery_life_and_charging | battery life]] is "definitely not great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Battery Capacity
The larger Galaxy S9 Plus features a 3,500 mAh battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. The standard S9 has a 3,000 mAh battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Both capacities are described as "somewhat mediocre" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

Under heavy usage, including navigation, music playback, extensive screen-on time, videos, and social media, the S9 Plus's battery could be depleted by the end of a single day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Mobile gaming would also quickly drain the battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

## Charging Capabilities
The Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus retain the charging features present in the S8, including USB-C, fast charging, and wireless charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

The devices charge very quickly with the appropriate charger, such as the one included in the box or other USB-C chargers like a MacBook Pro charger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. However, the phone can be particular about chargers; for instance, a Dash Charger did not work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The ability to quickly top up the battery during the day helps to mitigate the phone's slightly weak [[battery_life_and_charging | battery life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. While better [[battery_life_and_charging | battery life]] would be ideal, the fast charging capabilities are considered sufficient for some users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

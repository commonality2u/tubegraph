The Walt Disney Company's [[disney_imagineering_labs_visit | Disney Imagineering Labs]] are a hub for designing and engineering the attractions, theme parks, and rides that characterize Disney experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. These labs incorporate a significant amount of experimental and unreleased technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## [[animatronic_robots_and_droids_at_disney | Animatronic Robots and Droids]]

The [[disney_imagineering_labs_visit | Disney Imagineering Labs]], located in various buildings across a California neighborhood, are where realistic [[animatronic_robots_and_droids_at_disney | animatronic robots]] and [[animatronic_robots_and_droids_at_disney | droids]] are created for attractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. These [[animatronic_robots_and_droids_at_disney | droids]] are similar to the Boston Dynamics Spot robot, capable of navigating any terrain with an adaptive gait and following instructions from a custom, easy-to-learn controller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. For theme parks, these [[animatronic_robots_and_droids_at_disney | droids]] adapt to any terrain and follow instructions from a customized Steam Deck controller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. They are designed to navigate relentlessly all day, interacting with guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The technology inside these [[animatronic_robots_and_droids_at_disney | droids]] blends animations for walking, standing, and looking around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## The HoloTile

One of the most innovative technologies at the labs is the HoloTile, an experimental, one-of-a-kind 360-degree treadmill that functions as a moving floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### How it Works

The HoloTile consists of numerous tiny, one-inch discs that spin on top of their bases, acting like miniature treadmills and turning to match the user's walking direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Unlike a traditional one-directional treadmill, the HoloTile uses articulating cones with tilted discs that have internal motors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Only the edge of the tilted disc touches the floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. When walking forward, the discs spin clockwise to move the foot back to the middle; when walking backward, they spin counterclockwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This mechanism ensures the user is always pulled back to the center regardless of direction, length, or speed of stride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Control and Experience

The HoloTile can be controlled in three ways:
*   **Hand Gestures**: Moving a hand across a certain line in front of sensors can control objects placed on the HoloTile, simulating "using the force" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **PlayStation 5 Controller**: While seated on the HoloTile, a PlayStation controller's left joystick controls position and the right controls rotation, allowing free movement and spinning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Walking**: Users can walk on the HoloTile, starting with a "training mode" at a fraction of normal speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. The responsiveness of the tiles gradually increases over about two minutes until it reaches 100% real-time speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

During use, several observations were made:
*   The device is noticeably loud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   Walking on it is not perfectly straight; users might glide over ridges, suggesting a future version could have smaller, more numerous discs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

### The Inventor

The HoloTile was invented by Lanny Smoot, who has been at Disney for over 20 years and holds more than 70 patents, including the real-life BB8 rolling mechanism and lightsabers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. He demonstrated the HoloTile's capability for two people to play a multiplayer racing game, controlling a BB8 by jogging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

### [[virtual_reality_applications_at_disney | VR Integration]]

The most groundbreaking application of the HoloTile is its use with a [[virtual_reality_applications_at_disney | virtual reality]] headset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. While other 360-degree treadmills exist for [[virtual_reality_applications_at_disney | VR]], a common challenge is the disagreement between what the eyes see (moving in a virtual world) and what the body and brain feel (walking in place), which can cause motion sickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

When used with an [[significant_technological_adva | Apple Vision Pro]] headset, users can walk around a 3D constructed environment. The visual input of moving forward conflicts with the brain's sensation of remaining stationary, making it challenging to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. However, Smoot demonstrated confident walking through a virtual space, showcasing the potential for free-form exploration of large virtual environments from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. This technology holds promise for the future of [[virtual_reality_applications_at_disney | virtual reality]] experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

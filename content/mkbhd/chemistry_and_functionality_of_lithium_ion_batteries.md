Modern smartphones primarily use [[Battery life and charging | lithium ion]] or Lithium Polymer batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. While battery chemistry has improved over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, the fundamental principles of operation remain similar.

## How Lithium Ion Batteries Work

A lithium ion battery consists of a positive side and a negative side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Discharging (Powering the Phone):** Lithium ions flow from the negative side to the positive side through a liquid electrolyte solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This flow releases energy into the phone's circuit, keeping it powered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Once this flow is complete, the battery is at 0% and is considered "dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Charging:** To charge the battery, these ions are moved back from the positive side to the negative side, again through the electrolyte solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Charging Dynamics

Batteries behave similarly to a sponge during charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>:
*   They absorb the most energy when they have the least charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   As they approach full capacity, their absorption efficiency decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   Excess energy that isn't absorbed efficiently is converted into heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

This results in a charging curve, where the peak wattage advertised for "fast charging" is not a constant rate, but typically reached only briefly at the beginning of the charge cycle when the battery is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. For instance, a 65-watt fast charger might only hit 65 watts for the first few minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. After around 80% charge, the phone will generally "trickle charge" at a much lower wattage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Battery Degradation and Health

[[Standard and advancements in maintaining battery lifespan | Batteries degrade over time]] naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This is because the repeated passage of ions through the electrolyte solution slowly breaks it down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This natural degradation is unavoidable as the phone is charged more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

Several factors contribute to battery degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>:
*   **State of Charge:** Batteries are "picky" and don't prefer being at exactly 100% or 0% charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Heat:** The number one factor that damages batteries and degrades them faster than normal is heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
    *   The electrolytes, which can be thought of as salts, are sensitive to changes in heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
    *   Excessive heat can cause the electrolytes to crystallize and clog the anodes and cathodes, preventing them from storing lithium ions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
    *   When a battery is not in an optimal state of charge, it operates less efficiently, and the excess runoff energy generates heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. The general goal is to minimize any excess heat around the battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

An industry standard for battery health is maintaining 80% [[Battery life and charging capabilities | battery health]] after 800 charge cycles, which typically equates to about two years of daily charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. For example, Apple states their batteries are rated for 80% after 500 charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, while Xiaomi's 120W charging technology is rated to maintain 80% after 800 cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Oppo and OnePlus claim their 150W charging phones will achieve 80% [[Battery life and charging | battery health]] after 1,600 cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

## Modern Advancements to Mitigate Heat

Smartphone companies have developed several methods to enable faster charging while minimizing heat generation near the battery:
*   **External Power Management:** One method, seen with OnePlus's Warp Charge 30T, is to handle power management in the charging brick itself, rather than in the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This shifts heat production away from the phone and its battery, allowing the phone to accept more power for longer periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. A drawback is larger power bricks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   **Parallel Charging:** Many companies, especially recently, have adopted parallel charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Instead of a single large battery, the phone's battery is split into two cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Power management hardware then splits the incoming power between these two cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. For instance, pumping 25 watts into two half-sized batteries generates significantly less heat than 50 watts into a single large battery, while achieving the equivalent of 50-watt charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. A downside is a slightly smaller overall [[Battery life and charging | battery capacity]] due to space taken by the boundary between cells and management hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Improved Cooling Hardware:** Newer phones increasingly incorporate more cooling hardware, such as heat shields, vapor chambers, or even fans (especially in gaming phones), to keep internal components from getting too hot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Better cooling systems allow more power to be put into the phone without excessive heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **Gallium Nitride (GaN) Chargers:** [[Battery life and charging capabilities | Gallium nitride chargers]] allow for much smaller power bricks while delivering the same power as traditional silicon chargers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **Smart Battery Management:** Modern phones feature advanced hardware sensors to measure temperature and regulate charging automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Software features also help users actively maintain battery health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
    *   **Pass-through Charging:** Phones like the ROG Phone 5 offer pass-through charging, where power directly fuels the system during activities like gaming instead of charging the battery, reducing stress and heat on the battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
    *   **Optimized Charging Schedules:** iPhones and Pixels can learn user charging habits, charging up to 80% initially and then waiting until just before the user typically wakes up to complete the charge to 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. This helps maintain [[Battery life and charging | battery health]].

To best preserve [[Battery life and charging | battery health]], users should avoid situations that cause the phone to get excessively hot, such as leaving it in a hot car or prolonged gaming while plugged in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. The infamous Samsung Galaxy Note 7 battery issue, for example, was not due to fast charging or overheating, but rather manufacturing errors related to battery dimensions and bending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

The Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha is a functional prototype smartphone showcasing a unique design concept where the display curves over the back of the device, creating an "110% screen" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It is not a commercially available phone with a price or shipping date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Design and Display Innovation
The Mi Mix Alpha pushes design boundaries, continuing the tradition of Xiaomi's Mix line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Its display, materials, and specifications are described as "next level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### [[design_and_materials_of_xiaomi_mi_mix_alpha | Design and Materials]]
The phone's frame is made from a titanium alloy, which is harder than stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The camera covers are crafted from sapphire, and the camera strip on the back is ceramic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The device is notably heavy and dense due to the extra material, including the screen glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### [[technical_specifications_of_xiaomi_mi_mix_alpha | Technical Specifications]]

*   **Connectivity:** 5G enabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>

### Display Features
The central focus of the phone is its wraparound OLED display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. It has a resolution of 2088 by 2250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. The top and bottom bezels are very thin and wrap around to meet the camera strip on the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The device also includes an in-display fingerprint reader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

[[innovative_features_and_functionality_of_xiaomi_mi_mix_alpha | Innovative features and functionality]] tied to the display include:
*   **Charging Animation:** When plugged in with the screen off, the entire display lights up, showing the battery filling up like liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This animation doesn't stay on during the entire charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Notifications:** Notifications cause the screen to glow all the way around the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **MIUI Alpha Software Optimizations:** Battery, status bar icons, and notification counters are placed on the side of the phone instead of at the top, allowing for a cleaner notification pull-down area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Camera Integration:** The camera strip houses a 108-megapixel primary camera, a 20-megapixel ultrawide camera with macro capabilities, a 12-megapixel telephoto camera, and dual LED flash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## User Experience and Practical Considerations
Holding the Mi Mix Alpha feels like holding "all screen," creating a strong immersion factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. It is heavy, but surprisingly not as slippery as some other glass phones, as fingers tend to grip the display glass better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### Audio and Selfie Camera
The traditional earpiece for phone calls is replaced by an electromagnetic speaker that vibrates through the glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, a technology seen in previous Mix phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. There is no dedicated selfie camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>; instead, users flip the phone around to take selfies using the main 108-megapixel camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. However, the selfie mode has limited functionality compared to the main camera modes, not allowing for ultrawide shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### [[challenges_and_practical_considerations_of_xiaomi_mi_mix_alpha | Challenges and Practical Considerations]]

#### Virtual Side Buttons
The virtual power and volume buttons located on the right side of the screen are described as "pretty bad" in this prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. While the concept aims to reject palm touches while recognizing button presses, the volume slider only works intermittently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. The power button, which only puts the phone to sleep, works more often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. A physical circular power button is still present at the top of the phone for sleep/wake, which always works but is a longer reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

#### Palm Rejection
Palm rejection on the wraparound screen is "hit or miss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Xiaomi uses accelerometers, gyroscopes, pressure sensors, and software algorithms to distinguish between holding and using the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. While it impresses when it works, accidental presses are frequent when it fails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

#### Back Display Utility
The back display serves several purposes:
*   **Charging Animation:** A visually appealing animation of power flowing into the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   **Status Indicators:** Moves battery, status, and notification icons to the side to keep the front display cleaner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Camera Viewfinder:** Allows using the main camera for high-quality selfies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Contextual Panel:** Detects when the phone is flipped over and activates a panel with quick-access widgets like a timer or weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **Aesthetics:** Primarily, it contributes to the phone's futuristic and "cool" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

#### Case Design
A case for the Mi Mix Alpha exists, attaching to the camera strip and offering minimal protection to the outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Given the delicate nature of the phone, it is questioned whether a case would be practical or desirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

#### Display Imperfections
The display isn't flawless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>:
*   **Glass Gaps:** At the apex of the curved sides, there's a noticeable gap in the cover glass, indicating three separate pieces of glass rather than one continuous curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This feels rough to the touch and can catch light, creating a "rainbow" effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **Yellowing:** Slight yellowing is present at the very edges of the display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   **Stability:** The phone wobbles significantly when placed on a flat surface due to the camera stripe design, making it difficult to lie flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

## Screen-to-Body Ratio and Size
Xiaomi claims a 180.6% screen-to-body ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. However, this figure is debated due to the presence of 2.15mm bezels at the top and bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. The official spec sheet lists a 7.9-inch diagonal screen, measured from corner to corner around the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. In reality, the phone's effective size is closer to a Pixel 4 or an [[design_and_display_of_iphone_11_pro | iPhone 11 Pro Max]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## Conclusion
The Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha is regarded as an impressive functional prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. It represents a "form over function" concept smartphone, akin to concept cars, that explores wild ideas which may one day evolve into practical features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

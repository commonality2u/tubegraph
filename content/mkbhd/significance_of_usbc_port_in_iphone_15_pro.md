The [[new_features_of_the_iphone_15_lineup | iPhone 15 Pro]] marks a significant shift with the [[introduction_of_usbc_in_iphones | introduction of USBC]] at its base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This change is particularly beneficial for users who manage multiple gadgets, as it allows a single charger to work across computers, headphones, mice, and keyboards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. While existing Lightning cables will no longer be compatible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, the transition offers convenience once users adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Driving Force Behind the Change

Apple's adoption of [[usbc_integration_in_iphones | USBC integration in iPhones]] was largely influenced by the European Union (EU), which mandated the standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Despite the change, Apple's primary marketing emphasis for the USBC port is its "one cable for everything" versatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Features and Limitations

The USBC port on the [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | iPhone 15 Pro]] brings several capabilities, though some expected advancements are absent:

*   **Charging Speed** The charging speed remains at 25 watts, showing no improvement over previous models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Desktop Mode** Unlike some other devices, there is no "desktop mode" functionality that allows the iPhone to connect to a monitor for a desktop-like experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Reverse Charging** The iPhone 15 Pro can reverse charge other phones at 4.5 watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Peripheral Connectivity** It supports connecting various peripherals like keyboards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a> and can mirror the screen to a monitor at up to 4K 60 frames per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Data Transfer Speed** The [[iphone_15_pro_advanced_features | iPhone 15 Pro]] supports USB 3.0 data transfer speeds, allowing for noticeably faster transfer of ProRes footage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. For the first time, users can also shoot video directly onto an external drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

## Included Cable & The A17 Pro Chip

The braided USB-C cable included in the box only supports USB 2.0 transfer speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Users requiring faster data transfer, especially for the Pro models, will need to purchase a separate, more robust USB 3.0 data cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. This distinction between charging and data cables is common in the USB-C ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

The [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | A17 Pro chip]] is crucial for enabling the higher USB 3.0 data transfer speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## Overall Verdict

Despite some limitations, the USBC port is arguably the most significant change in the [[iphone_15_and_15_pro_major_changes | iPhone 15 and 15 Pro major changes]] for many users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. Its introduction means iPhone users can now enjoy the universal connectivity that has been a hallmark of USB-C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

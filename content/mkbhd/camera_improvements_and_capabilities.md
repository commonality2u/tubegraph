The iPhone 15 Pro introduces significant updates primarily focused on its camera system, offering both hardware and software enhancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

## Main Camera System
The iPhone 15 Pro features a new, larger 48-megapixel main camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. By default, this camera outputs 24-megapixel images, a change from the previous 12-megapixel output, with only about one and a half times the file size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. This improved process, which is consistent across all iPhone 15 and 15 Pro models, combines a full 48-megapixel sensor shot for detail and a 12-megapixel quad-binned shot for light information and noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. The neural net then combines these to produce a hybrid 24-megapixel image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

Overall, photos taken with the iPhone 15 Pro camera are described as "pretty great," excelling in dynamic range and sharpness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. The iPhone remains one of the best cameras for simply pointing and shooting in full auto mode, consistently delivering good-looking results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. The improved Macro Mode is also highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>, and the camera offers a natural fall-off with the primary lens that can create blurred backgrounds without needing Portrait Mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. Autofocus is very fast, especially when faces are detected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. The larger sensor also benefits low-light photography, allowing for even longer handheld captures at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

The benefit of 24-megapixel images over 12-megapixel is primarily noticeable when zooming all the way in, revealing subtle differences in fine detail and contrast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. Beyond 2X zoom, the camera reverts to 12-megapixel images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. [[camera_improvements_in_iphone_15_series | Apple]] has also introduced presets for the 1X lens (24mm, 28mm, 35mm), each with dedicated image processing pipelines to maximize detail in these digitally zoomed focal lengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

## Video Capabilities
The [[iphone_camera_capabilities_and_features | iPhone's video capabilities]] are considered to be "far out in front of the rest of the smartphone world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. Even without 8K recording (which the 48-megapixel sensor is capable of) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>, 4K at 30 frames per second in full auto mode demonstrates world-class detail, autofocus, depth, dynamic range, and stabilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. The new AV1 Codec support on the A17 Pro chip also plays well with YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

A significant "Pro camera feature" added this year is the ability to shoot Log video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. When shooting in Log, the iPhone captures video with significantly more information, featuring the classic flat Log look and extended dynamic range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. This allows users to avoid Apple's default over-sharpening and saturation, and either apply Apple's transformation LUTs or fully grade the footage themselves for maximum quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.

A persistent issue, particularly with video, is the haloing from point light sources, which appears to be quite dramatic and possibly worse on the iPhone compared to other phones, despite new lens coatings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

## Telephoto Lens
The iPhone 15 Pro Max is the only model to include a new 5X telephoto lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>, which increases the maximum zoom from 15X to 25X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. This feature is beneficial for users who frequently take zoomed photos and videos, such as concert-goers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. However, this 5X lens means that 4X photos might actually be worse on the Pro Max <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. While Samsung offers a 10X optical lens that outperforms Apple's in terms of reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>, Apple's main advantage lies in its stabilization, featuring a zoom-in preview window and over-stabilizing the frame for clearer zoomed shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.

## Software Influence
Many of the differences between [[camera_features_and_performance | smartphone cameras]], including iPhones, Samsungs, and Pixels, are largely due to software and are not consistently discernible across all scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. Ultimately, the preference for image quality and user interface comes down to individual taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.

## RAW Max Feature
The camera interface includes a "RAW Max" button for taking full-resolution 48-megapixel Pro RAW photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. To shoot a 48-megapixel JPEG, users must navigate to the Settings app, switch the format, and then the button will display "JPEG Max" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.

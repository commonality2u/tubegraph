The Nothing Phone is the first smartphone from the startup Nothing, which previously released the Nothing Ear (1) earbuds in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. In a market where most popular phones are designed to appeal to the masses and end up looking similar with a big screen, cameras, and pale colors, Nothing aimed to create a unique-looking phone with cool features surrounding its distinct appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The phone is set to be released around July 12th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

The Nothing Phone continues the [[nothing_phone_design_and_transparency_theme | transparency theme]] seen in the Ear (1) earbuds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. While not fully transparent, it features clear plastic elements that reveal strategically placed and painted shielding inside, creating a distinct aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Despite some comparisons to an iPhone 12 with a transparent back due to its dual cameras and general shape, the Nothing Phone's appearance is notably different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The design is described as looking like a "movie prop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Glyph Interface

The most striking unique feature of the Nothing Phone is its "Glyph Interface" on the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This system features just over 900 LEDs arranged in a pattern across the entire back of the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. These LEDs are positioned around the dual cameras, the central wireless charging pad, and in stripes extending into the corner and down by the charging port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. They are frosted over to ensure the glow appears as a clean, solid, continuous light bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

The Glyph Interface serves as an advanced notification LED system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a> and offers several functionalities:

*   **Notifications**: It lights up and pulses for incoming notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Charging Indicator**: The lights glow when the phone is wirelessly charging or reverse wireless charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. When plugged into USB-C, the bottom light bar illuminates and acts as a progress bar indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. If the lights turn off, simply wiggling the phone will reactivate them to show charging progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **Fill Light for Cameras**: The entire Glyph Interface can light up simultaneously to serve as a fill light for the cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. These LEDs are bright enough to make a difference for close-up subjects or in darker rooms, unlike typical phone flashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Recording Indicator**: A blinking red light on the back indicates when video recording is active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Customizable Light Patterns

Nothing has integrated a user interface within the phone's settings to allow users to control how the lights operate, including when they turn on and what they light up for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

One of the most impressive features is the integration of 10 built-in ringtones, each accompanied by a unique light pattern that perfectly matches the ringtone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Users can pair specific ringtones with certain contacts, enabling identification of who is calling even when the phone is muted, simply by observing the light pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. At launch, the phone will also support different light patterns for notifications from various applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. It is anticipated that Nothing may add more such features through future software updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Market Strategy

Nothing's strategy is to stand out with its cool features and unique design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. This approach aims to acquire a small number of loyal customers initially, with the possibility of developing more broadly appealing phones in the future if the first run is successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

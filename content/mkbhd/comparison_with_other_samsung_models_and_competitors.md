The [[samsung_galaxy_s10_models_overview | Samsung Galaxy S9]] is described as a "nearly perfect Samsung phone," representing the best and most complete version of Samsung's offerings to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. It caters strongly to those who have previously enjoyed Samsung's software, cameras, design, and build quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Conversely, if users dislike aspects like slow Android updates or Samsung's custom skin, the S9 is unlikely to change their minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

The Galaxy S9 maintains many of the core features and design principles of its predecessors while introducing key enhancements.

## Comparison with Previous Samsung Galaxy S Models

### Design and Display
*   **Infinity Display:** Like the [[samsung_galaxy_s10_models_overview | Galaxy S8]], the S9 features the Infinity Display, which remains one of the absolute best displays in any [[comparison_to_other_phones_in_the_market | smartphone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Bezels and Sensors:** The S9 has slightly thinner top and bottom bezels than the S8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Samsung has also improved the concealment of sensors in the top bezel, making the black areas appear more seamless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Audio:** The earpiece on the S9 now functions as a second front-facing speaker, creating a stereo sound experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. While not equivalent to two large, dedicated front-facing speakers, it offers louder and clearer audio, preventing complete sound loss if the bottom speaker is accidentally blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Core Features:** The S9 retains essential features from the S8, including USB-C, wireless charging, fast charging, a headphone jack, water resistance, and "A-plus" build quality with clicky buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Fingerprint Reader:** The most significant external change is the repositioning of the fingerprint reader to the middle of the device, rather than at the top next to the camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This new placement is considered perfect, being slightly raised for easy tactile identification without looking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Fingerprint registration is also streamlined, requiring just one slow swipe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Health Sensors
*   The S9 introduces a blood pressure sensor, in addition to the heart rate monitor present in previous models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Performance and Software
*   **Specs:** The S9 maintains and upgrades the top-notch specifications seen in the S8, featuring a Snapdragon 845 processor and either 4 or 6 gigabytes of RAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Smoothness:** It feels like the smoothest Samsung phone yet, nearly matching the Pixel 2 in smoothness in most applications, despite occasional hiccups in Samsung's own apps like Bixby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Biometrics:** The S9 incorporates iris scanning, a feature previously seen on the Note series, which is slower but more secure than standard facial recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. It also introduces "Intelligent Scan," which combines face and iris scanning to choose the most effective method based on lighting conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Software Ecosystem:** Samsung's signature colorful Android skin and abundance of advanced features remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. It still includes duplicated apps (e.g., two browsers, two smart assistants, two calendars, two messaging apps) reflecting Samsung's ecosystem push, though these can be disabled by the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

## Comparison with Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus

The [[samsung_galaxy_s10_models_overview | Galaxy S9 Plus]] offers several advantages over the standard S9:
*   **RAM:** The S9 Plus has 6GB of RAM, while the regular S9 has 4GB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Both are generally sufficient, with the difference rarely noticeable in daily use, but the S9 Plus offers better future-proofing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Camera:** The S9 Plus includes a second telephoto camera, enabling features like Live Focus and optical zoom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   **Screen Size:** The S9 Plus has a 6.2-inch display compared to the S9's 5.8-inch display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Battery:** The S9 Plus has a larger 3,500 mAh battery, while the S9 has a 3,000 mAh battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Both are considered "somewhat mediocre" in terms of battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

## Comparison with Samsung Galaxy Note 8

The existence of the [[samsung_galaxy_s10_models_overview | Galaxy S9 Plus]] at its price point significantly reduces the reasons to purchase a [[samsung_galaxy_s10_models_overview | Galaxy Note 8]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. The Note 8's primary differentiator is its stylus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. If the stylus is not a crucial feature for a user, the S9 Plus is a preferred choice due to its lower price point, even with a slightly smaller screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. The S9 Plus also offers similar or better media experiences, including its large screen and stereo speakers, mitigating many traditional reasons for choosing a Note device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

## Comparison with Competitor Phones

### Google Pixel 2
*   **Smoothness:** The S9's performance nearly matches the Pixel 2 in overall smoothness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. However, it still doesn't quite match stock Android due to small performance hiccups in Samsung's own apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Camera:** Despite significant improvements to the S9's camera, the Pixel 2 still holds the title for the best camera in any [[comparison_to_other_phones_in_the_market | smartphone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

### Apple iPhone X
*   **Camera:** The S9's camera is considered to fall slightly behind the [[comparison_of_iphone_11_pro_to_previous_models | iPhone 10]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **General Performance:** The reviewer indicates a personal preference for the Pixel 2 as a daily driver over the Galaxy S9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

### General [[comparison_to_other_phones_in_the_market | Smartphone]] Features
*   **Display:** The Galaxy S9's display is considered the master of its class, with no other phone offering a better display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
*   **Camera (Variable Aperture):** The S9 is the first modern [[comparison_to_other_phones_in_the_market | smartphone]] to feature a variable aperture camera (f/1.5 and f/2.4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This significantly improves low-light photos by allowing more light into the sensor, resulting in less grain and smoothing compared to other devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

## Other Comparisons

*   **Fast Charging Compatibility:** The S9 charges quickly with its included charger and other USB-C chargers like a MacBook Pro charger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. However, it can be particular, as some chargers like the Dash Charger are not compatible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

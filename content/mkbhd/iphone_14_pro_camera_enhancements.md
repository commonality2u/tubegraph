The iPhone 14 Pro's camera system represents the most significant change to the iPhone camera in many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. Apple dedicated approximately 33% of its September event keynote to discussing the camera capabilities of the [[iphone_14_pro_features_and_innovations | iPhone 14 Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

## Primary Camera: A Leap to 48 Megapixels

For the first time since the iPhone 6s, which confidently repeated 12-megapixel sensors, the iPhone 14 Pro makes a significant leap in megapixel count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.
The primary camera now features a new 48-megapixel sensor, which is 65% larger than the one found in the [[iphone_12_camera_improvements | iPhone 12 Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. This sensor incorporates second-generation Focus Shift Optical Image Stabilization, 100% Focus Pixels, and is paired with a new f/1.78 lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

### Benefits of the 48MP Sensor
The larger 48-megapixel sensor provides several advantages:
*   **Pixel Binning:** It typically bins down to 12 megapixels for standard photos, still delivering benefits in sharpness and light gathering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.
*   **Faster Shutter Speeds:** Enables faster shutter speeds to freeze motion, especially in less-than-perfect conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.
*   **Improved Low Light:** Allows for low-light photos with shorter shutter times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.
*   **Natural Depth of Field:** Delivers a noticeably shallow natural depth of field without requiring Portrait Mode, more so than previous iPhone cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. Despite the challenges this presents for fringing and autofocus, the iPhone handles these well, with minimal fringing and locked-in subject tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

### 2x Optical Zoom
The 48-megapixel sensor also enables a new 2x zoom button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. This functions like an optical zoom by cropping into the middle 12 megapixels of the large sensor, meaning there is no loss in quality, unlike digital zooms on previous iPhones that cropped into an already 12-megapixel image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

### Action Mode
For video, the 48-megapixel sensor allows for a new "Action Mode," which provides aggressive stabilization for shaky video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This mode uses a heavy crop but can still shoot up to 2.8K resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. It's recommended to switch back to the primary camera from the default 0.5x ultra-wide for better results, as the ultra-wide can be noisier in this mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

### ProRaw
Users can shoot in ProRaw to access the full 48-megapixel files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. These files are large, typically 50-70 megabytes (DNG files), and offer significant detail and latitude for post-processing in applications like Lightroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.

## Selfie Camera Improvements
The new selfie camera is now 12 megapixels and includes autofocus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. It handles a variety of focal lengths much better and is generally sharper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

## Video Capabilities
*   **ProRes Video:** The iPhone 14 Pro continues to support ProRes video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.
*   **Cinematic Mode:** Cinematic Mode now supports 30 frames per second (FPS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. However, the natural depth of field on the primary camera is so good that Cinematic Mode might be used less often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.

## Overall Camera System Assessment
The [[iphone_14_pro_camera_upgrades | iPhone 14 Pro]] is considered the best camera system in any phone in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

### Strengths
*   **Versatility:** The overall versatility of the camera system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
*   **Shutter Speed Improvements:** Enhanced ability to capture motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.
*   **Image Quality:** High-quality photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.
*   **Autofocus:** Great autofocus performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.
*   **Color Consistency:** Consistent color across the three different cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.
*   **Improved Ultra Wide:** Image processing pipeline improvements have made the ultra-wide camera more usable and less noisy in low light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.

### Limitations
*   **HDR Over-baking:** The camera can sometimes over-bake HDR in harsh shooting conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.
*   **Selfie Camera Overexposure:** The selfie camera still tends to overexpose individuals with dark skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.
*   **Minimum Focus Distance:** The primary camera has a weak minimum focus distance, requiring a switch to macro mode for close-up subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.
*   **No 8K Video:** Despite the 48-megapixel sensor exceeding the 30-megapixel threshold required for 8K video, the iPhone 14 Pro does not offer 8K video recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. This is likely due to the large file sizes of ProRes video (5-6 GB per minute) and the slow data transfer speeds of the Lightning port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.
*   **No Astrophotography Mode:** The iPhone still struggles with super low-light and astrophotography, a feature some had hoped for given the "far out" event theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

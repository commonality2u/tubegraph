The [[iPhone XR display features | iPhone XR]], also referred to as the iPhone 10r in the transcript, was introduced as a more affordable iPhone model with distinct design and build characteristics compared to its counterparts, the iPhone 10s and 10s Max <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Size
The [[iPhone XR display features | iPhone XR]] features a 6.1-inch display, positioning its size between the iPhone 10s and the 10s Max <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This display size can make it harder for most users to reach the corners and top of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Materials and Build
The [[iPhone XR display features | iPhone XR]] is constructed from different materials compared to the iPhone 10s, despite sharing a similar overall aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
Key material differences include:
*   **No Stainless Steel** The [[iPhone XR display features | iPhone XR]] does not feature stainless steel in its frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **Anodized Aluminum Sides** It utilizes anodized aluminum for its sides, which allows for color matching with the glass backs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Slipperiness** The aluminum frame is noted to be even more slippery than the stainless steel found on other models, making it prone to sliding out of pockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **Glass Backs** The glass backs are described as super saturated, bright, and vibrant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. However, the aluminum on the rails is consistently less saturated than the glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Colors
The [[iPhone XR display features | iPhone XR]] is available in six new colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. The red is highlighted as a favorite, with blue taking a close second place due to its appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The coral and yellow options are less favored, primarily because their rail colors are less saturated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The black and white options are noted as standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Overall, the inclusion of colors is seen as a positive aspect of the design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Water Resistance
The [[iPhone XR display features | iPhone XR]] has an IP67 water resistance rating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, which is slightly less than the iPhone 10s's IP68 rating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Antenna Bands
There are slight differences in the placement of the antenna bands. The [[iPhone XR display features | iPhone XR]] is missing a couple of visible bands that are present on the iPhone 10s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This absence means the [[iPhone XR display features | iPhone XR]] does not support gigabit LTE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Bezel
One of the most consistently noticeable design differences is the bezel around the display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. The bezels on the [[iPhone XR display features | iPhone XR]] are a couple of millimeters thicker than those on the iPhone 10s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. While users may get accustomed to them over time, the thinner bezels of the iPhone 10s are preferred for a more modern look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

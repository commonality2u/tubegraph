Information regarding user interface and user experience is limited. However, some aspects of [[Design and Features | design]] and visual display are mentioned in relation to the "voodoo" character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Display and Design Elements
The "voodoo character" is noted for its "ender display" and "design" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, with a further mention of "des pres" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a> which seems to relate to the overall visual presentation or appearance. Additionally, there are references to "screen zone car normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a> and "screen" availabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, suggesting display elements are a component of the user's interaction.

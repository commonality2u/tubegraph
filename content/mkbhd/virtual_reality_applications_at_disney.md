The Walt Disney Company's [[disney_imagineering_labs_visit | Disney Imagineering Labs]] frequently develop experimental and unreleased technologies, some of which have direct [[virtual_reality_vr_and_augmented_reality_ar | virtual reality (VR)]] applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## The HoloTile: An Experimental 360-Degree Treadmill

One significant experimental technology is the HoloTile, a unique, one-of-a-kind 360-degree treadmill that functions as a moving floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. As of its demonstration, it was still in an experimental phase, with only one unit existing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Its design sparks ideas for future applications, particularly in [[virtual_reality_vr_and_augmented_reality_ar | VR]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### How the HoloTile Works

The HoloTile consists of numerous tiny, one-inch discs that spin on top of their bases, resembling miniature treadmills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. These discs turn to match the direction of movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Unlike a traditional one-directional treadmill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, the HoloTile is designed to be responsive and move in any direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

The floor incorporates articulating cones with tilted discs on top, each containing motors to spin the discs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Only the edge of the tilted disc touches the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. When a person walks forward, the discs spin clockwise to move the foot back to the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. When walking backward, they spin counter-clockwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This mechanism ensures that regardless of direction, length, or speed of stride, the user is always pulled back to the middle of the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Controlling the HoloTile

The HoloTile can be controlled in three ways:
*   **Walking on it** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Using a controller** like a PlayStation 5 controller, where the left joystick controls position and the right joystick controls rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Using hand gestures** ("the force") to move objects on the tile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Sensors map movements across a line to control objects on the floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### Walking on the HoloTile

Initially, users can start in a "training mode" at a fraction of the normal speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. The tiles gradually increase their responsiveness over about a two-minute process until they reach 100% real-time speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. While there is a learning curve, users can become comfortable walking on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

Observations about the HoloTile experience:
*   **Loud operation**: The system is currently quite loud, which would need improvement for future theme park or home applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Non-linear movement**: Users are rarely walking in a perfectly straight line, often gliding over the ridges of the discs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. A future version might feature smaller, more numerous discs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **Multiplayer capability**: The HoloTile can support two people at once, demonstrated by its inventor, Lanny Smoot, playing a multiplayer racing game controlling a BB8 by jogging around the course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## HoloTile and [[virtual_reality_vr_and_augmented_reality_ar | VR]]: The Challenge of Motion Sickness

A key application for the HoloTile is in [[virtual_reality_vr_and_augmented_reality_ar | VR]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. However, a challenge with 360-degree treadmills in [[virtual_reality_vr_and_augmented_reality_ar | VR]] is the "disagreement" between what the eyes see and what the body and brain feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

This phenomenon, similar to motion sickness experienced when reading a phone in a moving car, occurs because:
*   **Eyes see movement**: In [[virtual_reality_vr_and_augmented_reality_ar | VR]], the eyes perceive forward motion through a virtual environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Brain feels stationary**: However, because the user is walking in place on the treadmill, their brain does not feel the expected forward movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. This sensory conflict can lead to confusion and motion sickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

When tested with an [[applications_and_ecosystem_of_apple_vision_pro | Apple Vision Pro]] headset, the HoloTile presented this challenge; the visual movement conflicted with the body's stationary feeling, making it difficult to trust the system and walk confidently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Despite the difficulty, the inventor, Lanny Smoot, demonstrated incredible proficiency, confidently exploring a virtual world, possibly a [[innovations_in_theme_park_technology | virtual Disney theme park]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

## Future Potential

The combination of the HoloTile with [[virtual_reality_vr_and_augmented_reality_ar | VR]] headsets represents a vision of the future where users can freeform explore vast virtual spaces while remaining in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. This could enable immersive experiences in users' homes or within future [[innovations_in_theme_park_technology | theme park technologies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. Continued [[developments_and_future_expectations_for_vr_and_ar | development]] of the HoloTile is expected to bring this reality closer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

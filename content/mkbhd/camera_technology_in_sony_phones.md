Sony smartphones, such as the Xperia 1 II, feature advanced camera technology, leveraging Sony's expertise as a leading manufacturer of camera sensors and professional mirrorless cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## Camera Hardware and Specifications

The Xperia 1 II is equipped with triple 12-megapixel cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. This setup includes:
*   A primary lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>
*   A telephoto lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>
*   A truly wide ultra-wide lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>

The front-facing camera records video at 1080p 30 frames per second (fps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## Camera Performance and Features

Sony brings a lot of technology from their Alpha camera line into their phone cameras, particularly focusing on incredible autofocus and extensive manual control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Automatic Mode
When taking photos and videos in the standard automatic mode, users can expect good results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Photos are described as:
*   Very neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>
*   Possessing very good dynamic range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>
*   Having good colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>
*   Featuring fast focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>
*   Sharpness is noted as "okay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>

### Pro-Level Applications
Sony phones include dedicated pro-level photo and video applications:

*   **Photo Pro:** This app shrinks the viewfinder and offers full camera modes and manual control levels, similar to a Sony Alpha camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. It provides:
    *   World-class autofocus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>
    *   Object and eye tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>
    *   Histograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>
    *   Exposure compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>
    *   Metering modes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>
    This level of control requires a learning curve for a touchscreen interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

*   **Cinema Pro:** This app is designed for advanced video recording, allowing users to "make a movie" on their phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Features include:
    *   Wide dynamic range 4K video with profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>
    *   Adjustable manual controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>
    *   ISO control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>
    *   Venice color science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>
    *   Manual focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>
    *   Focus racking: Users can set two focus points (A and B) and have the camera smoothly rack between them without hunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

Additionally, Sony phones include a customizable button that can be used as a shutter button for the camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## Limitations

Despite the advanced [[camera_features_and_performance | camera features and performance]], Sony phones in this series have some notable limitations:
*   **No Simple Night Mode:** They lack a simple night mode for quickly taking great low-light photos, unlike competitors such as Google Pixel's Night Sight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   **Front-Facing Camera:** The front-facing camera's 1080p 30fps capability is seen as a drawback, given the growing importance of front cameras to users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## Market Reception

While Sony makes all the sensors for many popular smartphone cameras, including Pixel and Samsung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, and their Alpha mirrorless cameras (like the a7 III) are highly praised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, their smartphone camera technology faces challenges in gaining broader market appeal.

The extensive manual controls appeal primarily to photography enthusiasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, who represent a very small percentage of the overall smartphone market <a class="yt=" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Most high-end manual control users already own and use dedicated mirrorless cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Therefore, these features, while good for enthusiasts, do not typically attract new mainstream users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

The [[iphone_11_pro_design_and_build | iPhone 11 Pro]] was released in 2019 as Apple's highest-end phone at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Its design and display were noted as slight upgrades from previous models, continuing a familiar trend from the [[display_and_design_of_the_iphone_x | iPhone X]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Design and Build
Initially, early renders and models of the [[iphone_11_pro_design_and_build | iPhone 11 Pro]] were not widely considered attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. However, seeing the device in person offered a different perspective, with the design not looking "horrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

Key design elements include:
*   **Matte Finish** The new matte finish was praised for improving the phone's aesthetic and tactile feel, despite being slightly slipperier than a glossy finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Camera Square** The distinctive camera square was considered the "weird looking part" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. It creates an optical illusion, appearing indented even though it protrudes, and is cut from a single piece of glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The camera square causes the phone to rock slightly when placed on a flat surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Durability** Apple claims the phone features "the toughest glass in any smartphone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. While glass is still susceptible to shattering if dropped, the [[iphone_11_pro_design_and_build | iPhone 11 Pro]]'s matte glass seems less prone to scratching compared to the Pixel 3's matte black glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Front Design** The front of the phone is nearly identical to the previous year's model, featuring the same screen sizes, resolutions, notch, and bezels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. It can be difficult to distinguish from the iPhone 10s when placed side-by-side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Minor Adjustments** The buttons are positioned slightly lower on each phone, potentially making them easier to reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Water Resistance** The phone maintains an IP68 certification for water resistance, with slight upgrades from previous models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Weight and Thickness** The [[iphone_11_pro_design_and_build | iPhone 11 Pro]] is marginally thicker and noticeably heavier than its predecessor, especially the Pro Max, which is 20 grams heavier than the previous year's model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This increased weight is a direct result of incorporating a larger battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Display
The [[iphone_11_pro_display_features | iPhone 11 Pro display features]] several enhancements:
*   **3D Touch Removal** The pressure-sensitive 3D Touch hardware was removed, which freed up internal space for a larger battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Most of its functionality has been replaced by "Haptic Touch," which relies on long presses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Brightness** The display can achieve a sustained brightness of 800 nits and peak at 1200 nits for brief moments in small areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **Contrast Ratio** It boasts a 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **"Super Retina XDR"** Apple branded this improved display as the "Super Retina XDR" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   **Real-world Impact** While general viewing (YouTube, Instagram) might not show a significant difference compared to the iPhone 10s, the improved brightness is noticeable when watching HDR content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Efficiency** The display is also more power-efficient, contributing to improved battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

Despite these improvements, the phone retains the notch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Many users would have preferred a smaller notch over a slight brightness increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

The iPhone 11 Pro's screen, an excellent high-resolution OLED display, continues Apple's tradition of offering great displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

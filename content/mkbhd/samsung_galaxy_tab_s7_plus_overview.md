The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 Plus is an Android tablet considered by some to be a competitor to the iPad Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. There are two models: the Galaxy Tab S7 and the larger S7 Plus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. While Android tablets were once more popular, the Tab S7 Plus offers a premium experience in a less competitive market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## Specifications

The Tab S7 Plus features high-end specifications:
*   **Processor**: Snapdragon 865 Plus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Connectivity**: 5G capable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **RAM**: Up to 8 GB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Storage**: Up to 0.5 TB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **Battery**: 10,090 mAh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Cameras**: Dual rear cameras including a 12-megapixel primary lens and a 5-megapixel ultrawide lens, which are functional for a tablet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. The front-facing camera is positioned in the middle when held in landscape mode, which is ideal for typical tablet use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

## Design

The tablet boasts a nice design with a thin, metal build and sharp edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. It includes quality quad speakers in all four corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. The fingerprint reader is located on the right-hand side, designed for easy unlocking when holding the tablet in landscape mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. The bezels are thin but provide enough space for comfortable thumb placement while holding the device without accidentally touching the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

## S Pen

The Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 Plus comes with an improved S Pen, featuring the same technologies found in the [[spen_features_in_samsung_galaxy_note_10_and_note_10_plus | Galaxy Note series]], including a 9-millisecond response time for low latency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. The S Pen attaches and charges magnetically to the back of the tablet, with the tip needing to face the cameras in a specific spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. However, the magnets are not as strong as some competitors, and the pen's placement can cause the tablet to prop up when laid flat without a case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. A case is recommended for this tablet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

## Display

One of the standout features of the Tab S7 Plus is its display, which is considered the best screen on any tablet, including the iPad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   **Type**: 12-inch Super AMOLED <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **Aspect Ratio**: 16:10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **Refresh Rate**: 120 Hz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **Resolution**: Full Quad HD, which can be used simultaneously with the 120 Hz refresh rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   **Quality**: It gets very bright, offers excellent colors, and makes videos, photos, and games appear super sharp and vibrant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. This display makes it an excellent device for media consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

## Software Experience

As an Android tablet, users should expect some apps to be partially unoptimized, appear vertical, or not be perfectly suited for the tablet format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Despite this common aspect of the Android tablet experience, the overall package, especially with its impressive screen, is still appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

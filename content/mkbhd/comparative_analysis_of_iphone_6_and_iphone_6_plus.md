The iPhone 6 is Apple's flagship phone for the year, released alongside its companion, the iPhone 6 Plus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Design and Build
The iPhone 6 features a new design with a theme of "thin and light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. It is 6.9 millimeters thin, made of one piece of aluminum, and has rounded corners instead of the squared-off edges of the previous iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This gives the phone a seamless feel, but its smoothness, larger size, and lightness can make it feel slippery and reduce confidence when holding it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

The iPhone 6 is a bit bigger than the [[iphone_5s | iPhone 5s]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, sporting a 4.7-inch display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Its thinness, at 6.9 millimeters, is described as "crazy thin" and almost too light to feel like a working phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Due to its extreme thinness, the camera lens on the back protrudes slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

The power button has been moved from the top to the side, which is easier to reach on a larger phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. It also retains a physical mute switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The build is generally well-regarded, and it is not expected to bend in a pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The bottom speaker is loud with decent mids and highs, but it's a small downward-facing driver that is easy to block when holding the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### iPhone 6 Plus Differences
The iPhone 6 Plus is described as an even larger phone in every way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. All factors that make the iPhone 6 a bit slippery and difficult to hold are "amplified" on the iPhone 6 Plus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. It is a 5.5-inch iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a> and is "huge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Display
The iPhone 6 features a 4.7-inch, 1334 x 750 IPS display with excellent colors, great brightness, incredible viewing angles, and a pixel density of 326 ppi (the same as the [[iphone_5s | iPhone 5s]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

iOS 8 is designed to scale everything up from the [[iphone_5s | iPhone 5s]] to take advantage of the larger display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. However, there are no extra features in iOS to specifically utilize the larger display, such as multitasking features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

Apple's "Reachability" feature allows users to double-touch the home button to move the UI halfway down the display for easier one-handed use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## Camera
The iPhone 6 has a "great camera," considered one of the best and fastest in any smartphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Key features include:
*   Fast user interface and picture taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>
*   High frame rate video recording at 30, 60, or 720p, and even 240 frames per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>
*   Fast autofocus with new technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>
*   Fast, wide-open aperture glass for good low-light performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>
*   An 8-megapixel camera on a 1/3-inch sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>
*   Photos are very clean, with a bias towards faster shutter speeds to avoid blurriness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>
*   Top-notch image processing cleans up noise, resulting in "crispy clean shots with excellent color" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>

The main downside of the camera is its 8-megapixel resolution, which means it cannot shoot 4K video (which requires 8.3 megapixels) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

## Performance and Battery Life
The iPhone 6 is equipped with a 1.4 GHz dual-core chip and 1 GB of RAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Despite these numbers, it performs comparably to phones with 2.5 GHz chips and 3 GB of RAM, thanks to Apple's vertical integration and the A8 chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

The iPhone 6 has an 1810 mAh battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. While this is small by other smartphone standards, Apple's optimization of the A8 chip and iOS results in better battery life than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. It offers approximately 10-15% better battery life than the [[iphone_5s | iPhone 5s]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. Standby time is particularly good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. However, on a heavy usage day with significant screen-on time, the phone may not last until the end of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

## Software (iOS 8)
iOS 8 is a familiar user interface to anyone who has used an iPhone or iPad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. It includes improvements to the notification area, allowing users to add permanent widgets for information and shortcuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. The UI has a "nice layer of gloss" with prettied-up reflections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

### Known Issues
*   Some hiccups and bugs can occur in iOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   The iOS 8.0.1 update briefly "bricked" phones before being quickly fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   A significant lag exists in major developers updating their apps for the larger displays of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Un-updated apps look "big and awkward and fuzzy and strange" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

## Conclusion
The iPhone 6 is considered a "safe step forward" and a "definite upgrade" from the last iPhone, but not a mandatory one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Its main physical advantage over older iPhones is the larger screen, providing a bigger UI, text, web browsing, gaming, video watching, and keyboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

The reviewer personally prefers the iPhone 6 Plus, with further details to be discussed in a separate review video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

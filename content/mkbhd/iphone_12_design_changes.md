The [[iphone_12_design_and_aesthetics | iPhone 12]] introduces several key design changes, making it a standout model. While retaining familiar elements like rounded corners, the notch, and the Lightning port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, the overall aesthetic and build have been significantly refined.

## Overall Design and Aesthetics
The [[iphone_12_design_and_aesthetics | iPhone 12]] features a new "super flat" design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, moving away from the "2.5D" curvature at the screen edges seen in previous models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This means the screen is flat right up to the edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

The phone is also slightly thinner and lighter than its [[iphone_11_design_and_features | predecessor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The square sides are noted as the most efficient way to pack internals into the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, contributing to a super premium and modern look and feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Color Options
The Product Red version is described as "kind of red but also kind of salmon sometimes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, with the reviewer personally preferring the blue or black options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Build Materials and Features
The [[iphone_12_design_and_aesthetics | iPhone 12]] retains the IP68 water resistance rating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

Key build elements include:
*   **Aluminum Rails** The "aluminum rails" are highlighted as a significant feature, offering increased grip, though potentially being less comfortable at first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Buttons** The buttons are described as "clicky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, and the power button is slightly larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **5G Antenna Cutout** A 5G antenna cutout is present on the right-hand side in some regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Ceramic Shield
A new material called **Ceramic Shield** is introduced on the front of the [[iphone_12_design_and_aesthetics | iPhone 12]] over the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Composition** It is a specialty hardened glass with a crystal structure inside it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Drop Protection** Ceramic Shield is supposed to offer four times better drop protection, specifically shatter protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   **Scratch Resistance** Typically, shatter resistance and scratch resistance are inversely proportional (softer materials shatter less but scratch easier, and vice versa) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. The reviewer notes that the [[iphone_12_design_and_aesthetics | iPhone 12]] does not seem significantly more scratch resistant than before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, having already observed a small gash on their screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Comparison with [[iphone_12_pro_features | iPhone 12 Pro]]
The [[iphone_12_design_and_aesthetics | iPhone 12]] and [[iphone_12_pro_features | iPhone 12 Pro]] are described as "very similar" in terms of size, with a case for one working for the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The primary differences in design and build are detailed separately in discussions about the [[iphone_12_pro_features | Pro model]].

> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a> "These two phones are very similar, same exact size, like a case that works for one works for the other..."

## MagSafe
MagSafe is a new optional magnetic charging accessory standard located behind the Apple logo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Functionality** The MagSafe puck charger attaches to the back of the phone with magnets, aligning over the Apple logo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. It charges at 15 watts, while other wireless chargers on the iPhone still charge at 7.5 watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Compatibility** The [[iphone_12_design_and_aesthetics | iPhone 12]] still supports Qi wireless charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, and the MagSafe puck can charge other phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. MagSafe charging also works through most thin, non-MagSafe cases, with the magnet still functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Durability Concern** Some users have noted MagSafe leaving marks on the [[iphone_12_design_and_aesthetics | iPhone]], but these appear to wipe off, suggesting it may not be a long-term issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   **Future Implications** MagSafe is seen as Apple's solution for a future "portless iPhone," providing a convenient wireless charging method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## Summary of Design Improvements
The [[iphone_12_design_and_aesthetics | iPhone 12]]'s build quality and [[iphone_12_design_and_aesthetics | design]] are considered an "awesome improvement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>, with the flat design and grippable aluminum rails enhancing both aesthetics and usability.

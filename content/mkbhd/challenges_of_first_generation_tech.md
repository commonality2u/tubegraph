The Apple Vision Pro, while lauded as interesting, risky, and new, clearly exhibits the characteristics of a first-generation product. Unlike previous Apple products like the [[Controversies and challenges faced by iPhone models | iPhone]], Mac, or iPad, the Vision Pro was released with "Pro" already in its name, implying future iterations and developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Despite its impressive features, it comes with inherent downfalls, flaws, and trade-offs that are typical of initial releases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Notable Challenges

### Weight and Comfort
The Vision Pro is notably heavier than other headsets, weighing nearly 650 grams compared to the Quest 3's 515 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. This weight, combined with the design of the Solo Knit strap, concentrates pressure above the eyes and on the cheeks, making it uncomfortable for extended use beyond 30-45 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. The alternative dual loop band, though less aesthetically pleasing, significantly improves comfort by distributing weight to the top of the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

### Field of View Limitations
While the central display is sharp and impressive, the headset's field of view is a significant limitation to immersion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. It presents a "cone effect" with chromatic aberration around the edges, creating a feeling of looking into a large tunnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Apple has not published specific field of view numbers, and the Quest 3 offers a wider field of view by comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### EyeSight Visibility
The EyeSight feature, which displays the user's eyes to the outside world, does not fully achieve its intended purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. The reflective glass of the headset often makes the projected eyes hard to see, and when visible, they are low resolution due to the lenticular display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>. This means it often fails to create a genuine sense of eye contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.

### App Ecosystem
As of its launch, the Vision Pro has a limited app selection with only 600 apps specifically designed for it, although millions of iPad apps are compatible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Many cool concepts for VR/AR experiences, such as gamified cleaning or detailed F1 race viewing, are not yet real applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Key services like YouTube, Netflix, Spotify, and TikTok also lack dedicated Vision Pro apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. This limited app availability is a significant weakness of this first-generation product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

### Technical Limitations
Despite impressive displays and low latency passthrough, the device runs up against the current limits of technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. For instance, while its micro-OLED displays are the sharpest available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, the internal computer cannot render everything in high resolution constantly. It employs foveated rendering, only sharpening what the user is directly looking at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Similarly, while passthrough is the best on any headset, it is still based on cameras and screens, leading to occasional glitches like hand occlusion breaks or floating objects in low light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### Price and Battery Life
The Vision Pro is described as a "really expensive, really fun toy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>, reflecting its high cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Its battery life is also noted as merely "meh" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Symptoms of a First Generation Product
> The Vision Pro demonstrates common symptoms of a first-generation product: it is heavy, has a limited app selection, moderate battery life, and a high price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.

## Comparison to Past Apple Products
Historically, first-generation products from Apple, such as the [[Controversies and challenges faced by iPhone models | iPhone]], Apple Watch, and iPad, also faced downfalls in their initial releases but later achieved success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. The Vision Pro carries a similar "sci-fi, fun nature" that encourages users to overlook its initial flaws, suggesting potential for future success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. The new attention on VR/AR tech sparked by the Vision Pro is expected to accelerate development and improve the value proposition of such devices, including cheaper competitors like the Quest 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>.

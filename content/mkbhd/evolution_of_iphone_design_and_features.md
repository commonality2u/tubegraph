Since its unveiling in 2007, the iPhone has undergone significant transformations in its design and features, influencing the entire smartphone industry. From the original model to the iPhone 13 lineup, Apple has continuously refined its devices, introducing innovations and adapting to market demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## The Original iPhone (2007)

The first iPhone, unveiled by Steve Jobs at Macworld 2007, was a landmark device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Steve Jobs famously described it as "an iPod, a phone, a breakthrough internet communicator" all in one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
It set the tone for future smartphones with its reliance on a multi-touch screen and virtual keyboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

The [[iphone_x_camera_quality_and_features | iPhone 10]] introduces a new front-facing camera suite, which is highlighted as a significant difference from the iPhone 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Located in the notch at the top of the display, this suite includes an IR blaster and a depth sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

### Capabilities Enabled by the Front-Facing Camera Suite
The new front-facing camera suite enables several new features:
*   Face ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>
*   Selfie Portrait Mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>
*   Animojis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>

### Selfie Portrait Mode
The front-facing camera comes with a selfie portrait mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. Early testing indicates that its performance appears "pretty average" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. When compared to the Pixel 2, the Pixel 2 demonstrated more confidence with front-facing camera portraits than the [[iphone_x_camera_quality_and_features | iPhone 10]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

There is a noticeable difference in results, particularly concerning edges and hair in portrait photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. The iPhone 10's portrait mode sometimes struggled to blur the background, being particular about lighting conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. Both devices are expected to improve their portrait mode capabilities with future software updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. Further, in-depth testing of the camera performance and features is planned for a full review of the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

### Animojis
The new front-facing camera suite also introduces Animojis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. With Animojis, users can map their face to a cartoon animal head and send it via iMessage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. The physics of movement within Animojis are described as "pretty on point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.

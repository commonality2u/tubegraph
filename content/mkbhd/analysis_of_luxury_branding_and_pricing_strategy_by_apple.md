Apple employs a unique dual-pronged strategy, balancing competitive pricing in certain product categories with extremely high-priced, seemingly nonsensical accessories. This approach helps the company maintain its image as a premium luxury brand within the technology sector, while also generating significant media attention. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>

## The Mac Pro Wheels: A Case Study

The Mac Pro wheels, sold as a $400 option when configured with a new Mac Pro, or $700 if purchased separately for self-installation, serve as a prime example of Apple's luxury pricing strategy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>

### Product Description
Objectively, these wheels are described as "the nicest computer wheels" and "complete and total overkill." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a> They are entirely metal and rubber, with each wheel weighing more than twice an [[impact_of_iphone_pricing_on_the_market | iPhone 11 Pro]], suggesting they are solid metal. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a> The wheels articulate 360 degrees and feature two independent, smooth rubber treads, enabling a tighter turning radius akin to torque vectoring in a car. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>

### Discrepancy in Value
Despite their high quality, the $700 price tag is deemed excessive, as the material cost does not justify it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a> The functional value is limited to simply making the Mac Pro mobile, despite it needing to be plugged into a wall and lacking brakes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>

One possible explanation for the high price is the significant tooling cost required for such high-quality components combined with an anticipated low sales volume. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a> However, Apple often subsidizes less successful products and does not need to recoup costs on every single item. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>

## The Strategy: Maintaining a Luxury Image

The primary reason for such exorbitant pricing on certain items is to uphold Apple's image as a premium, luxury brand. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>

### Competitive and Luxury Positioning
Apple exists in a competitive tech landscape, where other companies constantly innovate to create the best possible products. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a> This competition has led Apple to offer competitively priced products like the $329 iPad, which is considered an "incredible deal," and the $400 [[pricing_and_value_of_the_iphone_16e | iPhone SE]], noted as one of their best deals ever. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>

However, to maintain its "premium luxury image," Apple also needs high-priced products. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a> This strategy includes choosing to make only the expensive version of certain product categories, such as offering only a high-end desktop tower computer. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>

### Perceived Quality Through Price
Price significantly influences the perceived quality of an item. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a> Studies have shown that when two essentially identical items are presented, people will perceive the higher-priced one as better or of higher quality, even without other context. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>

### Strategic "Sacrifice" for Luxury Status
Apple is uniquely positioned to be competitive where it matters, while simultaneously "sacrificing some products for the memes" in the name of maintaining its luxury status. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a> Products like the Mac Pro wheels are considered a "perfect place to sacrifice" because very few users would purchase them even at a lower price point. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>

### Media Attention
A key benefit of these high-priced, often ridiculed, products is the media attention they generate. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a> "All press is good press" for Apple. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a> Articles criticizing the Mac Pro wheels' cost frequently mention other Apple products, the Mac Pro itself, and Apple's history, effectively providing free advertising and reinforcing [[apples_marketing_strategy_and_media_attention | Apple's marketing strategy]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>

### Other Examples of High-Priced Accessories
Beyond the Mac Pro wheels, other examples of Apple's high-priced accessories that serve this luxury branding purpose include:
*   The $1,000 monitor stand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>
*   The $300 coffee table book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>
*   The $17,000 gold Apple Watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>

While almost no one is expected to buy these items, their existence makes "perfect sense" within Apple's broader strategy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a> The more attention and commentary these "crazy" products receive, the more Apple achieves its goal of increased visibility and reinforced luxury status. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>

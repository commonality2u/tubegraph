iOS 16 introduces significant enhancements to how users interact with text and objects within images and videos, building upon existing functionalities like Live Text and introducing the new Live Objects feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Live Text

The [[live_text_feature_in_ios_15 | Live Text]] feature, originally introduced in iOS 15, allows users to open any picture containing text, immediately recognizing the text and enabling interaction such as copying and pasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### New in iOS 16
With iOS 16, Live Text functionality is extended to videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Users can now pause a video on a frame that contains text and lift that text directly from within the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Live Objects

A notable addition in iOS 16 is "Live Objects," also known as "Lift Subject from Background" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This feature allows users to isolate and lift subjects from photos.

### Core Functionality
In a photo with a discernible subject and background, users can long-press on an object to literally lift it out of the photo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This lifted object can then be copied and pasted into other applications, such as [[new_features_in_ios_17s_messages_and_widgets | Messages]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### Technical Aspects and Impressions
The feature automatically erases the background and performs masking, doing an "amazingly good job" for a one-second background deletion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. It supports virtually any photo, not just Portrait Mode photos shot on an iPhone, and can work with pictures taken on any camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. The iPhone's AI uses impressive object recognition to figure out the subject when there's a reasonable distinction between the subject and background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

### Related Features
The same impressive object recognition AI used in Live Objects is also applied to the new lock screen feature, enabling the clock to "nestle itself between the foreground and the background" of a wallpaper image, creating cool cutouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. This specific clock cutout feature, however, does not work if widgets are added below the time in the current beta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

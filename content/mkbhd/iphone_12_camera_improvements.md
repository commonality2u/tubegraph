The iPhone 12 introduces a slightly updated dual camera system, featuring both a standard and an ultra-wide lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. The standard lens now boasts a wider aperture at f/1.6, compared to the previous f/1.8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

## Photo Quality
While the hardware improvements are "almost impossible to notice in regular photos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, they offer benefits in "edge cases" or more challenging scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. These improvements include:
*   Better handheld performance in low light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
*   Enhanced Night Mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
*   Improved autofocus on fast-moving subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   Superior high dynamic range shots, even when shooting directly into the sun, thanks to Smart HDR 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

Overall, iPhone photos continue to be "some of the absolute best and most consistent crisp photos on any smartphone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

## Video Capabilities
The iPhone 12's video capabilities are considered "firmly in a league of its own" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. The video camera is noted as "so much better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>, being "fine-tuned and so reliable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>, despite not supporting 8K resolution or featuring a large new sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

A minor drawback noted is "more flaring in low light video," appearing as "a ton of little orbs for every little point light source" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

### Dolby Vision HDR Video
A significant advancement is that the new iPhones are the "first cameras the only cameras in the world to shoot 10-bit high dynamic range Dolby Vision 4K video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. HDR video offers "higher brighter brights, deeper shadows, overall better images, even better perceived quality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.

However, a challenge exists with compatibility. While the video looks amazing on the iPhone 12 and when shared with another iPhone 12, uploading to platforms like Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube often results in the video reverting to SDR (standard dynamic range) on most users' screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. The widespread adoption of the iPhone 12 is expected to create an incentive for these platforms to support HDR video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

## Comparison to Other Models
The iPhone 12 shares the "same main cameras" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a> as the iPhone 12 Pro.
Compared to previous generations, the display, which was previously a "huge knock up from last year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>, has seen a "much better screen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

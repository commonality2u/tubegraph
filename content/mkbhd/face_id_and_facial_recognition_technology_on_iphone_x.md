The [[display_and_design_of_the_iphone_x | iPhone X]] marks a significant departure from previous iPhone models, notably by ditching the traditional home button and fingerprint reader. This change necessitated the introduction of [[new_features_of_iphone_x_including_face_id | Face ID]], Apple's facial recognition technology, as the primary method for authentication and unlocking the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

## The Notch: Housing Face ID Sensors

The distinctive "notch" at the top of the [[display_and_design_of_the_iphone_x | iPhone X]] display is where all the front-facing sensors, cameras, an IR blaster, and a depth sensor are housed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This assembly is crucial for [[new_features_of_iphone_x_including_face_id | Face ID]] to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. While some users may dislike the notch, many find that in everyday use, it largely disappears and isn't actively noticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Apple has embraced the notch, promoting software that wraps around it to fill the entire display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## How Face ID Works

[[new_features_of_iphone_x_including_face_id | Face ID]] operates by projecting thousands of tiny infrared dots onto a user's face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. These dots are then read back into the sensor, creating a detailed 3D map of the user's eyes, nose, and mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Notably, it does not use the standard front-facing camera for this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

## Performance and Limitations

[[new_features_of_iphone_x_including_face_id | Face ID]] generally works very well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. While not considered "perfect" like Touch ID's fail rate, it is still impressively good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Touch ID is still faster in terms of raw speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

However, [[new_features_of_iphone_x_including_face_id | Face ID]] has specific physical limitations:
*   **Backlighting/Infrared Light:** It can fail when severely backlit or when there's an excessive amount of infrared light from the sun, which can "blind" the sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Glasses:** It can work through some types of sunglasses, specifically those that allow infrared light to pass through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

Despite these, the instances of failure for [[new_features_of_iphone_x_including_face_id | Face ID]] are relatively few <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. The success rate is estimated to be around 95%, compared to Touch ID's 99% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. [[new_features_of_iphone_x_including_face_id | Face ID]] also has the potential to improve over time with software updates as more users utilize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

## Security Features

[[new_features_of_iphone_x_including_face_id | Face ID]] incorporates several security measures:
*   **Learning Capability:** It can learn and adapt to a changing face over time, recognizing users even after a haircut, shaving a beard, or applying makeup, as these changes don't significantly affect the core "dot map" of the face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
*   **Anti-Spoofing:** It cannot be tricked by a picture of the user because pictures lack the necessary depth information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **Attention Aware:** A setting allows users to require "attention" for unlocking, meaning the phone won't unlock unless the user is actively looking at it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

Ultimately, [[new_features_of_iphone_x_including_face_id | Face ID]] provides a seamless authentication experience, allowing users to unlock the phone, log into apps, make payments, and download apps simply by picking up and looking at the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. If someone else picks up the phone, it won't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

## Animoji

A fun and unique feature exclusive to the [[display_and_design_of_the_iphone_x | iPhone X]] is Animoji <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. These are moving, facial-tracking emojis that can be sent as video messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. Surprisingly, Animoji primarily utilizes the front-facing camera for tracking, and will still function even if the depth sensors are covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. This suggests that Animoji could theoretically be available on other iPhones, but Apple has kept it as a [[new_features_of_iphone_x_including_face_id | iPhone X]] exclusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

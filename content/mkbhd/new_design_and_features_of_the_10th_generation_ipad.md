Apple's 10th Generation Baseline iPad features a significantly updated design and new capabilities, aiming to modernize the entry-level tablet experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. However, some of its choices have been noted as confusing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Design and Display
The new 10th generation iPad adopts a more familiar rectangular shape with flatter sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, moving away from the previous curved design. The home button has been removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, with Touch ID relocated to the top button for biometric unlocking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

Key design changes include:
*   **Thinner Bezels** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>
*   **Larger 11-inch LCD Screen** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   **New Colors** – Available in saturated yellow, pink, blue, and silver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, though the saturation is slightly less intense than depicted on Apple's website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Performance and Connectivity
Internally, the iPad is powered by the A14 Bionic chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, an upgrade from the A13 Bionic found in the 9th generation iPad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. It also features landscape stereo speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a> and Wi-Fi 6 connectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

A significant upgrade is the move to **USB-C** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. While not offering Thunderbolt speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, this port allows for:
*   Connecting USB-C flash drives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
*   Faster charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
*   Plugging in an external display, supporting up to 4K at 30Hz or 1080p at 60Hz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>

## Camera Improvements
The rear camera has been upgraded from 8 megapixels to a 12 megapixel sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Webcam Relocation
One of the most notable changes is the relocation of the webcam to the **long side/bezel** of the iPad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This is considered a significant improvement for video calls, as it makes it appear as though the user is looking directly at the camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

However, this placement decision appears to be a compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, as the [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | M2 iPad Pro]], released concurrently, did not feature the webcam on the long side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## Apple Pencil Compatibility
The 10th generation iPad supports only the first-generation Apple Pencil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This creates a notable inconvenience because the first-generation Apple Pencil uses a Lightning connector for charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, while the new iPad features a USB-C port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

Users must purchase a separate **USB-C to Lightning adapter** to charge the Apple Pencil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This adapter is sold separately and costs $9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, and comes in its own packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

The second-generation Apple Pencil, which charges wirelessly by snapping magnetically to the side of the iPad Air or iPad Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, is not supported. This is due to the new webcam placement occupying the magnetic attachment spot on the long side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Magic Keyboard Folio
Apple released a redesigned two-piece Magic Keyboard Folio specifically for the 10th generation iPad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

This modular accessory consists of:
1.  **Back Plate/Kickstand** – Attaches magnetically to the iPad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, functioning similarly to a Microsoft Surface kickstand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
2.  **Keyboard** – A new keyboard piece with a full function row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. It connects via Smart Connector pins located on the side edge of the iPad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, allowing it to be easily attached or removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
    *   The keyboard can be flipped around for mobile use, preventing the buttons from being felt when holding the iPad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

While this two-piece setup offers modularity for watching movies or typing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, it is less lap-friendly and better suited for stable surfaces like desks due to weight distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

Notably, this new two-piece Magic Keyboard Folio is not available for the [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | iPad Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

## Limitations and Pricing
Despite the USB-C port enabling external display support, the 10th generation iPad does **not** support Stage Manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, limiting advanced multitasking capabilities with external monitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

The pricing strategy for the 10th generation iPad has been a point of confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>:
*   The new iPad starts at **$450** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, a significant price increase from the 9th generation iPad, which remains in Apple's lineup at $329 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   The new Magic Keyboard Folio accessory costs **$250** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   The base model comes with 64GB of storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. An iPad with upgraded storage combined with the Magic Keyboard Folio can reach $850 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, a price point where an [[new_ipad_mini_redesign_and_features | iPad Air]], [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | iPad Pro]], or even a traditional computer could be purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

The existence of the 10th generation iPad alongside the cheaper 9th generation iPad has raised questions about its target audience, as the 9th generation model remains a more economical choice for basic iPad needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

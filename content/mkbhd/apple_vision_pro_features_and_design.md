The [[Apple Vision Pro hardware and design | Apple Vision Pro]] is described as an "interesting," "risky," and "new" product for [[Apple Vision Pro hardware and design | Apple]], contrasting with recent "boring" or "spec bump" product updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. While not fundamentally new as a VR headset, it's new for [[Apple Vision Pro hardware and design | Apple]] and introduces features in a way unique to the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Its release implies a future with successive generations, similar to the iPhone, Mac, and iPad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Notably, it is the first first-generation [[Apple Vision Pro hardware and design | Apple]] product to include "Pro" in its name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Having used the [[Apple Vision Pro hardware and design | Vision Pro]] extensively (for hours with both bands, multiple Macs, in different setups, rooms, indoors and outdoors, and varied lighting conditions), the reviewer notes its "absolutely amazing" and "unparalleled" aspects, alongside its "downfalls and flaws and trade-offs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Display Quality and Eye Tracking

The [[Apple Vision Pro hardware and design | Vision Pro]] features the sharpest, best-looking micro-OLED display among VR headsets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Individual pixels are 7.5 microns, allowing 64 of them to fit into a single iPhone screen pixel, resulting in no visible pixels or "screen door effect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The native refresh rate is 90 hertz, boosting to 96 hertz for 24 FPS content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Each display is factory-calibrated for maximum color accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

Due to the high pixel count, the internal computer cannot render everything in high resolution at all times. Instead, it uses [[user_experience_and_eye_tracking_with_apple_vision_pro | incredibly fast eye tracking]] combined with foveated rendering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This means only the area the user is actively looking at is rendered in high resolution, while the periphery remains soft and fuzzy, mimicking natural human vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This system works effectively, with computing power primarily focused on tracking eye movement to ensure no lag when focusing on different areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Screen recordings from the [[Apple Vision Pro hardware and design | Vision Pro]] can demonstrate this foveated rendering, showing the focused area as sharp and other parts of the same window as intentionally fuzzy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

While developer mode in Xcode allows for 4K screen recordings with everything rendered in high quality, this often results in choppy performance and slow, jittery scrolling, indicating the device is optimized for foveated rendering in real-time use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

### Field of View

A notable limitation of the [[Apple Vision Pro features and specifications | Vision Pro]]'s immersion is its field of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. After initial excitement, users may notice a "ski goggles" effect from the inside, where the edges of the display are narrower than the natural field of vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. This creates a slight "cone effect" and some chromatic aberration around the outside, giving the feeling of "looking into a large tunnel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. [[Apple Vision Pro hardware and design | Apple]] has not published any field of view numbers, and the Quest 3 is noted to have a wider field of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### Passthrough Technology

The [[Apple Vision Pro hardware and design | Vision Pro]] boasts the best passthrough technology of any headset, allowing users to see their real-world environment through the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This feature is seen as a step towards [[Apple Vision Pro hardware and design | Apple]]'s long-term goal of augmented reality (AR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

The passthrough uses the "highest quality camera feeds" and "highest quality displays" to create a near-transparent experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The sharpness, colors, and extremely low latency are so good that users report no eye fatigue, even after prolonged use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This enables seamless interaction with the real world, such as picking up objects, walking between rooms without tripping, and even playing table tennis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

The total latency from outside light hitting sensors to the image being updated and hitting the eyeballs is incredibly fast at 12 milliseconds, which includes camera exposure time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. This speed is attributed to the specially designed R1 chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

Despite its quality, the passthrough is still reliant on cameras and screens. It manages various lighting situations impressively, prioritizing smoothness and high shutter speeds, though this can lead to increased noise in darker environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Minor imperfections include occasional hand occlusion breaks or janky visuals when hands are placed in front of objects, and objects may float slightly more in low light conditions compared to their usual perfect positional tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### Comfort and Design (Weight and Straps)

The [[Apple Vision Pro hardware and design | Vision Pro]] is not the most comfortable headset, primarily due to its weight and strap design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. It weighs approximately 25% more than many other headsets, such as the Quest 3 (515 grams), coming in at nearly 650 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. Despite this, the internal design is highly efficient, utilizing lightweight materials like carbon fiber and magnesium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.

The main issue contributing to discomfort is the Solo Knit strap, which is prominently featured in marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. While visually appealing, quick to adjust, and minimally disruptive to hair, this strap concentrates all the headset's weight on two pressure points above the eyes and on the cheeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. Tightening the strap to prevent light leaks further exacerbates this discomfort, making it difficult to wear for more than 30-45 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. The unique adjustment wheel for tightening cables in the strap is an innovative design element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

[[Apple Vision Pro hardware and design | Apple]] includes a second strap, the dual loop band, in the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. While less aesthetically pleasing, more disruptive to hair, and harder to adjust than the Solo Knit band, the dual loop band significantly improves long-term comfort by distributing pressure to the top of the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. This allows for extended usage, such as a two-hour podcast recording, which would be impossible with the Solo Knit band <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. The Solo Knit band is better for short, quick uses, while the dual loop band is essential for extended wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.

### EyeSight (External Eye Display)

The EyeSight feature, which displays the user's eyes on the outside of the headset via a lenticular display, is intended to allow external observers to see the user's eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. However, it often fails to achieve its intended effect. The smooth, reflective glass of the headset frequently causes light reflections that obscure the displayed eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>. Even when visible, the image is low-resolution due to the lenticular display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. Consequently, it rarely provides a sense of actual eye contact, especially for individuals with darker skin tones, differing significantly from [[Apple Vision Pro hardware and design | Apple]]'s advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. There is speculation about whether [[Apple Vision Pro hardware and design | Apple]] will refine or remove EyeSight in future generations, especially with a potential less expensive "[[Apple Vision Pro hardware and design | Apple Vision]]" model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.

### Overall Assessment

The [[Apple Vision Pro hardware and design | Vision Pro]] is described as a "really expensive, really fun toy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. While enjoyable for media consumption, gaming, and productivity (like editing videos on a Mac with a gigantic virtual screen), it still exhibits many characteristics of a first-generation product: it's heavy, has limited app selection, mediocre battery life, and a high [[pricing_and_potential_market_for_apple_vision_pro | price]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.

Its potential future success is compared to the first-generation iPhone, Watch, and iPad, which also had initial drawbacks but became highly successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. The [[Apple Vision Pro hardware and design | Vision Pro]] possesses a compelling "sci-fi" appeal, particularly in its hand control and virtual window manipulation, that could drive consumer interest despite its current flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

The attention brought by [[Apple Vision Pro hardware and design | Apple]] to the VR/AR space is expected to benefit cheaper competitors like the $500 Quest 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. It is also anticipated to accelerate the development of cooler and more awesome applications, significantly improving the value proposition of the $3,500 headset over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.

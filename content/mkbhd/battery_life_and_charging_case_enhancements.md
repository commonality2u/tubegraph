*   A total of up to 30 hours of listening time when combined with the charges provided by the [[battery_life_and_charging | battery]] in the charging case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

## Charging Case Innovations
The charging case for AirPods Pro 2 features several notable upgrades that enhance usability and findability:

### Design and Durability
*   The case maintains the same size and shape as the previous generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
*   A new lanyard loop is integrated on the side, allowing users to attach it to other items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
*   The case retains its IPX4 water resistance rating, offering protection against sweat and rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.
*   Users can now engrave their case with a Memoji for personalization and identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

### Enhanced Findability

*   This speaker works in conjunction with Precision Finding, powered by the U1 chip, similar to an AirTag, guiding users to the exact location of the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   The speaker also plays a sound when the case is placed on a wired or wireless charger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.
*   The H2 chip enables the case to play a chime and trigger a "mismatched AirPods" notification on the phone if a wrong earbud is accidentally placed in the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.

### Versatile Charging
*   The case continues to support MagSafe wireless charging, with the MagSafe ring ensuring it stays securely in place on compatible charging pucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.
*   A new feature allows the case to be charged using Apple Watch chargers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra features one of the best screens available on any phone in 2024, setting a new standard for flagship slab phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. It is designed to maximize every possible value, pushing its display capabilities to the extreme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

## Display Technology and Design
The S24 Ultra is equipped with a class-leading 6.8-inch Quad HD AMOLED display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. Like previous Ultra phones, it features a 120Hz LTPO refresh rate and sharp Quad HD resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

Key advancements in the [[display_and_screen_updates | display technology and design]] for the S24 Ultra include:
*   **Completely Flat Display** The screen is now entirely flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>, extending right up to the very corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.
*   **Thinner Bezels** It boasts some of the thinnest bezels seen all the way around the display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.
*   **Anti-Reflective Coating** A new anti-reflective coating on the Gorilla Glass Armor makes a noticeable difference, especially when light hits it at off-axis angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

## Brightness and Dimness
The S24 Ultra's display is significantly brighter than previous models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. It achieves a maximum brightness of 2,600 nits, making it exceptionally visible outdoors or in bright environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

In addition to its high brightness, the display can also get extremely dim at night without exhibiting any of the weird banding seen in some other phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

> "If you're a screen snob, it doesn't really get better than this one right here. This is the phone you should get." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>

## Fingerprint Reader
Underneath the display, the S24 Ultra includes a crazy fast ultrasonic fingerprint reader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. The only minor point of feedback is that the touch target for the reader could be slightly bigger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

## Always On Display
The S24 Ultra features a new [[display_and_screen_updates | Always On Display]] that, similar to the iPhone, doesn't just show the time but also the user's entire wallpaper, appearing "half awake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:23:00">[15:23:00]</a>. This feature can be turned off to conserve battery life, akin to the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:25:00">[15:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>.

## Comparison to Other Phones
The S24 Ultra's display capabilities position it as a top contender, even against phones like high-end Oppo or Xiaomi devices, which are often considered for their exceptional screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. While the [[iphone_12_pro_display_and_screen_technology | iPhone 15 Pro Max]] was not directly compared in this context due to being an iOS device, Samsung has adopted several design and display features reminiscent of the iPhone, including the flattened screen and boxier corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:00">[15:09:00]</a>.

## S24 Plus Display Comparison
The Samsung S24 Plus, a more affordable option in Samsung's own lineup, features a 6.7-inch display, slightly smaller than the S24 Ultra's 6.8-inch screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:00">[16:49:00]</a>.

The Samsung Galaxy Fold, a groundbreaking folding phone, was initially announced in February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Upon its release to review units, several devices, including the reviewer's, began breaking for various reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. In response to these [[common_issues_and_fixes_in_the_galaxy_fold|issues]], Samsung recalled all review units to investigate and address the problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Despite initial doubts and [[samsung_galaxy_fold_relaunch_rumors|rumors]] that the phone might be canceled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, Samsung brought back an updated and fixed version, which began shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

While the new model is very similar to the original, several key [[features_of_the_updated_galaxy_fold|design changes]] were implemented to improve durability and prevent issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Key Design Changes in the Updated Model

Samsung implemented specific modifications to address the initial vulnerabilities of the device:

*   **Extended Protective Layer**
    The thin layer that appeared to be a screen protector but is actually an integral part of the display has been extended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. It now reaches all the way to the edges and is tucked underneath the display bezel, preventing users from mistaking it for a removable screen protector and attempting to peel it off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Added T-Shaped Hinge Caps**
    New T-shaped caps have been added at the top and bottom of the display, specifically at the hinge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. These caps are designed to prevent dust and debris from entering the hinge mechanism itself, a critical vulnerability in the original design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Reduced Hinge Gap**
    The gap created by the hinge when the phone is closed is now slightly smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. While a crack is still visible through the middle, it's barely noticeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Firmer Hinge Mechanism**
    The hinge mechanism itself feels more firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. The updated model exhibits a more solid snap when unfolded flat and when unsnapping it from the flat position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## Unchanged Aspects

Despite the improvements, some [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design|design elements]] and characteristics remain the same:

*   **Display Material**: The display still utilizes a soft plastic material, as it must be able to fold in half in ways that hard glass cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Display Crease**: The crease in the middle of the folding display appears to be about the same as the original <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Durability Warning**: A new warning is included during the setup process, advising users to avoid pressing the screen hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This is because applying too much pressure or scratching the protective layer with fingernails can still damage the [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design|Galaxy Fold]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Implications of Changes

Samsung's approach to the [[samsungs_response_to_galaxy_fold_problems|Galaxy Fold problems]] involved acknowledging the issues, recalling all units before they reached customers, and working internally to fix them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This proactive [[samsungs_response_to_galaxy_fold_issues|response]] is contrasted with companies that might attribute issues to user error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

The initial problems highlighted a [[folding_phone_design_challenges|challenge]] in product development: real-world user interaction often exposes issues not anticipated in lab testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Users might fold the phone with items inside, place it in lint-filled pockets, or expose it to environments like sandy beaches, leading to failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

Even with the fixes, the updated [[samsung_galaxy_fold_features_and_design|Galaxy Fold]] remains a delicate phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. However, its relaunch signifies Samsung's strong belief in the future of the [[implications_of_galaxy_fold_failures_for_foldable_phones|foldable phone form factor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. The device is still appreciated for its unique experience in gaming, web browsing, email, and multitasking on its large, pocketable display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

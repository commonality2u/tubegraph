The [[iPhone 13 Pro]] is expected to receive ProRes video recording capabilities through a future software update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. ProRes is a high-quality video codec widely used in the professional video industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. This feature will allow users to shoot professional-grade video directly from their phone, integrate it with footage from other cameras, and easily edit it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

## Resolution and Storage Considerations
ProRes video recording will be available in 4K resolution at 30 frames per second (fps) on most [[iPhone 13 Pro]] models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. However, the 128GB base storage versions of the [[iPhone 13 Pro]] will be limited to 1080p at 30fps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. This limitation might be due to the large file sizes associated with 4K ProRes video (approximately 6GB per minute) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>, which could quickly fill up smaller storage capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. Another potential reason is that the slower storage used in lower-tiered models might not support the high data rate required for 4K ProRes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

To record 4K ProRes video on an [[iPhone 13 Pro]], users will need to purchase a model with at least 256GB of storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. Storage options for the [[iPhone 13 Pro]] go up to 1TB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

## Offloading and Workflow
A significant challenge with recording large ProRes files on the [[iPhone 13 Pro]] is the offloading process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. Transferring these massive files to a computer via the Lightning port is expected to be very slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. This slow transfer speed makes it less ideal for a professional workflow, especially when compared to devices that use faster connectivity like USB-C or Thunderbolt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

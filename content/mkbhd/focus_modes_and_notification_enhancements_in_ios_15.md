[[ios_15_new_features_overview | iOS 15]], unveiled at WWDC about a month prior to the video's release, introduces several new features and improvements to the iPhone's software experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Among the most significant changes are enhancements to notifications and the introduction of Focus Modes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Notifications

While noting that Android's notifications have historically been superior, [[ios_15_new_features_overview | iOS 15]] brings key improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

*   **Redesigned Visuals**
    Notifications in [[ios_15_new_features_overview | iOS 15]] feature a new design with larger photo icons and app icons to the left, creating a significant visual difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   **Notification Summary**
    A new feature called "Notification Summary" gathers all low-priority notifications into one place, particularly useful after waking up or a period of inactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. The exact criteria for what qualifies as low-priority for the summary were still being clarified at the time of the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

## Focus Modes

Focus Mode offers enhanced control over notifications and device usage, working universally across all Apple devices, including iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, and Mac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

*   **Functionality**
    When Focus Mode is activated, the person messaging you can see that your notifications are silenced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. It functions almost like separate profiles, allowing different notifications from specific apps and people to be let through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. For example, "Do Not Disturb" silences almost everything, "Work" mode restricts notifications from "fun" apps, and "Personal" mode restricts notifications from "work" apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Customization and Automation**
    Users can customize which apps and people can send notifications in each mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Focus Modes can be set to automatically turn on or off based on location or time of day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Home Screen Integration**
    A key customization feature allows users to choose specific [[new_home_screen_features_in_ios_14 | Home Screen]]s to appear only when a particular Focus Mode is active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. This means a user can have a [[new_home_screen_features_in_ios_14 | Home Screen]] for work that doesn't display social media apps, and a different one for personal time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Users can create as many Focus Modes as they wish, such as for the gym, driving, reading, or gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **Device Syncing**
    All Focus Mode customizations sync across all linked Apple devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. For instance, enabling work Focus Mode on your phone will activate it across all your devices, and similarly, when home mode is triggered automatically by location, all devices will revert to personal notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

Overall, [[ios_15_new_features_overview | iOS 15]] is viewed as a positive update, offering a better look and feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

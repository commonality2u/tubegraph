The [[Playstation 5 unboxing and design | PlayStation 5]] (PS5) features a design that is described as huge, eye-catching, and very intentional, aiming to convey a new generation of console gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Design Philosophy and Aesthetic Elements
The console, along with its [[dualsense_controller_features_and_design | controller]] and official [[playstation_5_accessories_overview | headphones]] and accessories, adopts a distinct black and white motif <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Even the controller dock is designed to resemble a mini PS5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This design choice is considered risky, as it may not fit every home aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

Specific design elements include:
*   **Matte white sides** The matte white sides are generally liked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Blue LED** The blue LED glowing is considered cool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Glossy black middle** The glossy black middle section is perceived as the cheapest part and is prone to fingerprints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

The overall design is seen as a statement piece intended to stand out next to a TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This "crazy design" has both a "higher ceiling" and a "lower floor" for its aesthetic appeal compared to a safer design like that of the Xbox One, meaning it can look amazing if placed in a room where it belongs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### User Interface (UI)
The console's UI has been redesigned, featuring particles and lights, and looks impressive on high-resolution TVs, especially in HDR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Console Orientation and Stand Use
The PS5 comes with a black plastic stand, designed for use in both vertical and horizontal modes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. For optimal airflow, it is recommended to use the stand at all times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The stand features a swiveling hidden screw design, allowing it to be set up once for a chosen orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

While the stand is necessary for horizontal placement to prevent wobbling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, vertical placement can be done without the stand, as it doesn't completely block ventilation and still looks good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

The [[Playstation 5 size and weight comparison | PlayStation 5]] is notably small for what it offers, especially when compared to a [[comparison_between_ps5_and_gaming_pcs | gaming PC]] with similar (though not identical) capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

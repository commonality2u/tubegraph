From: [[mkbhd]] <br/> 

YouTube Rewind, initially perceived as an annual celebration of the platform's top content, creators, and memes, has undergone a significant shift in sentiment, particularly evident with [[criticism_of_youtube_rewind_2018 | YouTube Rewind 2018]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This specific installment became the second most disliked video ever uploaded to YouTube, surpassing even Justin Bieber's "Baby" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The prevailing issue, from a creator's standpoint, stems from a fundamental difference in perception between the YouTube community and YouTube itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## The Disconnect

For creators and audiences, [[youtube_rewind_concept_and_evolution | YouTube Rewind]] is viewed as a retrospective celebration of the biggest YouTubers, events, and trends that occurred on the site throughout the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Being included in Rewind became an honor for many creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. However, as YouTube grew into a massive company needing to generate revenue, its perspective on Rewind evolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

YouTube began to see Rewind primarily as a showcase for advertisers, highlighting "advertiser friendly" content and "super clean creators" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. In the era of "brand safety" and "adpocalypse," maintaining a strong [[YouTubes relationship with advertisers | relationship with advertisers]] became paramount, transforming Rewind into a "giant ad for YouTube" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This divergence in purpose is the core reason for the community's widespread dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Notable Exclusions and Inclusions (Rewind 2018)

The impact of this shift was glaringly evident in [[criticism_of_youtube_rewind_2018 | YouTube Rewind 2018]]. Major YouTube figures and events that were significant on the platform were notably absent, including:
*   PewDiePie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
*   Shane Dawson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
*   The KSI vs. Logan Paul fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>

Conversely, figures like Will Smith, Trevor Noah, and John Oliver were featured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. While Will Smith has a YouTube presence, these individuals are not primarily considered "YouTubers" in the traditional sense, and their inclusion was perceived as an attempt to appeal to advertisers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Evolution of Rewind's Style

The stylistic choices of [[youtube_rewind_concept_and_evolution | YouTube Rewind]] have also contributed to its problematic reception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. A [[comparison_of_youtube_rewind_through_the_years | comparison of YouTube Rewind through the years]] reveals a progression from simple to chaotic:

*   **YouTube Rewind 2011**: The first Rewind, it was a simple two-minute video featuring Rebecca Black counting down the top 10 most viewed videos, ending with "Friday" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. It featured one creator and one song <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **YouTube Rewind 2012**: The first year to bring creators in for new content, it was a four-minute "Gangnam Style" remix, with a clear list of featured creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This was considered "peak Rewind as far as actual video style" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   **YouTube Rewind 2013**: This was the first year produced by Portal A, a production company, and arguably the first time Rewind started to be used to appeal to advertisers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. It introduced a mash-up style, was six minutes long, featured six songs, and included 56 creators, plus Cookie Monster and Jimmy Kimmel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   **YouTube Rewind 2014 onwards**: The trend continued with more creators (95 in 2014), more songs, and faster editing, creating a sense of "absolute chaos" as more elements were "shoved in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **YouTube Rewind 2017**: Reached its peak length at seven minutes, featuring a "barrage" of content including late-night talk show hosts, creators, and traditional celebrities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## Creator Experience in Rewind 2018

Despite the negative reception of previous years, the director of Rewind 2018 conveyed intentions to make it different, reducing the number of creators from hundreds to around one hundred and giving creators "a voice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. However, the outcome was still a "chaotic barrage of clips that's just really hard to watch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

One creator, MKBHD, who has been in Rewind for several years, shared his personal experience:
*   He spent 12-14 hours on set in LA, shooting multiple takes of jumping out of the Fortnite bus with other creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   He performed a stunt, harnessed and on a zip line, falling out of the bus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   A whole clip existed of him landing, reacting to his costume, understanding the flying bus, and realizing Will Smith put him there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   This extensive shooting was ultimately cut down to a brief, almost incomprehensible moment in the final video, failing to convey the full context or effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

This experience exemplifies the problem: while YouTube attempts to include "hundreds of things" to make everyone happy, the rapid-fire montage style makes it difficult to appreciate any single contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

## Conclusion and Proposed Solution

The fundamental flaw of [[youtube_rewind_concept_and_evolution | YouTube Rewind]] is its attempt to simultaneously appeal to advertisers by excluding anything controversial, while also trying to satisfy creators by including hundreds of snippets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. This approach makes the deliberate exclusions of popular creators and moments even more obvious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

To fix Rewind, creators suggest YouTube must accept that it cannot make everyone happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. The proposed solution is to embrace **cutting things out** and **hand-selecting** a few key moments and creators that truly represented YouTube that year, akin to the simpler, more focused style of earlier Rewind videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. This would allow for a more cohesive and meaningful celebration of the platform's actual highlights.

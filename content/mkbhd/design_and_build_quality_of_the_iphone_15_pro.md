The [[New features and hardware of iPhone 15 Pro | iPhone 15 Pro]] and iPhone 15 Pro Max feature notable changes in their design and build quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. These updates are described as "welcome stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a> and primarily focus on build quality, the internal chip, and cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## Materials and Weight
The Pro models have transitioned from a glossy, fingerprint-prone stainless steel to a new grade 5 titanium alloy with a brushed texture for the rails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. This change makes the iPhone 15 Pro "noticeably lighter in the hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

## Dimensions and Bezels
The new material and design have allowed Apple to slightly shrink the body of the Pro iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. While maintaining the same screen sizes, the displays now extend closer to the edges, resulting in slightly thinner bezels, which is a noticeable improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

## Durability
While titanium is technically stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, the speaker believes this material change won't significantly impact overall durability in the way some might expect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. The primary point of failure for iPhones, especially those with stainless steel rails (like previous Pro models), is the glass, not the metal frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. The [[iPhone 15 Pro design and build changes | iPhone 15 Pro]] retains the same Ceramic Shield glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, meaning drops on the glass will still lead to "not great results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

## Colors
The new colors for the iPhone 15 Pro models include:
*   Black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>
*   White <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>
*   A subtle new Blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>
*   "Natural," which embraces a raw titanium feel, reminiscent of the "Starlight" color with a warm tone, and is favored by the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## Repairability
Apple has redesigned "a bit of the interior of the chassis" of the iPhone 15 Pro to make the back glass more easily replaceable, indicating a step towards a more repairable iPhone design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

## Action Button
A significant new physical feature exclusive to the Pro iPhones is the "Action Button" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. This customizable button replaces the iconic mute switch and is located in the same spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

By default, it functions as a mute switch, requiring a hold to toggle between muted and ringer-on states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. However, it offers extensive customization options within the settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>:
*   Maintain mute switch functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>
*   Switch in and out of Focus Modes (e.g., Do Not Disturb) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>
*   Auto-launch the camera, with the option to choose a specific camera mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>
*   Toggle the flashlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>
*   Open voice memos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>
*   Toggle the magnifier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>
*   Trigger a Siri Shortcut, allowing it to potentially launch almost any app on the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

The speaker expresses pleasant surprise at the depth of customization for the Action Button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

The iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max feature significant advancements in their display technology, marking a substantial upgrade over previous models. While retaining similar sizes and resolutions to the previous year, these Pro models introduce key innovations in brightness, color accuracy, and refresh rate technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Display Specifications and Features

The display on the iPhone 13 Pro is noticeably brighter than the standard iPhone 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. It reaches a maximum brightness of 1,000 nits, compared to 800 nits on the iPhone 13, and achieves a peak brightness of 1,200 nits with HDR content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This enhanced brightness makes the screen highly viewable in various conditions, including bright outdoors, and features responsive auto-brightness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. The display remains one of the most color-accurate OLED panels available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

A notable design change is the presence of a smaller notch, which slightly improves the aesthetics on the larger screen, though it doesn't add more usable information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## ProMotion Technology

The most significant upgrade to the [[iPhone 13 Pro features and innovations | iPhone 13 Pro]] screen is the inclusion of Apple's ProMotion technology, an adaptive high refresh rate display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This feature allows the display to dynamically adjust its refresh rate, rather than being fixed at 120Hz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

Key aspects of ProMotion:
*   **Adaptive Refresh Rate**  
    The iPhone 13 Pro utilizes an LTPO (Low-Temperature Polycrystalline Oxide) OLED panel, enabling it to vary its refresh rate from as high as 120 Hz down to as low as 10 Hz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. It supports 12 different refresh rates, seven more than the [[iPad Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment**  
    The display intelligently responds to on-screen activity:
    *   Watching a 24 FPS movie: The display refreshes 24 times per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
    *   Scrolling through content (e.g., websites, social media): The refresh rate ramps up to ensure smoothness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
    *   Gaming: The display is pinned at 120 Hz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
    *   Static content (e.g., home screen, reading text): The refresh rate drops to 10 Hz to conserve battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Impact on User Experience

The implementation of ProMotion on the iPhone 13 Pro is considered well-executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Many first-party apps and iOS animations benefit from the 120Hz refresh rate, resulting in a smoother and more responsive overall experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Apple has also provided detailed instructions to developers to help them update their third-party apps to fully support ProMotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### User Perception of High Refresh Rate

While millions of people using the [[iPhone 13 Pro features and innovations | iPhone 13 Pro]] will experience a high refresh rate screen for the first time, not everyone immediately notices ProMotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Some users might observe text staying more crisp during scrolling or generally improved smoothness and touch responsiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. However, once users become accustomed to the 120Hz refresh rate, they are likely to find it difficult to return to a 60Hz display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

### Battery Life Benefits

The LTPO display, with its ability to drop to low refresh rates, contributes significantly to the [[battery_life_improvements_in_iphone_13 | iPhone 13 Pro's improved battery life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. This, combined with the efficient A15 Bionic chip and a physically larger battery, makes the iPhone 13 Pro models battery champions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

## Limitations and Minor Details

*   **Third-Party App Support**  
    Some third-party applications may not yet fully utilize the 120Hz refresh rate and might remain at 60Hz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Limiting Frame Rate**  
    Users can manually limit the display's refresh rate to 60Hz by navigating through Accessibility settings (Motion > Limit Frame Rate), although this may not yield significant battery savings given the display's adaptive nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

Despite a few minor issues like the notch and the need for some apps to be updated, the iPhone 13 Pro's screen is considered one of the best-looking displays on any smartphone due to its color accuracy, brightness, and smoothness provided by ProMotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

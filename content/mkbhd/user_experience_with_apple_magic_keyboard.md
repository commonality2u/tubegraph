The [[new_magic_keyboard_folio_for_ipad|Apple Magic Keyboard]] is touted as the most interesting case seen in a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, priced at $300 for the small version and $350 for the larger one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Its announcement alongside the new iPad and the introduction of mouse and cursor support for iPadOS reignited the debate about whether the iPad Pro could serve as a full-time computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Having used the new iPad Pro with this case as a primary computer for several days, the conclusion is that it offers the best version of the iPad as a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, though the reviewer still prefers a traditional laptop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## [[design_and_build_quality_of_apple_magic_keyboard|Design and Build Quality]] and [[apple_magic_keyboard_case_features|Features]]

The [[new_magic_keyboard_folio_for_ipad|Apple Magic Keyboard]] is a substantial and well-built accessory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. It features:
*   **Magnetic Attachment** A top part with strong magnets securely locks onto the iPad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Hinge System** A long metal tube hinge in the middle allows the iPad to float above the keyboard once attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The hinge has a stiff locking point that snaps into place, allowing the top part to continue opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Pass-through USB-C Port** Located on the side of the hinge for charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, offering almost 100% charging efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Material** The base is made of a silicon rubberized material, similar to other Apple cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Integrated Keyboard and Trackpad** It includes a full-size backlit keyboard and a trackpad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Weight and Portability
The case adds significant weight; the larger iPad Pro weighs 640 grams, and the case itself weighs 702 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Combined, the iPad Pro with the Magic Keyboard is thicker and heavier than a MacBook Air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Keyboard and Trackpad Experience
The keyboard is considered the nicest part of the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>:
*   **Scissor Switches** Provides nice travel and a clicky feel, similar to new MacBook Air and 16-inch MacBook Pro keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Stiffness** The board is stiff with no flex, unlike some laptops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Backlighting** It is backlit, which uses some extra power from the iPad's battery, but it's a nice touch that fades on and off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. It is described as the best keyboard seen in an iPad case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

The trackpad, while not as large as a full-size laptop trackpad, is functional and completes the laptop feel with the new [[software_and_user_experience|iOS]] cursor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. It provides a physical click everywhere from corner to corner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## Limitations and Quirks
Despite its strengths, the [[new_magic_keyboard_folio_for_ipad|Apple Magic Keyboard]] presents several limitations:
*   **Top-Heaviness** Since the iPad is the computer, most of the weight is at the top, making it feel a bit top-heavy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The case's added weight attempts to mitigate this, but it's not perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **Lappability** While it is "lappable" in most classic laptop positions and better than expected, it is not as flexible as a truly bottom-weighted laptop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Missing Keys**
    *   **No Escape Key** Users must touch the screen to exit full-screen video or other functions typically handled by an escape key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
    *   **No Function Buttons** There are no shortcuts for brightness, volume, or keyboard backlight control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Adjusting keyboard brightness requires navigating deep into the settings app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, though auto-brightness usually works well by utilizing the iPad's sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **App Management** The Command-Q shortcut does not quit apps directly from within them; users must touch the screen or use Command-H to go home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. To close an app without touching the screen, one must access the Command-Tab menu, find the app, and then use Command-Q <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Learning Curve** There's a learning curve for trackpad gestures and keyboard shortcuts with iPadOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Holding down Command reveals a list of available shortcuts for the current app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **Multitasking Challenges** Basic multitasking, like playing music and taking notes during a Zoom call, is difficult on the iPad compared to a laptop due to the lack of dedicated controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

## Comparison to Laptops
The reviewer's MacBook Air costs $1200, while the 13-inch iPad Pro (same screen size) with the $350 Magic Keyboard totals $1350 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
While the iPad Pro with the Magic Keyboard offers a 120Hz screen, more apps, and cameras, making it "more fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, the reviewer still requires a laptop for certain tasks, especially multitasking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

## Conclusion
The [[new_magic_keyboard_folio_for_ipad|Apple Magic Keyboard]] is ideal for those who primarily use their iPad as a tablet but occasionally need to type, allowing them to easily attach the keyboard for a "typing machine" experience and then detach it to return to tablet mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. For this type of user, it is the "best possible version of the iPad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. However, for users who need a full-fledged computer for complex multitasking, it does not fully replace a laptop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

The [[apple_magic_keyboard_case_features | Apple Magic Keyboard]] for the iPad Pro is described as a "substantial" and "nice" case with a complex design [00:01:15]. It is considered one of the most interesting cases available [00:00:23].

### Design and Build
The case consists of several key components:
*   **Top Part** The top section is filled with strong magnets that securely lock onto the iPad, ensuring it does not detach easily [00:01:19].
*   **Hinge** A "long metal tube" forms the hinge, providing a sturdy connection [00:01:28]. This hinge is "pretty stiff like a laptop" [00:02:47] and has a locking point that snaps into place when opened [00:02:18]. While its backward motion is limited, it extends far enough for typical use [00:02:51].
*   **USB-C Port** A USB Type-C pass-through port is integrated into the side of the hinge, allowing for charging [00:01:31]. This port offers nearly 100% charging efficiency [00:04:09].
*   **Base** The base is constructed from a "silicon rubberized material," similar to what has been seen in other Apple cases [00:01:36]. This base houses a full-size backlit keyboard and a trackpad [00:01:40].
*   **Connection** When the iPad is attached, everything lights up, and the pins connect, allowing the iPad to float above the keyboard [00:02:34].

### Weight and Dimensions
The [[apple_magic_keyboard_case_features | Apple Magic Keyboard]] is made from "a lot of material," making it thicker and heavier than one might expect [00:01:43]. The larger version of the case weighs 702 grams on its own [00:01:57]. When combined with the 640-gram iPad Pro, the total weight and thickness exceed that of a MacBook Air [00:02:00]. This added weight in the base is intentionally designed to counteract the iPad's weight, which sits at the top, to reduce the top-heavy feel [00:04:57].

### Keyboard and Trackpad
*   **Keyboard** The keyboard is equipped with scissor switches, providing a pleasant travel and a "clicky" feel, akin to the keys found on newer MacBook Air and 16-inch MacBook Pro models [00:03:04]. The board itself is stiff and well-built, preventing any flex during typing [00:03:11]. It is also backlit, which draws some power from the iPad's battery, but it features a pleasant fading effect [00:03:19]. The keyboard is described as the "best keyboard" seen in an iPad case [00:03:29]. However, it lacks an escape key and dedicated function buttons for brightness, volume, or keyboard backlight control, requiring users to interact with the screen or navigate through settings for these adjustments [00:05:31].
*   **Trackpad** The trackpad is not as large as those found on full-size laptops [00:03:33] but is functional and completes the "laptop computer feel" [00:03:39]. It offers a physical click that works consistently from corner to corner [00:03:47].

### Usability and Form Factor
While well-built [00:02:11], the combined unit is not as elegant to open and close as a traditional laptop due to the iPad's weight being at the top [00:02:06]. This top-heavy design means it's "not perfect" for all positions, though it is "labile" in many classic laptop positions, performing better than expected [00:05:06].

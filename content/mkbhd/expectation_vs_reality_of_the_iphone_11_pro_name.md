The [[iphone_11_pro_design_and_build | iPhone 11 Pro]] and [[iphone_11_pro_design_and_build | iPhone 11 Pro Max]] are Apple's new flagship iPhones, introduced at a starting price of $999 and $1099, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The "Pro" designation in the name has generated mixed feelings, as the features included may not fully align with a "pro" expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Unfulfilled "Pro" Expectations

Despite the "Pro" moniker, several features often associated with professional-grade devices were notably absent from the [[iphone_11_pro_design_and_build | iPhone 11 Pro]] lineup:
*   **ProMotion Display**: The device does not include a 120Hz high refresh rate ProMotion display, which was an expected feature for a "Pro" display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Reverse Wireless Charging**: There is no reverse wireless charging capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **USB-C**: The phone does not feature a USB Type-C port for charging and data transfer, which would have been considered a "pro" addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Apple Pencil Support**: Support for the Apple Pencil is not available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **In-Display Fingerprint Reader**: An in-display fingerprint reader was not implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Dedicated "Pro" Software Features**: Unlike the iPad Pro, which received specific [[software_and_features_in_iphone_11_pro | iPadOS]] features, the [[software_and_features_in_iphone_11_pro | iPhone 11 Pro]] lacks any special software bits to make it feel more "Pro" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. A basic expectation, like camera settings being integrated directly into the camera app rather than buried in the Settings app, was also not met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

The reviewer suggests that the "Pro" name might have been added simply because it's a popular trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## Actual "Pro" Enhancements

Despite the unfulfilled expectations, the [[iphone_11_pro_design_and_build | iPhone 11 Pro]] introduces several significant improvements over its predecessors:

### [[iphone_11_pro_design_and_build | Design and Build]]
The overall [[iphone_11_pro_design_and_build | design]] is nearly identical to the iPhone Xs and Xs Max <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. A key new feature is the frosted matte finish on the back glass, which provides a slight texture and is highly praised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. In contrast, the camera square retains a glossy finish, which is the opposite of the cheaper [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 11]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Available colors include matte Space Gray, Midnight Green (a subtle, dark, almost military camo-like green), silver, and gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The matte finish might scratch more easily, though long-term testing is needed to confirm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### [[design_and_display_of_iphone_11_pro | Display]]
The [[design_and_display_of_iphone_11_pro | display]], now called "Super Retina XDR," is an improvement over the iPhone Xs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. It boasts a peak brightness of 1200 nits and a 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. It maintains the same resolution and OLED technology, making it more impressive for media consumption and photo/video editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. 3D Touch has been removed and replaced with haptic long presses, performing similar functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### [[iphone_11_pro_battery_and_performance | Battery and Performance]]
Apple claims a significant improvement in [[iphone_11_pro_battery_and_performance | battery life]]: the [[iphone_11_pro_design_and_build | iPhone 11 Pro]] offers 4 hours more than the iPhone Xs, and the [[iphone_11_pro_design_and_build | iPhone 11 Pro Max]] offers 5 hours more than the Xs Max <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This improvement largely stems from the increased efficiency of the A13 Bionic chip, which is also more powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The [[iphone_11_pro_design_and_build | iPhone 11 Pro]] finally includes an 18W fast charger in the box, utilizing a USB Type-C to Lightning cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Cameras
The most significant upgrade is the new triple camera system on the back, comprising a normal camera, a 2x telephoto lens, and a 120-degree ultra-wide lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Users can smoothly switch between these lenses using buttons or a slider in the camera app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. A major focus was on matching the quality across all three cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. All three cameras support 4K 60fps video recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Portrait mode can now be used with either the telephoto or the standard primary camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Overall, improvements are expected in image and video quality due to computational photography, high dynamic range, and image pipeline enhancements, making it a "pro level photo and video camera" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Other Improvements
Minor enhancements include better Face ID, slightly improved water resistance, and more shatter-resistant glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## Conclusion

While the [[iphone_11_pro_design_and_build | iPhone 11 Pro]] is expected to be one of the best-performing phones of the year, potentially having some of the best battery life and display, the reviewer feels that the "Pro" designation doesn't quite live up to its name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Apple is primarily banking on the enhanced camera system to justify the "Pro" title, aiming for it to be the best camera in any smartphone for videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. For photos, its superiority is debatable with upcoming competition like the Pixel 4 and Huawei's new flagships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Overall, the [[comparison_of_iphone_11_pro_to_previous_models | iPhone 11 Pro]] upgrade is heavily focused on the cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

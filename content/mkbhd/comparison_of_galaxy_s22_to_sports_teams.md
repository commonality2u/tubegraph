The Samsung Galaxy S22 series, the early 2000s San Antonio Spurs, and the current day Phoenix Suns share common traits: they are drama-free, somewhat boring, and yet quietly very good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

### The San Antonio Spurs and Phoenix Suns Analogy
The early 2000s San Antonio Spurs were not a "one-trick pony" focused on athleticism, dunking, or three-pointers, which casual fans might immediately appreciate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Instead, they exemplified solid fundamentals, ball movement, high-percentage shots, and shared responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Similarly, the modern-day Phoenix Suns do not have one huge standout MVP Superstar, but the entire team is exceptionally good with no real weaknesses, making them the number one team in basketball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

The Galaxy S22 series embodies this "boring" excellence, being so good across the board that it presents no significant weaknesses, as Samsung avoided huge risks and simply improved upon an already good foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### General Performance and Features
The [[design_and_physical_features_of_galaxy_s22 | design and physical features of the Galaxy S22]] are very similar to the previous year's model, though slightly smaller and more squared off, now featuring glass on the back instead of plastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. While the spot where a finger rests under the camera bump can feel a bit sharp without a case, users quickly adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Users can expect an IP68 water-resistant phone with solid speakers, clicky buttons, the best ultrasonic fingerprint reader, and a nice satin finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. The "in-hand feel" of the smaller Galaxy S22 is particularly notable, with Samsung making both the S22 and S22 Plus smaller than their predecessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The S22 Plus shrunk from 6.7 inches to 6.6 inches, and the smaller S22 went from 6.2 inches to 6.1 inches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. With flat sides, tiny symmetrical bezels, and a corner-to-corner display, the S22 has a surprisingly compact feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, making it a contender for "compact phone of the year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Display and Battery
Regarding [[display_technology_and_specifications_of_galaxy_s22 | display technology and specifications of Galaxy S22]], both the S22 and S22 Plus feature flat 1080p 120Hz adaptive AMOLED panels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. The Plus model is larger and boasts a higher peak brightness of 1750 nits, while the S22 achieves a respectable 1300 nits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Both are highly viewable outdoors, with the larger phones and the [[samsung_galaxy_s24_ultra_features | Ultra]] being exceptionally bright, even in direct sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. There was initial confusion about whether these were LTPO displays, which can modulate refresh rates down to 10Hz to save battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Samsung clarified that while data transfer rates to the display can go as low as 10Hz, the actual refresh rate ranges from 48Hz to 120Hz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This means it lacks the full variable refresh rate range of LTPO2 found on the [[samsung_galaxy_s24_ultra_features | Ultra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Despite this, it remains a great, bright, and responsive display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Some apps, like Waze, Google Maps, and the Galaxy Store, still default to 60Hz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

Regarding [[battery_life_and_performance_of_galaxy_s22 | battery life and performance of Galaxy S22]], concerns arose due to both phones having 300mAh smaller batteries than last year's models and the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip running hot despite its efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This chip, while efficient on a 4nm process node for standby, can be quickly depleted with heavy use like high-brightness navigation and gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. However, battery life turned out to be "fine," or "San Antonio Spurs boring level good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The S22 Plus generally provides a day and a half of use, while the smaller S22 can end a normal day with 10-20% battery remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. The S22 Plus also offers a better overall battery experience due to its support for 45-watt fast charging, compared to the S22's 25 watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. (Note: The 45W charger is sold separately for an additional $50) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

A subtle but noticeable downgrade was the vibration motor, switching from a z-axis to an x-axis motor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. While haptics are still strong and responsive, the change in direction makes vibrations less pronounced in a pocket or on a table, leading to missed notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

### Camera Capabilities
The potential camera upgrade on the S22 series was initially likened to the 2016 Golden State Warriors signing [[kevin_durant_brooklyn_nets | Kevin Durant]], suggesting a clear number one favorite status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. The S22 features a new 50-megapixel main camera, a 10-megapixel 110-degree ultrawide, and another 10-megapixel 3x telephoto camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. However, this new camera system is more akin to Harrison Barnes than [[kevin_durant_brooklyn_nets | Kevin Durant]], meaning it's very good but not mind-blowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

Samsung's cameras handle most normal lighting situations well, with nicely balanced colors and processing that avoids being overly sharp or saturated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. The ultrawide is softer than the main camera but performs well in good light, and the telephoto is "rock solid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. There are no weird HDR haloing issues, white balance inconsistencies, or autofocus problems, with minimal shutter lag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. It's described as "boring Tim Duncan with the bank shot level solid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

Significant [[camera_capabilities_and_improvements_in_galaxy_s22 | camera capabilities and improvements in Galaxy S22]] include:
*   **8K Video**: It no longer punches into a 3x crop when shooting 8K video, instead using a smaller crop on the main sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. This crop is even smaller than on the [[samsung_galaxy_s24_ultra_features | Ultra]], which crops into the middle 33 megapixels of its 108-megapixel sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. However, 8K video is still limited to 24 FPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>, despite the last three Snapdragon chips supporting 8K 30 FPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
*   **Software Enhancements**: "Nightography" for better detail in night shots, AI stereo portrait mode improvements for better cutouts, Space Zoom stability locking, and Auto Framing that tracks up to 10 faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. There's also a new separate Expert RAW app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

### Software Experience
The Galaxy S22 series has solidified itself as the "default Android phone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, especially in contrast to issues with other Android phones. Samsung's One UI has evolved from being clunky and bloated into one of the most stable, performant, and feature-packed Android experiences available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Samsung integrates Google features like the Google page next to the home screen and the Material U wallpaper picker from Android 12, while also adding its own extensive features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

Samsung is even surpassing Google in some aspects:
*   **Google Messages**: Samsung phones now feature a Samsung-skinned version of Google Messages as the default, incorporating the half-screen reachable UI that matches One UI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.
*   **Google Duo Feature**: A new Google Duo feature, allowing users to watch YouTube videos together during a video call (similar to Apple's SharePlay), launched exclusively on Galaxy S22 and [[samsung_galaxy_s24_ultra_features | S22 Ultra]] phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. There's no timeline for its release on other Android phones, including Google's own Pixel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
*   **Software Updates**: Samsung promises four years of software updates for the Galaxy S22 series, which is more than the three years Google promises for its Pixel phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

### Conclusion
The Galaxy S22 series is "boring" because it has virtually no glaring flaws, making it incredibly easy to recommend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. While there are desires for greater sustainability, such as including a charger in the box to reduce waste, and despite plastics made from recycled fishing nets making only a tiny dent in Samsung's overall footprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>, the S22 series has earned its spot alongside the iPhone 13 as a primary recommendation for anyone in the market for a flagship phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

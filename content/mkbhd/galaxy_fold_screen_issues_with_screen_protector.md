Several [[Galaxy Fold screen issues with screen protector | Galaxy Fold]] review units experienced screen failures, some directly linked to the removal of what appeared to be a screen protector [00:00:25]. The issues began to "unfold" simultaneously across various reviewers [00:00:21].

## The Reviewer's Experience

The reviewer, MKBHD, encountered a screen issue with his [[Galaxy Fold screen issues with screen protector | Galaxy Fold]] on the third day after unboxing, while shooting his video [00:00:41]. He noticed a thin lip around the inside screen, similar to typical pre-installed screen protectors found on other Samsung devices, such as the [[Samsung Galaxy S10 | Galaxy S10]] [01:01:03]. As a routine, he attempted to peel this film off, expecting it to be a removable screen protector [01:01:28].

Upon starting to peel, he observed it was more strongly glued than a normal screen protector [01:01:41]. Within seconds of peeling an area the size of a dime, the entire screen went black, followed by a stripe and flickering in the top left corner [01:01:47]. This incident broke the device [02:00:00]. Samsung was understanding and replaced the phone [02:01:17].

## Widespread Failures Among Reviewers

Shortly after the reviewer's incident, multiple other reviewers reported similar screen failures with their [[Galaxy Fold screen issues with screen protector | Galaxy Fold]] units [02:03:00]. Of the four [[different_scenarios_leading_to_galaxy_fold_screen_failures | Galaxy Fold units that broke]], some were directly due to the protective layer:

*   **Mark Gurman (Bloomberg)**: Tweeted that he thought the layer was a protective film and peeled the entire thing off, which quickly led to the death of the screen. His screen slowly went from half black to two-thirds black to completely busted over 12 hours [03:03:38].
*   **MKBHD**: Broke his screen within seconds of peeling off what he thought was a screen protector [03:03:55].

Two other reported failures, from Dieter Bohn (The Verge) and Steve Kovach, were not attributed to peeling the film but rather to internal bulges or damage during regular use [03:07:07].

## The "Protective Layer" vs. "Screen Protector"

It became evident that the film was not a typical removable screen protector [02:01:12]. [[Samsungs response to Galaxy Fold issues | Samsung]] later clarified that the main screen includes a "special protective layer" which is "part of the display structure" [04:03:58]. Peeling this protective layer or using any adhesives on the main screen may cause damage [04:03:58].

However, initial review units did not include a warning about this protective layer on their packaging [04:05:58]. A warning stating "The main screen includes a special protective layer. Peeling that protective layer or using any adhesives on the main screen such as a screen protector or stickers may cause damage" was only seen on plastic wrappers for carrier-related units (like from T-Mobile) and was a late addition [04:03:08]. This suggests Samsung realized the need for a warning between providing review units and shipping to carrier stores [05:02:22].

## Implications and Warnings

Even if not intentionally peeled, a film with a lip can eventually collect dust and may start to peel on its own [05:03:35]. Reviewer Joanna Stern, who resisted peeling the film, noted her unit had already started to peel [05:04:45].

The core issue is that folding phones require a plastic display instead of glass, making them more delicate and prone to damage, even from what seems like a simple screen protector removal [06:03:37]. This situation has significant [[implications_of_galaxy_fold_failures_for_foldable_phones | implications for foldable phones]] in general, raising skepticism about their durability [06:04:48].

[[Samsungs response to Galaxy Fold problems | Samsung]] stated they would thoroughly inspect the problematic units to determine the cause of the matter and would ensure this critical information about the protective layer is clearly delivered to customers [06:00:00].

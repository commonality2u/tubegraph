[[new_features_in_ios_17s_messages_and_widgets | iOS 17]] introduces significant improvements to Airdrop, aiming to make it more capable and user-friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. While Airdrop can sometimes be glitchy, it is hoped that stability improvements are also part of this update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Many of the new features in [[new_features_in_ios_17s_messages_and_widgets | iOS 17]], including Airdrop enhancements, rely on having another iPhone user nearby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Key Enhancements

### NameDrop for Contact Sharing
One of the most notable new features is "NameDrop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This allows users to share contact information by simply holding two iPhones close to each other, typically an inch or two apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. An animation plays as the phones communicate and transfer a custom contact poster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

Users can choose exactly which information to share, such as:
*   Phone number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>
*   Email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>
*   Even a fake number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>

This shared information comes from the "My Card" section in contact settings, which can be customized with a photo and fonts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Any changes made to your contact poster will automatically update for people who have you in their contacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### Expanded "Bump" Functionality
Beyond contact sharing, the "bump" gesture can now be used for other types of content:
*   Sharing photos or videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
*   Sharing content links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>
*   Starting a SharePlay session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>

This functionality makes it easier to find a specific iPhone for Airdrop by bringing it within NFC distance of another iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Cellular Transfer Continuation
Previously, Airdrop used a Wi-Fi Direct connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. In [[new_features_in_ios_17s_messages_and_widgets | iOS 17]], if an Airdrop file transfer is not complete and the two iPhones move out of range from each other, the transfer will seamlessly resume over cellular data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This means users can walk away without interrupting large file transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### Historical Context
The "bump to share" concept is not entirely new. An app called "Bump," released around 2009, offered similar functionality for sharing contact information by bumping phones together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Google later acquired this app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

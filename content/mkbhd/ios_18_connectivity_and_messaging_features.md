Apple's iOS 18, released in mid-2024, introduces several new features focused on improving connectivity and messaging for iPhone users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The developer beta was available for testing in the weeks leading up to the public beta release, with a general release expected in September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Unlike previous versions, many of these new features are integrated directly into the iPhone rather than relying heavily on the broader Apple ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Control Center Enhancements
The [[New Features in iOS 17s Messages and Widgets | Control Center]] in iOS 18 has been redesigned, featuring a more colorful interface and a new three-page layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
The pages are structured as follows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>:
*   **First Page** Contains core controls.
*   **Second Page** A full-page visualizer for media playback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Third Page** A list of one-touch toggles for basic connectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This full-page list is an expanded version of what is available on the first page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

Users can customize the size and placement of controls on the first page by tapping the plus button in the corner, which reveals a grid for arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Controls have predefined sizes that they can morph between <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. A wide range of new controls can be added to surface frequently used functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

Currently, most available controls are for Apple applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. However, Apple has announced that third-party apps will be able to integrate their own controls into the Control Center, potentially allowing for one-touch actions like turning on car AC or opening a barcode scanner in an app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Other notable Control Center additions include:
*   **Flashlight Control** Users can now control both the intensity and beam width of the flashlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. While intensity adjustments work, the beam width function's effectiveness is less clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Power Off Button** A new button has been added to turn off the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Lock Screen Customization** Users can now change the default lock screen controls (flashlight and camera) by holding down on the lock screen, selecting "customize," and then "lock screen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This feature is also anticipated to support third-party app controls in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## RCS Support
[[New Features in iOS 17s Messages and Widgets | RCS support]] is now live on iPhone in iOS 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. While texts from Android devices will still appear as green bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, users can now send high-quality media between modern Android phones and iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. For example, a 3MB image sent from an iPhone to an Android device will be received at full quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Additionally, typing indicators and read receipts are now supported, and reactions appear to be working well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Although not fully integrated into the blue bubble iMessage experience, Apple can now confirm the implementation of RCS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

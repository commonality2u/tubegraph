From: [[mkbhd]] <br/> 
The [[Apple Watch Ultra]] is designed for a specific segment of users beyond those served by the standard Apple Watch models, offering premium features and specifications that are often considered overkill for most individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Apple's "Pro" Philosophy

Apple typically uses the "Pro" designation for the highest-end versions of its products, such as iPhone Pro, MacBook Pro, AirPods Pro, iPad Pro, and Pro Display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. These devices include features that a smaller fraction of the population can fully utilize, catering to "pro" or "hardcore" users, enthusiasts, or even "wannabe pros" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The [[Apple Watch Ultra]] follows this philosophy, even though it was not named "Watch Pro" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Targeting the "Outskirts"

While the [[comparing_apple_watch_ultra_to_other_apple_watches | Apple Watch SE]] satisfies the needs of most of the population, and the standard [[comparing_apple_watch_ultra_to_other_apple_watches | Apple Watch Series 8]] (with its always-on display and different sizes) covers an even larger group, Apple developed the [[Apple Watch Ultra]] for individuals for whom the regular Apple Watch was insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The goal is to bring these users, who might have previously opted out of the Apple ecosystem, into it by addressing their specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

### Specific User Profiles

The [[Apple Watch Ultra Features for Adventurers and Athletes | Apple Watch Ultra is attractive to the most extreme users]] and adventurers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Its enhanced [[apple_watch_ultra_design_and_build | ruggedness]], [[apple_watch_ultra_features_for_adventurers_and_athletes | features]], and [[apple_watch_ultra_battery_life | battery life]] are key improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

1.  **Scuba Divers**:
    *   Targets frequent scuba divers who previously relied on dedicated dive computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

    *   A partnership with a third-party company for the Oceanic+ app (coming later) aims to provide nearly all professional dive computer functionalities, including air integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. It does not support tank pressure monitoring or depth past 40 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

2.  **Adventurous Hikers**:
    *   Aimed at those who go off-path for miles, sometimes for days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

    *   The Wayfinder watch face provides quick access to navigation tools, including a live compass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

3.  **Ultra Endurance Athletes**:
    *   Designed for athletes whose activities, like Ironman races, ultra marathons, and Spartan races, exceed the battery life of standard Apple Watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
    *   Key benefits include dual-frequency GPS and the Action Button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
    *   The significantly improved [[apple_watch_ultra_battery_life | battery life]], approximately double that of the standard Apple Watch, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
    *   A future battery optimization setting for workouts will ping GPS and heart rate less often, potentially tripling battery life to up to 60 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

### Benefits for General Users

Even for those who don't engage in extreme activities, the [[Apple Watch Ultra]] offers advantages:
*   **Extended [[apple_watch_ultra_battery_life | Battery Life]]**: The speaker, a tech reviewer and ultimate frisbee player, notes that the [[Apple Watch Ultra]]'s battery only drains 20% during a practice compared to 40% on his [[Apple Watch Series 7 features | Apple Watch Series 7]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

While the [[Apple Watch Ultra]] is technically the best Apple Watch ever made, its specialized features and size might make it overkill for many, similar to the [[ROG Phone]] being an extreme gaming device that also improves general use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. It can replace extreme specific devices like dive computers or GPS watches but remains an Apple Watch designed for daily wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. Its distinctive appearance, however, may make it harder to "dress down" compared to a regular Apple Watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.

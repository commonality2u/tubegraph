The [[iPhone 11 Pro design and build | iPhone 11 Pro]] and [[iPhone 11 Pro design and build | iPhone 11 Pro Max]] are Apple's flagship iPhones, starting at $999 and $1099 respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Key aspects of these new phones include improvements in the display, battery, cameras, and a new matte finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Battery Life

The [[battery_life_improvements_in_iphone_11_pro | iPhone 11 Pro]] boasts significant battery improvements over its predecessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Apple claimed 4 hours more battery life than the [[comparison_of_iphone_11_pro_to_previous_models | iPhone 10s]] and 5 hours more than the [[comparison_of_iphone_11_pro_to_previous_models | iPhone 10s Max]] for the [[battery_enhancements_in_iphone_13_pro | 11 Pro Max]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This major improvement is attributed to a physically larger battery compared to the previous model, but primarily to the enhanced efficiency of the A13 Bionic chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The A13 Bionic chip is not only more powerful but also significantly more efficient, which contributes to the battery gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. The [[battery_enhancements_in_iphone_13_pro | iPhone 11 Pro]] is expected to have one of the best battery lives among phones released in its year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

## Performance Enhancements

The A13 Bionic chip inside the [[iPhone 11 Pro design and build | iPhone 11 Pro]] models is described as a much more powerful and efficient chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Overall, the [[iPhone 11 Pro design and build | iPhone 11 Pro]] is anticipated to be one of the best performing phones of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

Other performance-related improvements and observations include:
*   **Display:** The new "Super Retina XDR" display is brighter, reaching a peak brightness of 1200 nits and offering a 2 million to 1 contrast ratio, making it more impressive for media consumption and editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. However, it does not feature a 120 Hertz high refresh rate "ProMotion" display, which some users might have expected for a "Pro" phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **3D Touch:** The 3D Touch feature has been removed, replaced by "haptic presses" (long presses) that perform similar functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Additional Improvements:** The phone features improved Face ID, slightly enhanced water resistance, and more shatter-resistant glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

Despite the "Pro" moniker, some expected "pro" features like reverse wireless charging, a high refresh rate "ProMotion" display, USB-C port, Apple Pencil support, or an in-display fingerprint reader were not included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Furthermore, there are no special software features exclusive to the Pro version to enhance its "Pro" feel, unlike [[software_and_features_in_iphone_11_pro | iPadOS]] on the iPad Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## Charging

The [[iPhone 11 Pro design and build | iPhone 11 Pro]] finally includes an 18-watt fast charger in the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This fast charger utilizes a USB Type-C to Lightning cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. The less expensive [[iPhone 11 design and features | iPhone 11]] does not come with this fast charger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

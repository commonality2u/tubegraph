A visit to the secret labs of the Walt Disney Company, known as the Disney Imagineering Labs, revealed the surprising amount of technology involved in designing and engineering attractions, theme parks, and rides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Much of this technology is still experimental and unreleased to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The labs, located in various buildings across a California neighborhood, showcase the cutting edge of [[innovations_in_theme_park_technology | theme park technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Animatronic Robots and Droids

The labs are home to realistic [[animatronic_robots_and_droids_at_disney | animatronic robots]] designed for attractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Visitors are greeted by [[animatronic_robots_and_droids_at_disney | droids]] similar to those roaming the theme parks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. These droids share striking similarities with the Boston Dynamics Spot robot, capable of navigating any terrain with an adaptive gait and following instructions from an easy-to-learn custom controller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The [[animatronic_robots_and_droids_at_disney | theme park droids]] adapt to any terrain, walk around, and follow instructions from a customized Steam Deck controller that takes about 60 seconds to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. They can navigate relentlessly all day, interacting with guests and providing entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The technology within them blends animations for walking, standing, and looking around seamlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## The HoloTile

A key experimental technology at the labs is the HoloTile, a unique, one-of-a-kind 360-degree treadmill or "moving floor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This experimental device holds significant potential for future applications, particularly in [[virtual_reality_applications_at_disney | VR]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### How the HoloTile Works

The HoloTile consists of a large number of tiny, one-inch discs that spin on top of their bases like miniature treadmills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. These discs turn to match the direction of movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Unlike a normal, single-direction treadmill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, the HoloTile features articulating cones built into the floor with tilted discs on top, each containing a motor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Only the edge of the tilted disc touches the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, making it feel more like small rotating blades underfoot rather than a flat treadmill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

When a user walks forward, the discs spin clockwise to return their foot to the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. When walking backward, they spin counter-clockwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This mechanism ensures that regardless of direction, speed, or stride, the user is always pulled back to the middle of the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Control Methods and Initial Experiences

The HoloTile can be controlled in three ways: by walking on it, using a PlayStation 5 controller, or with hand gestures (akin to "using the force") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

1.  **Hand Gestures**: By moving a hand in front of a sensor line, objects placed on the HoloTile can be moved, with the floor adjusting to match the hand's motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. This method evokes a Star Wars-like experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
2.  **PlayStation Controller (Seated)**: Users can sit in a chair on a flat piece of wood placed on the HoloTile and use a PlayStation controller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. The left joystick controls position, and the right joystick controls rotation, allowing free movement and spinning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. The floor moves rapidly, and users can steer themselves off the edge if not careful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
3.  **Walking**: To get accustomed to walking on the HoloTile, a training mode at a fraction of the normal speed is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Initially, the tiles wiggle slowly, gradually increasing responsiveness over a two-minute process until they reach 100% real-time speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

### Observations and Challenges

*   **Noise**: The HoloTile is notably loud, an aspect that would need improvement for potential theme park or home use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Movement Path**: Users do not walk in a perfectly straight line; movement often involves gliding over ridges, which can be disorienting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. A future version might feature more numerous and smaller, yet powerful, discs to create a smoother experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

### The Inventor: Lanny Smoot

Lanny Smoot, the inventor of the HoloTile, has been at Disney for over 20 years and holds more than 70 patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. His inventions include the mechanism for the BB8 droid's movement in the park and real-life lightsabers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Smoot demonstrates incredible proficiency on the HoloTile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

### Multiplayer and VR Integration

The HoloTile can accommodate two people simultaneously, as demonstrated by a multiplayer racing game where participants controlled a BB8 droid by jogging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. While the current size is small, a larger surface would enhance this experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

The most compelling application is using the HoloTile with a [[virtual_reality_applications_at_disney | VR headset]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. While other [[virtual_reality_applications_at_disney | inventions used for VR]] exist, a common challenge is motion sickness due to the disagreement between visual input and physical sensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. For instance, in a moving car, eyes see stillness while the body feels motion, leading to sickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. The same applies to the [[virtual_reality_applications_at_disney | HoloTile in VR]]: the eyes perceive movement down a hallway, but the brain, feeling no forward motion, experiences confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

When using an Apple Vision Pro on the HoloTile in a 3D constructed environment (like a Star Trek holo deck), the experience is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. The eyes see movement, legs try to walk forward, and feet slide, but the brain struggles to reconcile the lack of actual forward motion, leading to confusion and baby steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Lanny Smoot, however, navigates confidently through the [[virtual_reality_applications_at_disney | virtual world]] with a headset on, exploring what appears to be a [[virtual_reality_applications_at_disney | virtual Disney theme park]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. This freeform exploration of a huge space, potentially from home, represents a significant step towards the future of [[virtual_reality_applications_at_disney | virtual reality applications at Disney]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The HoloTile represents a significant technological advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Its continued development could bring the reality of seamless virtual exploration closer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

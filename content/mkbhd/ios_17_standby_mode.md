[[iOS 17 Standby Mode]] is a new feature introduced in iOS 17, launching in September with the new iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. It is considered one of the most impressive new additions to the iPhone operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## Activation and Display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>
[[iOS 17 Standby Mode]] transforms the iPhone into a smart home display when two conditions are met:
*   **Charging** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>
*   **Horizontal Orientation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>

When activated, Standby Mode displays a clock along with customizable [[new_features_in_ios_17s_messages_and_widgets | widgets]] or photos in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This feature allows the iPhone to display information ambiently, making it convenient for use on a nightstand or in a kitchen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## Interface and Customization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>
The interface of [[iOS 17 Standby Mode]] is reminiscent of the Apple Watch, featuring:
*   **Preset Layouts** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>
*   **Swipe Navigation** Users can swipe horizontally to switch between three different faces and vertically to cycle through various styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Many of these styles closely resemble Apple Watch faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

## Enhanced Siri Integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>
A significant improvement contributing to the smart home display feel is the enhancement of Siri <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>:
*   **Conversational Siri** Users no longer need to repeatedly press a button or reactivate Siri to ask follow-up questions; it maintains a continuous listening state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   **Simplified Activation** The "Hey Siri" trigger phrase is no longer required; users can simply say "Siri" to activate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> While a significant update, many of the new features in iOS 17, including elements of Standby Mode's utility, are designed to work best within the Apple ecosystem, often requiring interaction with another iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

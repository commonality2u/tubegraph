From: [[mkbhd]] <br/> 

The front glass of the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 is confirmed to feature a sheet of sapphire crystal, rather than just [[gorilla_glass|Gorilla Glass]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. This debunks earlier speculation that only a larger 5.5-inch iPhone model would incorporate a sapphire display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.

Sapphire crystal offers several advantages over [[gorilla_glass|Gorilla Glass]], which was used on the iPhone 5S <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. The two primary benefits are its extremely high [[quality_and_clarity_of_sapphire_glass|quality]] and significant [[durability_tests_on_sapphire_crystal|durability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

## Properties of Sapphire Crystal

### [[quality_and_clarity_of_sapphire_glass | Quality and Clarity]]
The sapphire crystal is described as paper-thin, with a thickness similar to a sheet of paper, and is perfectly see-through with 0% opacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. When looking through the sapphire glass, there is minimal distortion, colors remain exact, and no color shift is observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. Its [[quality_and_clarity_of_sapphire_glass|clarity]] is considered comparable to the glass used in recording equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

### [[durability_tests_on_sapphire_crystal | Durability]]
The sapphire crystal panel exhibits notable flexibility, showing tolerance for a small amount of bending, torque, and give <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

Specific [[durability_tests_on_sapphire_crystal|durability tests]] included:
*   **Scratch Tests**
    *   Applying deep pressure with a knife yielded no scratches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
    *   Pressing and dragging keys across the panel with significant force also resulted in no marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
    *   Stabbing the center of the panel with the point of a knife and dragging it around with serious pressure caused no damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.
    *   It is considered "almost impossible to scratch this screen with any regular use" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.
*   **Bend Test**
    *   Attempting to bend the panel with significant force revealed it was "absolutely no way I can break this display under my own power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
    *   The worst blemishes observed were fingerprints and dust from handling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

While scratch and bend tests were performed, drop tests or corner impact tests could not be conducted as the panel was not attached to a phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.

## Existing Apple Implementations
Apple already uses sapphire crystal in the iPhone 5S for its camera lens and home button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. This is because the camera lens requires a super high-quality, durable, and crystal-clear material for optimal photography, and the home button needs to be crystal clear to accurately read fingerprints through the glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. The iPhone 6's home button part, including the Touch ID sensor, is confirmed to be the same size as the iPhone 5S <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

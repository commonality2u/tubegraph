The cameras are a primary focus for the [[iPhone 11 Pro camera capabilities | iPhone 11 Pro]] in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This model introduces a triple-camera system, a significant upgrade over previous models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## Camera Specifications and General Performance

The [[iPhone 11 Pro camera capabilities | iPhone 11 Pro]] features three new sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>:
*   **Primary Sensor**: A 12-megapixel sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Telephoto Camera**: A 2x telephoto camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   **Ultrawide Camera**: A 0.5x ultrawide camera, offering approximately a 120-degree field of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

The [[iPhone 11 camera improvements | iPhone 11]]'s cameras show a significant improvement over the [[comparison_of_iphone_11_pro_to_previous_models | iPhone Xs]] in broad daylight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. They are noted for often taking the sharpest and cleanest photos from a smartphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Colors are realistic, dynamic range is excellent, and tonal mapping for subjects is next-level, aiding in challenging shooting scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. The typical photo from the [[iPhone 11 Pro camera capabilities | iPhone 11 Pro]] is considered the closest representation of what the human eye sees among smartphone cameras, including the Pixel, which tends to be more contrasty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

## Ultrawide Camera

The [[iPhone 11 Pro camera capabilities | iPhone 11 Pro]] finally includes an ultrawide camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. While LG, Samsung, Motorola, Asus, Oneplus, and Huawei had already implemented ultrawide lenses, Apple's version offers good fun perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. A main advantage is its consistency with the other lenses in terms of color and white balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. However, due to a smaller sensor and slower glass, its quality and detail are noticeably a step down from the main camera, resulting in softer images with more noise reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## Camera User Interface (UI) Improvements

The camera app UI in the [[iPhone 11 Pro camera capabilities | iPhone 11 Pro]] has been improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>:
*   **Simplified Controls**: Controls have been simplified and moved to the bottom for easier one-handed reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Ultrawide Preview**: When opening the app, a preview of what would be seen with the ultrawide camera is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This preview can be distracting and may lag or not be perfectly aligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. It automatically fades out for close-up subjects, but there is no option to completely disable it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Night Mode

The [[iPhone 11 Pro camera capabilities | iPhone 11 Pro]] finally includes a dedicated Night Mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. It turns on automatically when dark enough, but there's no manual option to activate it, which is considered a drawback for a "Pro" phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **UI for Night Mode**: When active, the UI is excellent, providing exposure equivalence for live adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. It can extend exposure times significantly when a tripod or stabilization is detected, and the picture visibly brightens in real-time during capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Performance**: Shots taken at night and in low light are very good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
*   **Comparison to Pixel's Night Sight**:
    *   Pixel's Night Sight tends to brighten photos more, lifting shadows and highlights, making it more of a "nighttime to daytime transformation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
    *   [[iPhone 11 Pro camera capabilities | iPhone 11 Pro]]'s Night Mode is more true to life and produces the most detailed, sharpest low-light photos of any smartphone, even more so than the Pixel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
*   **Limitations**: Night Mode doesn't always activate in dim light, and it is not available on the ultrawide camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Despite these, it's a strong start and expected to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

## Video Capabilities

The [[iPhone 11 Pro camera capabilities | iPhone 11 Pro]] continues to offer the best video quality among smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. The UI also makes it easier to quickly start recording video: holding down the shutter button immediately begins recording, similar to Instagram or Snapchat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Users can lock into video recording by dragging the button to the right for hands-free operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

## Conclusion on Cameras

The increased focus on smartphone cameras across the industry means constant competition to deliver the best possible camera in a pocket-friendly device, benefiting consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. The [[iPhone 11 Pro camera capabilities | iPhone 11 Pro]]'s new cameras are a core focus, making it a highly appealing option for those who prioritize the best possible camera in their phone, especially for video creation or professional content creation on a mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

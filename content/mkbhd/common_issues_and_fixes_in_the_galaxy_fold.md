The [[Samsung Galaxy Fold features and design | Samsung Galaxy Fold]] was initially announced in February and began its press cycle later in the year, with review units distributed for first impressions and unboxings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. However, a small number of these review units, including the one featured, started breaking for various reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This led to a significant recall and an internal re-engineering effort by Samsung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Original Issues with the Galaxy Fold

The initial [[different_scenarios_leading_to_galaxy_fold_screen_failures | screen issues]] and [[galaxy_fold_screen_issues_with_screen_protector | design flaws]] observed in the original Galaxy Fold review units included:

*   **Misleading Protective Layer** A thin layer that was part of the display itself appeared to be a removable screen protector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Some users peeled this off, damaging the display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Hinge Gaps and Debris Ingress** The original design had noticeable gaps at the hinge, particularly at the top and bottom of the display, which allowed dust and debris to get into the hinge mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This oversight was surprising in hindsight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## [[Samsungs response to Galaxy Fold problems | Samsung's Response to Issues]]

Following the widespread reports of breakages, [[samsungs_response_to_galaxy_fold_issues | Samsung recalled]] all review units, taking them back for analysis and repair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Despite initial doubts and speculation that the phone might be canceled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, Samsung chose to address the problems internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. The company did not ship any units to customers until the fixes were implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

Samsung's approach was seen as positive because they accepted what was going wrong and addressed it, rather than attributing issues to user error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This contrasted with what might be perceived as a "stubborn" approach by other companies, such as Apple, where issues might be blamed on how the product is held or used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. The company's decision highlighted the importance of real-world user testing, as lab environments might not account for all potential user behaviors like putting the phone in lint-filled pockets or exposing it to sand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

## [[Samsung Galaxy Fold design changes | Fixes and Updates in the New Galaxy Fold]]

The updated Galaxy Fold incorporates several [[features_of_the_updated_galaxy_fold | key design changes]] to mitigate the original issues:

1.  **Extended Protective Layer**: The thin protective layer, which is an integral part of the display, has been extended all the way to the edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. It is now tucked underneath the display bezel, making it physically impossible to mistake for a removable screen protector and peel it off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
2.  **T-Shaped Caps at Hinge**: New T-shaped caps have been added at the top and bottom of the display, right at the hinge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. These caps are designed to prevent dust or debris from entering the hinge mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. While these additions improve protection, the phone is still not liquid or water-resistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
3.  **Reduced Hinge Gap**: The gap that forms when the phone is closed is now slightly smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Although a crack is still barely visible through the middle, it is less pronounced than before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
4.  **Firmer Hinge Mechanism**: The hinge mechanism itself feels a bit more firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. It has a more distinct "snap" when fully opened to a flat position and when folding it back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## Remaining Characteristics and Outlook

Despite the [[Samsung Galaxy Fold relaunch rumors | re-engineering]], the fixed Galaxy Fold remains a very similar device to its original iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It still features a soft plastic display, necessary for its folding capability, which cannot be achieved with hard glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. A new warning during the setup process advises users to avoid pressing the screen hard, as applying too much pressure, digging fingernails into the plastic, or scratching the protective layer can still damage the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The crease in the display also looks about the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

While the new [[implications_of_galaxy_fold_failures_for_foldable_phones | Galaxy Fold is still a delicate phone]] that might be susceptible to breakage, it represents Samsung's strong belief in the foldable phone form factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. The existence of the Galaxy Fold is seen as a positive step, demonstrating that companies are willing to take significant risks in a market increasingly dominated by iterative phone designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. The hope is for a potential "Samsung Galaxy Fold 2" in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

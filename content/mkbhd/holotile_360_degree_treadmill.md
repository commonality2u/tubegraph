The HoloTile is an experimental, one-of-a-kind 360-degree treadmill or "moving floor" developed by Disney Imagineering Labs. It is currently the only one of its kind and is still in an experimental phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The technology offers potential applications, especially in [[virtual_reality_vr_and_augmented_reality_ar | virtual reality (VR)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## How it Works

The HoloTile is comprised of a vast number of tiny, one-inch discs built into the floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. These discs spin on top of their bases, acting like individual small treadmills that turn to match the direction a person is walking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

Unlike a standard treadmill that only moves in one direction, the HoloTile is designed to be responsive to movement in any direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The system incorporates articulating cones with discs on top, each containing motors to spin the discs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. A key design element is that the discs are tilted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Only the edge of the tilted disc touches the surface or a person's foot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This configuration makes it function more like a collection of small blades rotating underfoot rather than a flat treadmill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

When a user walks forward, the discs spin clockwise to move the foot back to the center after it lands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Conversely, when walking backward, the discs spin counter-clockwise to return the foot to the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This mechanism ensures that no matter the direction, length, or speed of a stride, the system always pulls the user back to the center of the HoloTile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Control Methods

The HoloTile can be controlled in three primary ways:
1.  **Walking on it** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>
2.  **Using a controller** (e.g., a PlayStation 5 controller) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>
3.  **Using hand gestures**, akin to "the Force" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>

### Hand Gesture Control

Demonstrations involved placing an apple box on the HoloTile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. A screen displays real-time inputs and sensor readings from the floor and surrounding area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. When a hand crosses a specific line in front of the HoloTile, the program adjusts the floor's movement to match the object's movement with the hand's motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This control method hints at future "Star Wars experience" applications in theme parks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Controller-Based Movement

Users can also control the HoloTile while seated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. While sitting in a chair placed on a flat piece of wood on the HoloTile, a PlayStation controller can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. The left joystick controls position, while the right joystick controls rotation, allowing for free movement and spinning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. The system allows steering completely off the floor if desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### Walking on the HoloTile

Before full-speed usage, a "training mode" at a fraction of normal speed is used to accustom the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. During training, the tiles slowly increase their responsiveness to movements over approximately two minutes, gradually reaching 100% real-time speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Although there is a learning curve, users can become comfortable walking around without constant thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Real-time data on foot and leg movements is displayed behind the user during operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

#### Observations while Walking
*   **Noise**: The HoloTile is quite loud, an aspect Disney Imagineering will likely address for future applications in theme parks or homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Movement Path**: Users are never truly walking in a perfectly straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. While it can feel close when feet align with rows of discs from the center, other times it involves gliding over ridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Future versions may feature smaller and more numerous discs to improve this, posing an engineering challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

## Inventor and Multi-User Capabilities

The HoloTile was invented by Lanny Smoot, who has been with Disney for over 20 years and holds more than 70 patents, including the technology for the BB8 droid's movement in parks and real-life lightsabers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

The HoloTile is capable of supporting two people simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. An example shown was two users playing a multiplayer racing game, controlling a virtual BB8 by jogging around the course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. While functional, a larger area with more tiles would enhance the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

## HoloTile and Virtual Reality (VR)

The most anticipated application of the HoloTile is with [[virtual_reality_vr_and_augmented_reality_ar | VR]] headsets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. While other 360-degree treadmill inventions exist for [[virtual_reality_vr_and_augmented_reality_ar | VR]], a common challenge is the disagreement between what the eyes see and what the body and brain feel, leading to motion sickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

In [[virtual_reality_vr_and_augmented_reality_ar | VR]], when a user wears a headset and walks on a moving treadmill, their eyes perceive movement through a virtual environment (e.g., a moving hallway), but their brain, registering that they are walking in place, does not feel forward motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This sensory conflict can cause discomfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

When using the HoloTile with an Apple Vision Pro headset in a 3D constructed environment (e.g., a virtual Star Trek holodeck), the experience is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. The eyes see movement, legs try to walk forward, and feet slide, but the brain expects no forward motion, causing confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Despite the difficulty, the inventor, Lanny Smoot, demonstrated confident movement through virtual spaces, such as a virtual Disney theme park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

This technology offers a glimpse into a future where users can freely explore vast virtual spaces from the comfort of their homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Continued development of the HoloTile aims to bring this reality closer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

*   New cameras, including an additional one on the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>
*   A slightly better battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>
*   A new, more efficient A13 Bionic chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>

### Key Considerations for Value
While the [[iPhone 11 design and features|iPhone 11]] offers significant value, potential buyers should consider two main aspects:

1.  **Screen Quality**: The display is still the biggest weakness of this phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. It uses an LCD display with a resolution of 1792 by 828 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Although the YouTube app might misleadingly allow selecting 1080p, the actual resolution is just over 720p <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. If a sharp, high-resolution display is highly valued, or if the screen quality of the [[comparison_between_iphone_11_and_iphone_10r|iPhone 10R]] or [[iPhone 11 design and features|iPhone 11]] in a store is noticeably insufficient, it's recommended to consider higher-resolution OLED iPhones like the iPhone 10S or the [[iPhone 11 Pro design and build|iPhone 11 Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
2.  **Size**: The [[iPhone 11 design and features|iPhone 11]] maintains the same size as the [[comparison_between_iphone_11_and_iphone_10r|iPhone 10R]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. It is a relatively big phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, measuring 8.3 millimeters thick and weighing 194 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
    *   If the 6.1-inch screen size is considered too large, a slightly smaller iPhone with a better display, such as the [[iPhone 11 Pro design and build|iPhone 11 Pro]], could be an option, though it will cost more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
    *   Conversely, if the size is not large enough, the larger [[iPhone 11 Pro design and build|iPhone 11 Pro]] Max is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

### Camera Value
The cameras are a significant new feature for the [[iPhone 11 design and features|iPhone 11]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. It includes a new main camera and an added second ultra-wide camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Both deliver 4K video recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. The [[iPhone 11 design and features|iPhone 11]] also supports portrait mode for animals and objects, not just human faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The wider front-facing camera can take slow-motion selfie videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. While it lacks the telephoto camera of the [[iPhone 11 Pro design and build|iPhone 11 Pro]], the included cameras are described as excellent, A+ smartphone cameras for 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The camera system is considered the best in a $700 smartphone and arguably among the best in any smartphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

The new 10th Generation Baseline iPad (referred to as "this iPad") introduces several updates but also presents a complex pricing and value proposition when compared to other models in Apple's lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Pricing of the 10th Generation iPad and Accessories

The 10th Generation iPad starts at $450 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This represents a significant price increase from its predecessor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

Key accessories for this iPad include:
*   **Magic Keyboard Folio:** This completely redesigned two-piece keyboard and case accessory costs $250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. It features a full function row and modular design, allowing the keyboard to be detached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **First-Generation Apple Pencil:** This iPad supports the first-generation Apple Pencil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Due to the iPad's switch to USB-C, an adapter (USB-C to Lightning) is required to charge the pencil, which costs $9 if lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Comparison with the 9th Generation iPad

The 9th generation iPad remains in Apple's lineup, priced at $329, unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. For users seeking a basic iPad, the 9th generation model is considered a better deal, being over $100 cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This applies to consumers like schools, businesses, or parents who simply need a tablet for basic tasks like watching videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

## Value Proposition Against Higher-End iPads and Laptops

The value proposition of the 10th generation iPad becomes less clear when considering its price with accessories:
*   The baseline storage of the 10th generation iPad is 64 GB, which is not considered "real computer storage" in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   Upgrading to more practical storage (not specified but implied by "real computer storage") and adding the Magic Keyboard Folio brings the total cost to $850 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   At this price point, consumers could instead purchase an [[comparison_of_ipad_pro_with_laptop | iPad Air]], an [[comparison_of_ipad_pro_with_laptop | iPad Pro]], or even a traditional computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. This raises questions about the 10th generation iPad's position in the market, as its price can quickly approach that of more capable devices, particularly when accessories are factored in, impacting its [[pricing_and_value_of_the_iphone_16e | value]] proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

While the 10th generation iPad is a "perfectly good iPad" with modernizations like a new chip (A14 Bionic), USB-C, Wi-Fi 6, and a fine display, its starting price of $450 for the 64GB model alone is seen as "weird" given the available alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

## Feature Discrepancies Affecting Value

*   **Apple Pencil Support:** The 10th generation iPad only supports the first-generation Apple Pencil, requiring an adapter for charging due to its USB-C port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This is despite the existence of the second-generation Apple Pencil, which charges wirelessly via magnets on models like the iPad Air and iPad Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Magic Keyboard Folio Compatibility:** The new two-piece Magic Keyboard Folio is exclusively for this iPad and not available for the new M2 iPad Pro, which some might expect to receive such features, especially functional keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Stage Manager:** The 10th generation iPad does not support Stage Manager, a multitasking feature that would be beneficial for users connecting to external monitors via USB-C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This omission further limits its utility as a "pseudo computer" despite its hardware capabilities.

In conclusion, the 10th generation iPad's pricing and feature set create a somewhat "strange" offering, sitting awkwardly between the more basic and more professional iPad models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

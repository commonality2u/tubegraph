The [[oneplus_6_performance_and_battery_life | OnePlus 6]], released in 2018, is described as a "balanced budget performance beast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Its most important feature is its starting price of $529 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, setting it apart in a market of $700-$1000 flagships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. OnePlus aims to cut price without significantly sacrificing value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, a balance they achieve through specific design and hardware choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Exterior Design and Build

The overall build quality of the [[oneplus_6_performance_and_battery_life | OnePlus 6]] is "legit awesome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, with the phone looking and feeling premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

Key design elements include:
*   **Color Options**
    *   Midnight Black (matte black) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>
    *   Mirror Black (glossier, more prone to fingerprints) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>
    *   Soft White (coming soon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>
*   **Buttons** — The phone features "awesome clicky buttons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Alert Slider** — It includes a "firm and also clicky" alert slider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Initially, its high placement could lead to confusion with the power button, but users adapt over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Shape and Materials** — The [[oneplus_6_performance_and_battery_life | OnePlus 6]] has a "nice wedge shape" and feels "super solid with a lot of metal in there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The frosted glass back reveals a "subtle s shape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Headphone Jack** — The device retains a headphone jack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Dual SIM Card Tray** — It includes a dual SIM card tray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Camera Bump** — There is a slight bump in the back for the camera, which is not considered a significant issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Conscious Omissions

To achieve its price point, OnePlus made "conscious choices" to exclude certain features:

*   **No Expandable Storage** — The phone only offers a dual SIM card tray, with no microSD card expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **Weak Speaker Situation** — It has a single, downward-facing speaker, which is considered the "worst part of the phone's hardware" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The speaker is average at best, can be tinny at high volumes, and lacks a second earpiece speaker for stereo sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. It's also "super easy to block by accident" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Smaller Fingerprint Reader** — The rear-mounted fingerprint reader is "not that bad," but its smaller surface area (no longer a full circle) is "a bit of a bummer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **No Wireless Charging** — Despite having a glass back (which typically enables wireless charging), the [[oneplus_6_performance_and_battery_life | OnePlus 6]] does not support wireless charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. However, this omission is offset by the excellent battery life and fast Dash Charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **No Official IP Water Resistance Rating** — OnePlus claims the phone is "okay if you splash water on it" and "will survive daily use," but it is not officially [[pixel_6_and_pixel_6_pro_design_and_hardware | IP67]] or [[pixel_6_and_pixel_6_pro_design_and_hardware | IP68]] rated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Display

The [[oneplus_6_performance_and_battery_life | OnePlus 6]] features a 6.3-inch 1080p Optic AMOLED display with a resolution of 2280 by 1080 pixels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This resolution is beneficial for battery life and performance, as the GPU doesn't have to push as many pixels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. While not as sharp as Quad HD displays found in phones like the Galaxy S9 or Pixel 2 XL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, it is considered "the best looking 1080p OLED in any phone right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. It gets very bright, is colorful, and offers different display modes for various color profiles and saturation levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### Display Notch
The phone includes a notch at the top of the display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. OnePlus has cleverly handled the notch, allowing users to hide it in display settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. When hidden, the OLED display's black pixels make the notch area seamless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Crucially, the notch almost never cuts into the actual app real estate by default, unlike some earlier notched phones like the Essential Phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. For instance, it doesn't cut off YouTube videos unless the user explicitly enables full-screen mode for that app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

The [[AirPods Pro design and features | new AirPods Pro]] are positioned as high-end headphones, costing $250, and are expected to deliver a significant improvement in audio performance compared to previous models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Initial Impressions
Upon initial testing, the sound quality of the [[apples_new_airpods_and_airpods_pro_features | AirPods Pro]] is described as "fine" overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. They feature new drivers contributing to their sound profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

The experience of sound quality varies depending on the active mode:
*   **With [[noise_cancellation_in_airpods_pro | noise cancellation]] on:** The sound quality is noted to be better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Without [[noise_cancellation_in_airpods_pro | noise cancellation]]:** The sound quality is described as "okay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

The overall early assessment is "not bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### Comparison to Previous AirPods
A significant improvement over previous AirPods models is the enhanced sound quality, addressing a common criticism where older versions "didn't sound great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. The addition of rubber tips, which provide a better seal, is theorized to contribute to improved sound delivery and prevent the earbuds from falling out easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

### Air Pass-Through
The [[airpods_pro_design_and_features | AirPods Pro]] feature larger black grilles on the sides, designed to allow air to pass through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This design aims to prevent the "clogged up" feeling often associated with in-ear seals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. This air pass-through also facilitates the Transparency mode, allowing users to hear sounds around them even with the earbuds in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. The [[noise_cancellation_in_airpods_pro | noise cancellation]] also benefits from this feature by avoiding a "vacuum feeling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Ear Tip Fit Test
To ensure optimal sound and [[noise_cancellation_in_airpods_pro | noise cancellation]] performance, [[apples_new_airpods_and_airpods_pro_features | iOS]] includes an "Ear Tip Fit Test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This feature plays a short sound and uses the AirPods Pro's internal microphones to determine if a good seal has been achieved with the chosen rubber ear tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. If the fit is not optimal, it will advise the user to adjust the rubber tip size for a better seal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. This test is noted for its effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

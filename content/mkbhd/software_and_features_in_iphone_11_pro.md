The [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 11 Pro]] is considered by Apple to be one of their highest-end phones in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Apple focused on four major areas for this new iPhone: design, display, battery life, and cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Design and Build
The design of the [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 11 Pro]] features a new matte finish, which is visually appealing and contributes to the feel of the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The camera square, while initially considered "weird looking," is cut from a single piece of glass, creating an optical illusion where it looks indented despite sticking out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This camera square causes the phone to rock slightly when placed on a table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Apple states the [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 11 Pro]] has "the toughest glass in any smartphone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. However, glass is still glass, and it's recommended to protect the device to prevent shattering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The glass does not appear to scratch as easily as some other matte black glass phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

The front of the phone is nearly identical to previous models, featuring the same screen sizes, resolutions, notch, and bezels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Face ID
[[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro | Face ID]] has been improved to be up to 30% faster in the same space and work at a larger variety of angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. While a slight speed improvement is noticeable, particularly when compared side-by-side with older models, the "variety of angles" improvement is not significant enough to allow unlocking while the phone is flat on a table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Other Physical Features
*   **Buttons**: The buttons are very slightly lower on the phone, potentially making them easier to reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Water Resistance**: The water resistance has been upgraded, maintaining an IP68 certification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Dimensions**: The phone is slightly thicker and heavier, particularly noticeable in the Pro Max model, which is 20 grams heavier than its predecessor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This increased weight contributes to the excellent battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## Display
The [[iphone_11_pro_display_features | iPhone 11 Pro]] display has been slightly upgraded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **3D Touch Removal**: The [[iphone_11_pro_display_features | iPhone 11 Pro]] no longer features 3D Touch, which has been largely replaced by Haptic Touch (long presses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. The removal of 3D Touch hardware created more space inside the phone for a larger battery, contributing significantly to improved battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Brightness and Contrast**: The display can achieve a higher 800 nits of brightness and brief peak brightness of up to 1200 nits in small areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. It also boasts a 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This improved display is branded as the "Super Retina Display XDR" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. While differences might not be immediately apparent in everyday use, the improved brightness is noticeable when watching HDR content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Speakers**: The sound quality is improved thanks to enhanced speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Efficiency**: The display is more efficient, further contributing to battery gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Performance
The [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 11 Pro]] is powered by the new A13 Bionic chip and features 4GB of RAM in the Pro models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. It is extremely fast, as expected from a new phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Improvements over the A12 chip primarily ensure the phone remains fast for a longer period throughout its lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

## Camera Capabilities
The cameras are a major focus for the [[iphone_11_pro_camera_capabilities | iPhone 11 Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. It features a triple camera system:
*   Primary 12-megapixel sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   2x telephoto camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   0.5x ultrawide camera with approximately a 120-degree field of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

### Photo Quality
The [[iphone_11_pro_camera_capabilities | iPhone 11 Pro]] cameras offer a significant improvement over the iPhone 10s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. In daylight, it consistently takes sharpest and cleanest photos, with realistic colors and excellent dynamic range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. The tonal mapping for subjects is "next level," which helps in challenging shooting scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The typical [[iphone_11_pro_camera_capabilities | iPhone 11 Pro]] photo is considered closest to what the human eye perceives among smartphone cameras, even compared to Google Pixel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

### Ultrawide Camera
The addition of an ultrawide camera is a new feature for the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. It offers good consistency in color and white balance with the other lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. However, due to a smaller sensor and slower glass, its quality and detail are noticeably a step down from the main camera, resulting in softer images with more noise reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Despite this, it's considered a valuable addition for new perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

### Camera User Interface (UI)
The camera app UI has been improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Controls have been simplified and moved to the bottom for easier one-handed access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. The UI now provides a preview of what the ultrawide camera would capture, though this can be distracting and cannot be manually turned off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. It automatically fades out for close-up subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

### Night Mode
A dedicated Night Mode is now included, which automatically activates in sufficiently dark conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. There is no manual option to turn it on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. When active, the UI provides exposure equivalence, allowing live adjustments, and can extend exposure times significantly if a tripod or stabilization is detected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. The resulting low-light photos are considered very good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Compared to Pixel's Night Sight, the iPhone's Night Mode produces photos that are more true to life and offer more detailed and sharper low-light images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. However, Night Mode does not activate in dim light, and it is not available for the ultrawide camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

### Video Recording
The [[iphone_11_pro_camera_capabilities | iPhone 11 Pro]] still offers the best video capabilities among smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. The UI has been enhanced for quick video recording; holding down the shutter button immediately starts recording, similar to Instagram or Snapchat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Users can drag the shutter button to the right to lock into video recording mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

## iOS 13
The [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 11 Pro]] ships with iOS 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
*   **New Features**: This version includes features like Dark Mode, long presses, and quick settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.
*   **Bugs**: At release, iOS 13 has been noted to be buggy, with issues such as lock screen controls not appearing, camera app freezes, and other app-specific problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. It is anticipated that future software updates like iOS 13.1 will address these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
*   **General Experience**: Beyond the new Night Mode, the overall software experience, UI, and feature set remain largely unchanged from previous iOS versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

## U1 Chip
The [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 11 Pro]] includes a U1 chip, which is intended to provide ultra-wideband signals for precise location of other U1-enabled devices and to improve Airdrop functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. However, this feature was not enabled in the initial software version (iOS 13) and is expected to be activated in a later update, such as iOS 13.1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. The full capabilities of the U1 chip beyond these initial mentions are not yet known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

## Conclusion on Features
While the [[iphone_11_design_and_features | iPhone 11 Pro]] offers significant upgrades in core functional areas like speed (A13 chip), battery life, and camera, some features expected for a "Pro" phone were not included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. These absent features include a new design, a smaller notch, USB-C, a high refresh rate "ProMotion" display, Touch ID under the display, and reverse wireless charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. The main improvements focus on the A13 chip, battery life, a slightly improved display, and the new cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. The phone is particularly well-suited for those who prioritize the best possible camera in their phone or are professional content creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

The camera on the OnePlus 6 is described as a B-plus in terms of smartphone camera quality, especially when compared to high-end flagships [00:08:57]. However, for its price point, it receives an A-plus rating [00:09:15]. It is noted to be significantly better than other phones in the $500 price range [00:10:18].

## Primary Camera Specifications and Performance
The OnePlus 6 features a 16-megapixel primary camera [00:09:21]. This camera includes optical image stabilization (OIS) and an f/1.7 aperture [00:09:22].

In terms of performance:
*   It takes "pretty nice shots" [00:09:27].
*   Focus is considered fine [00:09:31].
*   Photos generally have plenty of detail and minimal noise [00:09:31].
*   Colors are quite accurate [00:09:34].
*   The camera tends to slightly overexpose rather than underexpose, but dynamic range is sufficient to mitigate this [00:09:37].
*   Every photo is described as "plenty saturated" [00:09:43].
*   Overall, the photos are satisfying, though not "blown away" or "super excited" to use the camera [00:09:45].

## Secondary Camera Details
The second camera on the OnePlus 6 is a 20-megapixel sensor without optical image stabilization (OIS) [00:09:56]. Its primary function appears to be providing depth information for portrait mode [00:09:59]. While decent, it is not considered "great" and the reviewer would not go out of their way to use it extensively [00:10:08].

## Comparisons and Value
The camera quality is positioned below top-tier smartphones like the [[Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro camera capabilities and features | Pixel 2]], [[iPhone X camera quality and features | iPhone X]], and Galaxy S9, which are typically priced much higher [00:09:02].

## Physical Dimensions and Compatibility

The iPhone 6s is physically thicker, taller, and wider than its predecessor, the iPhone 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. Due to these changes, cases and skins designed for the iPhone 6 may not fit the iPhone 6s, depending on their precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

## [[battery_life_and_charging|Battery Life]]

While the iPhone 6s introduces many improvements, one specification that is technically worse than before is the battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. The new iPhones feature a slightly smaller battery compared to previous models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

Specifically:
*   The iPhone 6s has a battery capacity of 1715 milliamp-hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.
*   The iPhone 6s Plus has a battery capacity of 2750 milliamp-hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

Despite the reduced capacity, the overall [[battery_life_and_charging|battery life]] remains approximately the same as the previous generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

### iPhone 6s [[battery_life_and_performance_of_iphone_6|Battery Performance]]
The [[battery_life_and_performance_of_iphone_6|battery life]] of the iPhone 6s is generally "okay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. It should typically last a full day under normal usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. However, during days of heavy use, users might find themselves needing to charge the device before the end of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

### iPhone 6s Plus [[battery_life_and_performance_of_iphone_6|Battery Performance]]
The iPhone 6s Plus offers significantly better [[battery_life_and_performance_of_iphone_6|battery life]], which is a benefit of its larger size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. The 6s Plus boasts one of the best [[battery_life_and_charging|battery life]] performances among smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. It features excellent standby time, allowing users to potentially forget to charge it overnight without worry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. Even after normal or heavy use throughout the day, the iPhone 6s Plus can end the day with 20% to 30% [[battery_life_and_charging|battery life]] remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

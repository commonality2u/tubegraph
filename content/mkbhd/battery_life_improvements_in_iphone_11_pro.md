The [[iphone_11_pro_battery_and_performance | iPhone 11 Pro]] sees significant improvements in [[iphone_11_pro_battery_and_performance | battery life]], which was one of Apple's four major focuses for this model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50"></a>.

### Key Factors for Battery Improvement

The enhanced [[iphone_11_pro_battery_and_performance | battery life]] in the [[iphone_11_pro_battery_and_performance | iPhone 11 Pro]] is primarily attributed to:
*   **Increased Battery Size** The phone is slightly thicker and heavier, with the Pro Max being 20 grams heavier than its predecessor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43"></a>. This additional weight and thickness are due to the inclusion of a larger battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11"></a>.
*   **Removal of 3D Touch** Apple removed the pressure-sensitive display hardware for 3D Touch, creating more internal space for a bigger battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09"></a>. Haptic Touch, which uses long presses, has largely replaced the functionality of 3D Touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55"></a>.
*   **A13 Bionic Chip** The new A13 Bionic chip contributes to efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16"></a>. While the battery difference from the iPhone XR to the iPhone 11 was one hour, mainly due to [[software_and_features_in_iphone_11_pro | A13 Bionic]] improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16"></a>, the [[battery_enhancements_in_iphone_13_pro | iPhone 11 Pro]]'s gains were more substantial.
*   **Efficient Display** The new Super Retina XDR display is also more efficient, further contributing to [[iphone_11_pro_battery_and_performance | battery gains]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22"></a>.

### Performance and Claims
The improvement from the iPhone XS to the [[iphone_11_pro_battery_and_performance | iPhone 11 Pro]] is stated to be four hours of additional battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24"></a>. In practice, with high brightness and constant use, the [[iphone_11_pro_battery_and_performance | iPhone 11 Pro]] delivered seven to eight hours of screen-on time and a full day of [[iphone_11_pro_battery_and_performance | battery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43"></a>. It's suggested that intentionally trying to drain the battery within a single day would be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49"></a>.

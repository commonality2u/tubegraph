Pablo Escobar, a Colombian drug lord, was known as the wealthiest criminal in history due to his monopoly on the cocaine trade into the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. His notorious legacy includes being known for the killings of police officers and politicians, and making Colombia the murder capital of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. He died from a gunshot wound to the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Despite the negative sentiment associated with his name, it remains widely recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Escobar Inc. and the Folding Phone Controversy

In 2020, amidst the rise of folding smartphones, a new device surfaced under the "Escobar" name, generating significant attention across tech websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This company, Escobar Inc., positioned itself as a player in the tech market with a folding phone priced at $350 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

The initial "Escobar Fold" was identified as a Royole FlexPai with a gold accent taped onto it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Later, the "Escobar Fold 2" was marketed at $400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Upon inspection, this device was found to be a Samsung Galaxy Fold, including its dust caps and stiffer hinge, with a gold tinfoil adhesive covering the Samsung logo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. The foil could be removed to reveal the original Samsung branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Essentially, it was a poorly rebranded, fully functional Galaxy Fold, lacking the original packaging contents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### Key Figures

The main individuals associated with Escobar Inc. are Roberto Escobar, Pablo Escobar's older brother and chief of assassinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>, and Olaf Gustafson, the CEO of Escobar Inc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Gustafson, described as a younger, tech-savvy individual, appears to have convinced Roberto to leverage the Escobar name for profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

### [[marketing_tactics_of_escobar_inc | Marketing Tactics of Escobar Inc.]]

The company's marketing efforts are notable for their unconventional and aggressive approach:
*   Their website was described as "a little suspect," featuring "pretty wild pictures and statements" and "bold claims," appearing unprofessional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   The CEO's Twitter account frequently shares articles and photos with celebrities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   They attempted to get Elon Musk to stop selling his Boring Company flamethrowers by cloning the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   They also supported Roberto Escobar in launching a cryptocurrency that did not succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   Their YouTube channel features curious content, including a video of five fold phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a> and an explicit unboxing video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   A particularly aggressive [[marketing_tactics_of_escobar_inc | marketing tactic]] included a video titled "RIP Samsung.com" where original Samsung Galaxy Folds were smashed with sledgehammers until they caught fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. The Escobar team bought the URL ripsamsung.com, which redirects to escobarinc.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, despite their product's reliance on Samsung's technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   [[celebrity_endorsements_and_influence_on_sales | Celebrity endorsements]] were used, featuring Chris Hansen and Anna Anka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. These individuals likely produced the videos through platforms like Cameo, where users can pay for personalized messages, and were probably unaware their videos were being used to promote what appears to be a scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

### Shipping and Deception

The company frequently fails to ship products to general customers. Instead, they appear to prioritize shipping to YouTubers, tech media, or individuals they believe will generate positive publicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. This strategy aims to create a perception that the phone is a legitimate product. Many customers who placed orders, including two orders made by MKBHD himself, never received their phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Orders were only shipped after the company was publicly called out by tech reviewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

Given the prevalence of unfulfilled orders and the deceptive rebranding of existing products, it is strongly advised not to purchase anything from Escobar Inc. or any associated entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

The [[AirPods Pro 2 design and new features | AirPods Pro 2]] introduce significant advancements in audio quality and features, primarily driven by the new H2 chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:44">[03:59:44]</a>.

## [[AirPods Pro sound quality | Sound Quality]]

The new AirPods Pro feature an entirely new driver and amplifier, resulting in dramatically better sound compared to the previous generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>. They are considered the best-sounding earbuds Apple has ever made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Key improvements include:
*   More pronounced lows and mids, which is very noticeable for hip-hop or music with a lot of bass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.
*   Very little high-volume distortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.
*   A responsive and crisp overall sound profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.
*   While there is no lossless audio, they still support 16-bit 48 kHz audio, which is considered good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.
*   [[AirPods Pro sound quality | Computational audio]] actively adjusts the EQ for everything listened to and across different volume levels to maintain a specific sound profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.

## H2 Chip

The H2 chip is the second generation of Apple's custom audio chip, replacing the H1 chip found in previous Apple headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. This chip is responsible for audio processing, noise cancellation, and other features, enabling everything special about these new AirPods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. Apple has stated it contains "a billion transistors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

## [[Improved noise cancellation and transparency mode | Active Noise Cancellation]]

Thanks to the H2 chip, the active noise cancellation is much improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. Apple claims it removes up to two times more background noise than the last generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. This improvement, combined with the new drivers and sound profile, is definitely noticeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.
*   It's particularly effective with white noise, such as air conditioners and transportation sounds, which are immediately "erased" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.
*   The noise cancellation capabilities are comparable to the Sony Mark IV earbuds and are positioned just below the new Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.
*   Notably, the [[Improved noise cancellation and transparency mode | AirPods Pro 2]] are considered to cancel more sound than the [[airpods_pro_2_design_and_new_features | AirPods Max]], despite the [[airpods_pro_2_design_and_new_features | AirPods Max]] having a much bigger driver and a different sound profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.

## [[Improved noise cancellation and transparency mode | Adaptive Transparency Mode]]

A standout feature enabled by the H2 chip is "adaptive transparency mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. While still named "transparency mode," it has advanced capabilities:
*   It continues to pass through all outside sound in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.
*   Crucially, if there's a loud or harsh sound above 85 dB, the mode automatically cuts that sound down to a non-damaging level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.
*   For instance, when walking in a city and needing to hear cars or people for safety, an ambulance siren will still be audible, but its super loud sound will be suppressed to a level that doesn't hurt the ears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. This also applies to honking, jackhammers, construction noise, or dog barking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.
*   It maintains the sound signature of the loud noise while bringing its volume down below a certain level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.
*   This real-time processing happens with virtually no delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.
*   The earbuds sample outside sound 48,000 times per second, which is 240 times faster than the previous generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. This allows it to instantly reduce even sharp, quick sounds like a dog barking, so by the time it reaches the ear, it's at a lower volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.
*   This feature is so effective that it could potentially be used at loud concerts instead of earplugs, taking the entire sound signature and dropping it to a reasonable level, allowing listeners to still feel the bass but protecting their hearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>.
*   All this real-time processing occurs on the earbuds themselves, not the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.

## Other H2 Chip Features

The H2 chip also enables additional useful functionalities:
*   It communicates with the Noise app on the Apple Watch in real-time, showing how much noise is being canceled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.
*   If a wrong earbud (e.g., someone else's) is accidentally placed in the case, the speaker will play a chime, and a "mismatched AirPods" notification will appear on the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>.

## Personalized Spatial Audio

The [[AirPods Pro 2 design and new features | AirPods Pro 2]] introduce an ear scan feature for personalized spatial audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>.
*   It utilizes the Face ID depth sensors to measure the user's head and the depth of their ears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.
*   This data is used to create a personalized spatial audio mix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>.
*   While Sony has a similar feature using a front-facing camera, the immediate usefulness of Apple's implementation might not be universally convincing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>.
*   For some, personalized audio may result in the sound stage feeling a bit wider, with more spread between different sounds and instrumentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. This is another example of computational audio at work, thanks to the H2 chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.

Overall, the [[AirPods Pro 2 design and new features | AirPods Pro 2]] are a significant upgrade, offering better [[sound_quality_and_performance | sound quality]], improved noise cancellation, and a much better transparency mode, making them an excellent choice, especially for those who wear AirPods constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

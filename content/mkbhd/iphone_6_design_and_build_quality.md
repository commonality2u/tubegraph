The iPhone 6 introduced a new design for Apple's flagship phone, centered on themes of thinness and lightness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Physical Characteristics

The iPhone 6 is notably thin, measuring 6.9 millimeters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This extreme thinness is described as "crazy thin" and almost feeling "too thin and light to be a working phone," akin to the weight of a dummy phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

The phone is constructed from a single piece of aluminum, with rounded corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Unlike previous iPhones with squared-off edges, Apple rounded the sides, making the phone feel more like the HTC One M8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This design contributes to a seamless feel across the body, where a finger can be dragged from the screen around to the back without encountering any seams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Ergonomics and Grip

While seamless, the smooth finish and light weight make the device "a bit slippery to hold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This slipperiness, combined with its increased size and lightness, can diminish confidence in holding and manipulating the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. High-quality skins, such as those from dbrand, are suggested to improve grip ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Size and Form Factor

The iPhone 6 is larger than the `[[iphone_5s_design_and_build_quality | iPhone 5s]]`, a size adjustment that is generally preferred and quick to get used to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. After using the iPhone 6, the `[[iphone_5s_design_and_build_quality | iPhone 5s]]` can appear "like a toy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Despite having a 4.7-inch display, the iPhone 6 is somewhat larger than other phones of similar screen size due to its prominent "chin" for the home button and a matching "forehead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The main physical advantage of the iPhone 6 over older models is its larger screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Camera Protrusion

Due to the phone's extreme thinness, the camera lens on the back slightly protrudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This is not considered a major issue, as the lens is coated in sapphire, though it causes the phone to rock slightly when placed on a flat surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Button and Port Placement

The iPhone 6 is the first iPhone to move the power button from the top to the side of the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This change is beneficial for larger phones, making the button much easier to reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. It also retains a physical mute switch, a feature appreciated by the reviewer, although it occasionally switches off in a pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Build Integrity and Speaker Quality

Despite some mixed feelings about its "razor thin" build, the phone is "definitely built well" and "shouldn't bend in your pocket or anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

A notable quirk in the hardware is the speaker located on the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. While loud with decent mids and highs, it can be a bit tinny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Being a small, downward-facing driver, it is very easy to accidentally block when holding the phone for video watching or gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Comparison to iPhone 6 Plus

Factors that make the iPhone 6 "a little bit slippery" and "difficult to hold" are "amplified" on the larger iPhone 6 Plus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The iPhone 6 Plus is even bigger in every way and retains the rounded edges, making it "even more difficult to grip" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Suggestions for Improvement

The reviewer expresses a wish for the phone to be slightly thicker, which could allow for a larger battery (e.g., 2000 or 2100 mAh) and eliminate the camera protrusion, potentially also making it easier to hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

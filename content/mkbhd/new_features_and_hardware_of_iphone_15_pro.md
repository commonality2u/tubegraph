When a product line undergoes incremental changes, it highlights the few modifications that are actually made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Much like the [[Porsche 911]] which has maintained a similar appearance for 50 years with slight evolutions each generation, new iPhones are also refined over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The [[iPhone 15 Pro advanced features | iPhone 15 Pro]] is a result of years of development, adding up to significant changes over a long period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Overall Philosophy

Users do not need to upgrade to the newest phone every year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Products like the Zenfone 10 or ROG phone also follow a refinement model, focusing on fixing issues and making small, clever improvements each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The [[iPhone 15 Pro advanced features | iPhone 15 Pro]] continues this trend, introducing improvements while also presenting some potential new issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Key New Features

The [[iPhone 15 Pro advanced features | iPhone 15 Pro]] introduces four main new features unique to this model: the build, the chip, the cameras, and the Action Button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Design and Build Changes

Apple updated the build and materials of the [[iPhone 15 Pro design and build changes | iPhone 15 Pro]] this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>:
*   **Softer Corners and Curved Edges**: The corners have been softened, and the front glass has a gentle curve at the edges, which might make screen protectors more intricate but gives a nice look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Slimmer Bezels**: While screen sizes remain the same, the bezels are slightly slimmer all around, making the phone about one millimeter smaller diagonally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Titanium Rails**: The rails have switched from shiny stainless steel to a lighter, coated, and brushed titanium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Lighter Weight**: The phone is noticeably lighter than the previous Pro model, about 10% on paper, but it feels like more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **New Colors**: A new set of colors is available, with "Natural Titanium" being highlighted as the best new color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Darker colors show fingerprints easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

Upgrading solely for the titanium build or thinner bezels is not recommended if you have a perfectly working phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. However, when compared to an [[Software and features in iPhone 11 Pro | iPhone 11]], the cumulative differences become apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

## USB-C Port

The most significant build highlight is the new USB-C port at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Convenience**: This port makes a big difference for users with other gadgets like computers, headphones, mouse, and keyboard, allowing them to use one charger for everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **EU Mandate**: Apple was largely compelled by the EU to adopt USB-C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Limitations**: Charging speed did not improve, remaining at 25 watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. There is no extra desktop mode or DeX-like functionality to plug into a monitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **New Capabilities**:
    *   Reverse charging other phones at 4.5 watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
    *   Plugging in peripherals like keyboards or monitors (mirroring screen up to 4K 60) <a class="yt
class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
    *   The Pro phone supports USB 3.0 data transfer speeds, enabling noticeably faster transfer of ProRes footage and the ability to shoot video directly onto an external drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Cable Confusion**: The braided USB-C cable included in the box is only USB 2.0, meaning users need to purchase a separate, faster cable for USB 3.0 data transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

## A17 Pro Chip

The new powerhouse chip, the A17 Pro, is the main enabler of new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **Naming**: This is the first Apple chip with the "Pro" designation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Process Technology**: It is Apple's first three-nanometer chip and likely the first in any phone for at least another year or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   **Performance**: Benchmarks show it approaching M1 chip levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Compared to last year's chip, it is 10% to 20% more powerful on both the CPU and GPU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   **Real-world Impact**:
    *   **Gaming**: The A17 Pro enables console-level games like "Resident Evil: Village" and "Assassin's Creed" to run natively on the iPhone, using the same assets and textures as PlayStation versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
    *   **Dedicated Hardware**: The new Image Signal Processor allows for very fast, lag-free photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. The Neural Engine automatically recognizes Portrait Mode subjects (faces, dogs, cats) and allows users to apply Portrait Mode to regular photos after they are taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. The USB 3 controller for faster data transfer is also part of the A17 Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## Battery Life and Overheating Concerns

Initial observations suggest potential issues with battery life and overheating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Objective Metrics**: The phones have slightly bigger batteries and a new three-nanometer chip, which should theoretically improve battery life in controlled environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Benchmarks indicate they do last longer on simple tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   **Subjective Experience**: While there have been average and bad battery days, there haven't been any "amazing" days with nine hours of screen-on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **Overheating**: Overheating issues have been reported online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. The speaker experienced random overheating and battery drain, even in low-stress situations like Airplane Mode, rather than during heavy use like outdoor GPS tracking in hot weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   **Theories**: The A17 Pro's power might drain battery faster in high-intensity settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Additionally, issues are attributed to iOS 17 bugs, with ongoing updates expected to resolve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
*   **Expectation**: Battery life is expected to eventually normalize to be similar to last year's models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

## Camera Improvements

The "Pro" in [[New features of the iPhone 15 lineup | iPhones]] primarily refers to camera capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. The [[iPhone 15 Pro advanced features | iPhone 15 Pro]] features significant hardware and software advancements:
*   **Main Camera**: A new, larger 48-megapixel main camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
*   **Ultra Wide**: An improved ultrawide camera with closer macro capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   **Image Processing**: A new, intricate image processing pipeline is at work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
    *   **24MP Images**: By default, the camera outputs 24-megapixel images instead of 12-megapixel images (common in other 48MP phones) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. This is achieved by combining a 48-megapixel full sensor shot for detail and a 12-megapixel quad-binned shot for light and noise information using the neural net <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. The file size is only about 1.5 times larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
    *   **Quality**: Photos exhibit great dynamic range and sharpness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. iPhone remains one of the best point-and-shoot cameras for good results in full auto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
    *   **Macro Mode**: The improved Macro Mode is very good, and the primary camera's natural fall-off allows for blurred backgrounds without needing Portrait Mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.
    *   **Autofocus**: Autofocus is exceptionally fast, especially when faces are in the scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
    *   **Night Photos**: The larger sensor enhances night photography with longer handheld captures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
    *   **24MP vs 12MP Difference**: The 24-megapixel images offer a slight improvement in fine detail and contrast only when zoomed all the way in (pixel-peeping) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. Past 2x zoom, images revert to 12 megapixels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.
    *   **Focal Length Presets**: On the Pro phones, there are presets from the 1x lens: 24mm (zoomed out), 28mm (tighter), and 35mm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. These have dedicated image processing pipelines to maximize detail into "super res, zoom, focal lengths" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.
*   **Video Capabilities**: The [[iPhone 15 Pro advanced features | iPhone's]] video capabilities are far ahead of other smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.
    *   **Quality**: At 4K 30 in full auto, detail, autofocus, slight depth, dynamic range, and stabilization are all world-class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.
    *   **AV1 Codec**: The chip supports the new AV1 Codec, which works well with YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.
    *   **Log Shooting**: Users can now shoot in Log format, a professional camera feature, which provides more image information, a flat look, and greater dynamic range for post-production grading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. This feature is currently buried deep in the Settings app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.
    *   **Downside**: A notable issue is haloing from point light sources, especially in video, which appears to be worse on the iPhone compared to other phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.
*   **iPhone 15 Pro Max Telephoto Lens**: Only the [[iPhone 15 and 15 Pro major changes | iPhone 15 Pro Max]] includes the new 5x larger telephoto lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.
    *   **Zoom Range**: It increases max zoom from 15x to 25x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.
    *   **Trade-offs**: This lens requires a bigger phone, and 4x photos may be worse on this model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. It is not as capable as some longer telephoto periscope lenses, like Samsung's 10x optical lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
    *   **Apple's Advantage**: Apple's strength lies in stabilization, offering a zoom-in preview window and over-stabilizing the frame for detailed zoomed shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.
*   **Software and Taste**: The differences between modern smartphone cameras are largely due to software and user preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.
    *   **RAW Max/JPEG Max**: A "RAW Max" button takes 48-megapixel Pro RAW photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. To take 48-megapixel JPEGs, users must go into the Settings app, switch it over, and then the button changes to "JPEG Max" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.

## The Action Button

The [[iPhone 15 Pro advanced features | iPhone 15 Pro]] introduces an Action Button, exclusively for Pro models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.
*   **Customization**: It is a customizable button that replaces the least used button from previous [[iPhone 14 Pro features and innovations | iPhones]] (the mute switch) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.
*   **Functions**:
    *   Can remain a mute switch with strong haptics to indicate mute status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.
    *   Can be mapped to various functions, including launching the camera, voice recorder, or any app via Siri Shortcuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.
    *   Can perform specific actions within apps, such as unlocking a car or launching a new task in a task manager app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.
*   **Reachability**: It is not easily reachable for one-handed use, especially on the Pro Max, as it is located high on the corner above the volume buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.
*   **User Adoption**: Many users might experiment with it for a few days but eventually forget about it and revert it to a mute switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[New features of the iPhone 15 lineup | iPhone 15 Pro]] of 2023 is largely similar to its predecessor, but with key refinements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>. It features USB-C, a slightly faster chip, a brighter screen, thinner bezels, and improved cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. The USB-C port might be the most significant upgrade for many users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.

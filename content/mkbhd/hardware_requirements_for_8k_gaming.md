The ability to game in 8K resolution has become a significant topic of discussion, especially with the release of new consoles like the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. While new consoles represent a considerable generational leap, the PC gaming community asserts that "the real power still comes from the real computer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Achieving true [[8k_gaming_capabilities | 8K gaming capabilities]] requires a specific high-end hardware configuration.

## Key Hardware Components

For [[8k_gaming_capabilities | 8K gaming capabilities]], a robust system is essential, far surpassing previous attempts that required workarounds like two cables to stitch the display together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Graphics Card
The cornerstone of [[8k_gaming_capabilities | 8K gaming capabilities]] is a powerful graphics card.
*   **[[nvidia_geforce_rtx_3090 | Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090]]**
    *   This card is the highest-end in Nvidia's 3000 Series lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
    *   It is designed to be capable of things no new console can touch, specifically [[8k_gaming_capabilities | 8K gaming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
    *   The [[nvidia_geforce_rtx_3090 | 3090]] features HDMI 2.1 ports, which enable a single cable to output 8K resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Processor (CPU)
*   **Intel Core i9-10900K**
    *   Features 10 cores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
    *   Has a base clock speed of 3.7 GHz, turboing up to 5.3 GHz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### Memory (RAM)
*   **32 GB HyperX Fury RAM**
    *   Described as "fast" RAM, crucial for handling the demanding data throughput of 8K gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Motherboard
*   **MSI MPG Z490 Gaming Motherboard**
    *   A suitable motherboard for supporting the high-end components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Storage
*   **1 TB Samsung NVMe SSD (970 Pro)**
    *   Used as the boot drive for rapid system and game loading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **2 TB SSD**
    *   For additional mass storage of games and other data that doesn't require immediate access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Chassis
*   **Custom-built aluminum chassis**
    *   Features RGB lighting, a matte black exterior, and a tinted glass side panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### Display
*   **88-inch 8K OLED TV**
    *   While dedicated 8K gaming monitors are not yet mature, high-end 8K TVs like this one can serve as displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
    *   The display needs to be capable of 7680 by 4320 resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Cables
*   **HDMI 2.1 Cable**
    *   A thicker, more robust HDMI 2.1 cable is required to transmit 8K resolution over a single connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## [[gaming_performance_in_8k_resolution | Gaming performance in 8K resolution]]

With the described setup, [[gaming_performance_in_8k_resolution | gaming performance in 8K resolution]] can be spectacular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.

### Forza Horizon 4
*   The game was locked at 60 FPS in Autumn setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a> and Winter setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   The detail in leaves, trees, sky, snowflakes, and car interiors was significantly enhanced and crisper compared to lower resolutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   Every intentional detail, from fences to dirt splashes, becomes more noticeable, enhancing immersion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   Cut scenes in Forza Horizon 4 appear to be pre-rendered at lower resolutions (e.g., 1440p or 1080p), with a clear visual shift back to 8K when gameplay resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   Even with this powerful GPU, intense scenes with significant on-screen activity could see the FPS drop to around 50 FPS, pushing 30+ megapixels per frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

### Control Ultimate Edition
*   Initial [[gaming_performance_in_8k_resolution | performance in 8K resolution]] was around 52 FPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   Increasing the render resolution (for environmental details) to 5K significantly impacted performance, dropping frames per second to 21 FPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
*   Setting the game's actual resolution to 8K but the world's render resolution to 2K (or even 4K) allows for playable frame rates (e.g., 36 FPS at 4K render resolution) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. This indicates that the card is not "invincible" and may require some settings adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   Despite render resolution adjustments, the character and overall game quality remain high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
*   Games like Control benefit from 8K due to the high-quality textures, reflections, and character detail that enhance immersion, especially in horror games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

## Current State of 8K Gaming

While [[8k_gaming_capabilities | 8K gaming capabilities]] are now possible with high-end hardware like the [[nvidia_geforce_rtx_3090 | 3090]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>, the ecosystem for 8K gaming monitors is still nascent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. As of 2020, there isn't yet a widespread need to game in 8K <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. However, for those with the appropriate setup, [[gaming_performance_in_8k_resolution | gaming performance in 8K resolution]] at a high frame rate or high resolution is "spectacular" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. This level of [[gaming_performance_in_8k_resolution | performance]] allows PC gamers to definitively state that consoles cannot achieve the same 60 FPS at 8K resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

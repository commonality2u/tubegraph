When an [[iPhone 15 and 15 Pro major changes | iPhone]] generation doesn't introduce many changes, it tends to magnify the few alterations that are present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This approach of subtle, iterative refinement is comparable to the evolution of the Porsche 911, which has largely maintained its iconic look for 50 years with slight improvements each generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. The goal is to incrementally improve the product over time, leading to a more significant transformation over several generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

## Physical Design and Materials

Apple has updated the build and materials of the [[Design and build quality of the iPhone 15 Pro | iPhone 15 Pro]] this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>:
*   **Corners**: The corners have been softened slightly, though the design retains a boxy feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.
*   **Front Glass**: Instead of a completely flat front glass, there's a gentle curve at the very edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.
*   **Bezels**: While screen sizes remain the same, the bezels are now slightly slimmer all around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>, making the phone about one millimeter smaller diagonally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.
*   **Rails**: The rails have transitioned from shiny stainless steel to a lighter, coated, and brushed titanium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. This change contributes to the phone being noticeably lighter than its predecessor, feeling like more than the 10% reduction stated on paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.
*   **Colors**: A new set of colors has been introduced. The natural titanium color is highlighted as the best option, as dark or black [[Design and build quality of the iPhone 15 Pro | iPhones]] tend to show fingerprints easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. Concerns about light-colored scratches on the titanium were confirmed by JerryRigEverything's durability test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

For users with a perfectly functional phone, the titanium build or thinner bezels alone are not compelling reasons to upgrade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. However, when compared to older models like the [[iPhone 11 design and features | iPhone 11]], the compounding differences over time become apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

## USB-C Port

A significant change is the introduction of a new USB-C port at the bottom of the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>. This change, largely influenced by the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>, allows users to use a single charger for the phone, computers, headphones, and other peripherals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

Despite the port change:
*   Charging speed has not improved, remaining at 25 watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.
*   There is no "desktop mode" functionality similar to Samsung DeX for connecting to a monitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

However, the new port offers additional functionalities:
*   **Reverse Charging**: The [[Design and build quality of the iPhone 15 Pro | iPhone 15 Pro]] can reverse charge other phones at 4.5 watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.
*   **Peripheral Connectivity**: It can connect to external devices like keyboards and monitors, mirroring the screen at up to 4K 60Hz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.
*   **Data Transfer**: The Pro models support USB 3.0 data transfer speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>, allowing ProRes footage to be offloaded noticeably faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>. For the first time, video can also be shot directly onto an external drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.

The braided USB-C cable included in the box only supports USB 2.0 transfer speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>. For faster data transfer speeds, users will need to purchase a separate, more robust data cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.

## Action Button

The [[Design and build quality of the iPhone 15 Pro | iPhone 15 Pro]] introduces a new Action Button, exclusive to the Pro models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:40:00">[20:40:00]</a>. This customizable button replaces the traditional mute switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:02:00">[21:02:00]</a>.

Key features of the Action Button:
*   **Customization**: It can be mapped to various functions, including a mute switch with strong haptic feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:13:00">[21:13:00]</a>, launching the camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:23:00">[21:23:00]</a>, a voice recorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:25:00">[21:25:00]</a>, or virtually any app or specific action within an app via Siri Shortcuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:27:00">[21:27:00]</a>.
*   **Ergonomics**: It's positioned on the upper corner above the volume buttons, which might not be easily reachable for one-handed use, especially on the Pro Max <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:15:00">[22:15:00]</a>.
*   **Alternative Uses**: While it could function as a camera shutter button, the volume buttons already offer this functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:27:00">[22:27:00]</a>.

The Action Button is praised for its customization potential but might be overlooked by some users due to its placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:09:00">[21:09:00]</a>.

### Conclusion

The [[Design and build quality of the iPhone 15 Pro | iPhone 15 Pro]] is described as largely the same phone as the previous year, with key distinctions being the USB-C port, a faster chip (A17 Pro), a brighter screen, thinner bezels, and improved cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:06:00">[24:06:00]</a>. The USB-C port is highlighted as potentially the most significant change, despite Apple's initial marketing focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:22:00">[24:22:00]</a>.

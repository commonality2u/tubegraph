The [[display_and_screen_updates | iPhone 14 Pro]] and [[display_and_screen_updates | 14 Pro Max]] introduce the always-on display feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. While this functionality has been available on other phones for many years, Apple is implementing it "the Apple way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

## Functionality and Design

When the phone is put to sleep by pressing the power button, the [[display_and_screen_updates | LTPO OLED display]] brightness drops, and the refresh rate goes down to one Hertz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This allows the screen to continuously show the clock and notifications, resembling a dimmed version of the lock screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

Key visual aspects include:
*   A "pretty bright" always-on display, which can initially be mistaken for the phone being fully on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   A smooth fade animation when transitioning from the home screen to the always-on display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   The ability to maintain all colors, skin tones, and the original wallpaper, rather than appearing faded or black and white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   If music is playing, the album art and a color-matching waveform are displayed prominently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

## Limitations and User Experience

Despite its aesthetic appeal, some observations suggest drawbacks to Apple's implementation:
*   There are no apparent functional advantages compared to how other manufacturers have approached always-on displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   Customization options are severely limited, with only an "on or off" toggle in the display settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   The always-on display appears to slightly impact battery life more than expected, though its usage is not directly visible in battery settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

The display intelligently turns off in certain situations:
*   When the phone is in a pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   When [[ios_17_standby_mode | Sleep Mode]] is activated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   When an Apple Watch is being worn and the user moves far enough away from the phone that it's no longer visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

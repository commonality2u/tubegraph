The camera system on the Galaxy S22 series represents a significant upgrade, offering solid and reliable performance rather than revolutionary changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:15">[07:56:15]</a>. The overall impression is one of quiet competence, much like the "boring, Tim Duncan with the bank shot level solid" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:43">[02:29:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:08">[07:27:08]</a>.

## Hardware Specifications

The Galaxy S22 features a new camera setup:
*   **Main Camera** A 50-megapixel main camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:56">[07:39:56]</a>.
*   **Ultrawide Camera** A 10-megapixel 110-degree ultrawide camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:07">[07:42:07]</a>.
*   **Telephoto Camera** Another 10-megapixel 3x telephoto camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:03">[07:44:03]</a>.

## Image Quality

The camera system is described as "really good," though not "mind-blowing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:19">[07:54:19]</a>. This has been likened to Harrison Barnes rather than [[kevin_durant_brooklyn_nets|Kevin Durant]] in terms of impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:31">[07:50:31]</a>.

*   **General Performance** In normal lighting conditions, the camera handles situations well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:11">[08:02:11]</a>.
*   **Color and Processing** Samsung's colors are well-balanced, and the processing avoids being overly sharp or saturated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:07">[08:05:07]</a>.
*   **Ultrawide** The ultrawide camera is softer than the main camera but still performs well in good light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:35">[08:12:35]</a>.
*   **Telephoto** The telephoto camera is "rock solid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:11">[08:16:11]</a>.
*   **Consistency** There are no issues with HDR haloing, white balance inconsistencies, or autofocus problems, and shutter lag is minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:18">[08:18:18]</a>.

## Video Capabilities

*   **8K Video** The S22 no longer punches into a 3x crop when shooting 8K video, which was an issue on previous models where the higher resolution camera was the telephoto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:04">[08:33:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:01">[08:42:01]</a>. Instead, it uses a small crop on the main sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:03">[08:49:03]</a>.
    *   The crop on the S22 is smaller than on the S22 Ultra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:05">[08:53:05]</a>.
*   **Frame Rate Limitation** Despite advancements, 8K video is still limited to 24 frames per second (FPS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:47">[09:09:47]</a>. While Snapdragon chips have supported 8K 30 FPS video for the last three generations, Samsung has not included this option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:26">[09:24:26]</a>.

## Software Enhancements

Samsung has introduced several software improvements for the cameras:
*   **Nightography** This feature enhances detail in night shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:18">[09:45:18]</a>.
*   **AI Stereo Portrait Mode** Improves cutouts in portrait mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:08">[09:53:08]</a>.
*   **Space Zoom Stability Locking** Enhances stability when using zoom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:04">[09:55:04]</a>.
*   **Auto Framing** Can track up to 10 faces within a frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:05">[09:58:05]</a>.
*   **Expert Raw App** A new, separate application for raw image capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:07">[10:01:07]</a>.
    *   *Note:* More detailed discussions on these features are expected in the S22 Ultra review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:14">[10:04:14]</a>.

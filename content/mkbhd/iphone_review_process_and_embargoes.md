Every year, a new iPhone is released, featuring incremental improvements in speed and strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Apple, known as a master of messaging, typically holds an elaborate on-stage presentation with high-quality video production to showcase the device as "the greatest iPhone they've ever made" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## The Reviewer's Role

A standard practice for Apple is to provide new iPhones to reviewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Reviewers are professionals whose job it is to spend approximately a week testing the device, identifying likes and dislikes, evaluating new features, and verifying claims made by Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. All of these findings are then distilled into a single comprehensive review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Embargoes

All parties involved in the review process adhere to a specific date—known as an embargo—before which they are not allowed to discuss their experiences with the new phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This ensures a "first wave" of reviews and impressions videos are released simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Challenges of Reviewing

Reviewing an iPhone is fundamentally "a balancing act" due to limited time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. It is impossible to meaningfully test every new feature, and significant time is also required for writing, analyzing results, and video production (shooting, editing, color correction, music) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Being a video reviewer on YouTube can feel like "nine different jobs in one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Decisions must be made about what to include in the review and what to leave out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Review Length and Style

Review styles vary, with some being short and dense (around 5 minutes) and others longer (10 minutes or more) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The goal is to provide as much information as possible in the shortest amount of time, while also considering audience metrics and retention on platforms like YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Ultimately, a review is "the art of compressing and distilling as much useful information as possible into one piece" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, meaning different reviewers will focus on different aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

This particular video aims to remove time limits, providing a comprehensive overview based on five months of use with the [[iPhone 12 unboxing experience | iPhone 12 Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. It primarily focuses on the [[iPhone 12 unboxing experience | iPhone 12 Pro]] but also references other models in the iPhone 12 lineup, such as the 12 Mini and 12 Pro Max <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## Key Aspects of iPhone Reviews

Reviewers delve into various aspects of the iPhone, which often become points of discussion or [[controversies_and_challenges_faced_by_iphone_models | controversies]].

### Design
The refreshed design of the [[iPhone 12 unboxing experience | iPhone 12 series]] is always a significant focus, as it tends to be what most people anticipate and what visually identifies the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Reviewers often highlight:
*   The flat sides, reminiscent of the iPhone 4/4S/5/5S, which provide more internal volume and a different grip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   The finishes, such as the matte back of the Pro model that resists fingerprints, contrasted with the glossy camera bump and stainless steel rails that attract dust and fingerprints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   The overall size, with the [[iPhone 12 unboxing experience | iPhone 12 Pro]] being considered a "great size" for usability without requiring "hand gymnastics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. The iPhone 12 Mini is noted as the "best compact flagship phone" despite battery shortcomings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   Premium features like IP68 certification for dust and water resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   The persistence of the Lightning port in a USB-C world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   The highly underrated haptics, enabled by a large "taptic engine" that delivers precise, convincing vibrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   The triple camera array's resemblance to a "stove top" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

### Screen
The display is often a controversial area in iPhone reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. Past models like the [[controversies_and_challenges_faced_by_iphone_models | iPhone 10R]] faced criticism for a lower-resolution LCD screen, though it was ultimately deemed "fine" by users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. For the [[iPhone 12 unboxing experience | iPhone 12 Pro]], key discussion points include:
*   Its flat 6.1-inch OLED display with 2532x1170 resolution (460 ppi), 1200 nits max brightness, HDR certification, and wide P3 color gamut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   The large notch at the top, housing Face ID components, which remains unchanged despite other manufacturers shrinking or eliminating notches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. Reviewers lament Face ID's limitations at various angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.
*   The 60Hz refresh rate, making it "the most expensive new phone that doesn't have a high refresh rate display" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. While the iPhone is considered a "smooth 60 hertz phone" due to its 120Hz touch sample rate and overall performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>, many hope for 120Hz in future models, as seen on the iPad Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.
*   "Ceramic Shield" glass, touted for "four times better drop performance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. Reviewers note it still scratches and shatters like other glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>, with any improvement likely due to the flat design absorbing impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. Its flatness makes it the easiest phone to apply a screen protector to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

### Cameras
Smartphone cameras are a primary differentiator, leading to extensive testing in reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. The [[iPhone 12 unboxing experience | iPhone 12 Pro]] features a triple-camera system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.
*   **Consistency:** iPhone cameras are lauded for providing "good consistent point and shoot photos" and "high quality videos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. There isn't a significant year-over-year difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.
*   **Ease of Use:** The iPhone camera system is designed for simplicity, making complex results achievable with minimal effort, embodying Steve Jobs's vision of being both "smart" and "easy to use" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.
*   **Software Processing:** Features like Smart HDR, multiple exposures, and computational photography handle much of the heavy lifting, prioritizing faces even if it sacrifices other image details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.
*   **Manual Control:** A drawback noted by reviewers is the lack of a "pro mode" in the stock camera app, though ProRAW and third-party apps offer more flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.
*   **Competition:** While the iPhone excels at point-and-shoot, it can be surpassed in edge cases, such as zoom capabilities (maxing at 12x digital zoom compared to competitors' 10x optical and triple-digit digital zoom) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.
*   **Video:** The iPhone's video capabilities, particularly due to superior app support (e.g., Instagram, Snapchat), are often cited as its strongest point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.
*   **Dolby Vision HDR:** While [[iPhone 12 unboxing experience | iPhone 12 series]] phones were the first to be Dolby Vision certified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>, its adoption and compatibility in external sharing remain limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>.

### MagSafe
MagSafe is highlighted as a "most interesting new feature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>, especially with rumors of Apple eventually removing the charging port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>.
*   **Functionality:** It's a magnetic wireless charging puck that aligns with the iPhone's back and charges at 15 watts (12 watts for the 12 Mini) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.
*   **Utility:** Critics point out it doesn't provide the same "safe" utility as original MagSafe, as the phone can still be pulled off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>.
*   **Ecosystem Potential:** There's hope for a broader ecosystem of magnetic accessories, though initial third-party options like car mounts have shown mixed reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.
*   **Charging Speed:** MagSafe's 15-watt limit is a significant drawback compared to much faster wireless charging speeds (40-120 watts) seen from competitors, though it's better for long-term battery health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.

### Battery
The [[iPhone 12 unboxing experience | iPhone 12 Pro]] has a 3,687 mAh battery, which is relatively small compared to other flagship smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>. However, due to "iPhone's efficiency, their vertical integration, their optimization," the on-paper number is less important than actual day-to-day performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>.
*   **Performance:** It can consistently achieve six to seven hours of screen-on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.
*   **Long-term Health:** After five months, the battery health still shows 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>.
*   **Charging Speed:** Apple has consistently not led the industry in charging speed or battery size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>.

### Software & Ecosystem
The iPhone is more than just hardware; it's the software (iOS) and the surrounding ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>.
*   **Consistency:** iOS offers an "incredibly consistent" experience, with older iPhones receiving the same software as new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>.
*   **Widgets:** Introduced in iOS 14, widgets are seen as "better and worse at the same time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>. While Apple's implementation is polished, there are fewer third-party widgets and less customization compared to Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>.
*   **App Library:** The App Library provides a centralized location for all apps, reducing the need for every app on a home screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>.
*   **Ecosystem Growth:** Apple's ecosystem continually expands with products like HomePod Mini and AirPods Max, making it harder for users to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>.
*   **Criticisms:** Persistent annoyances for reviewers include the power button triggering Siri instead of simply turning off the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>, and numerous settings being separated from their respective apps into the main Settings app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:29">[00:36:29]</a>.

### 5G
The arrival of 5G on the [[iPhone 12 unboxing experience | iPhone 12 series]] was highly anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a>.
*   **Reality vs. Hype:** While the iPhone has introduced millions of users to 5G, the infrastructure rollout is slow, and 5G speeds are not dramatically better than 4G, often being worse, except in close proximity to millimeter-wave towers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>.
*   **Battery Impact:** Apple has minimized 5G's effect on battery life through intelligent power management, connecting to 5G only when high data usage is detected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>.

## "iPhone Gates" and the Charger Controversy

Every new iPhone release often triggers a "rapid and dramatic search for literally anything that could be possibly wrong," leading to "gates" like AntennaGate or BendGate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>. For the [[iPhone 12 unboxing experience | iPhone 12 series]], the most significant "gate" has been the absence of a charger in the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>.
*   **Apple's Explanation:** Apple cited environmental benefits, such as reduced e-waste and more efficient shipping due to smaller packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>.
*   **Critique:** Reviewers argue that while some e-waste is saved, the included USB-C to Lightning cable often necessitates buying a new USB-C charging brick, potentially negating environmental benefits and incurring extra cost for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:27">[00:43:27]</a>. This practice has since been adopted by other manufacturers like Xiaomi and Samsung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>, echoing the trend seen with the removal of the headphone jack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:15">[00:44:15]</a>.
*   **Industry Impact:** The concern is that this trend might halt innovation in battery and charging technology across the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:35">[00:44:35]</a>. This ripple effect on the rest of the smartphone world makes the iPhone a fascinating product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.

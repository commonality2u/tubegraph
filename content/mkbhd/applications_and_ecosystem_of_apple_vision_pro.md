The [[Apple Vision Pro features and specifications | Apple Vision Pro]] operates on VisionOS, a new system that adapts the familiar Apple interface to a three-dimensional space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>. It is described as being similar to iPadOS but with a more glassy appearance and an added dimension of 3D space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>. The primary [[User experience and eye tracking with Apple Vision Pro | input method]] for the [[Apple Vision Pro features and specifications | Vision Pro]] relies on [[User experience and eye tracking with Apple Vision Pro | eye tracking]] and hand gestures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. Users select items by looking at them and then pinching their fingers together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>, and can scroll by pinching and pulling as if on a string <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>. A digital crown on the headset brings up the app drawer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.

## App Types

There are two main types of applications available on the [[Apple Vision Pro features and specifications | Vision Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:00">[15:39:00]</a>:
1.  **Apps built specifically for Vision Pro**: These are designed to take full advantage of the device's unique capabilities and spatial computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[15:43:00]</a>.
2.  **Compatible iPhone and iPad apps**: These are existing apps that function on the [[Apple Vision Pro features and specifications | Vision Pro]] if the developer has not opted out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>.

### Native VisionOS Apps

Apple's stock apps, pre-installed on the [[Apple Vision Pro features and specifications | Vision Pro]], are examples of native VisionOS applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>. These apps, such as Apple Music, Notes, and Settings, feature a "glassy" and "frosted" UI design that allows for seeing through to the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>. They also cast shadows to reinforce their presence in the 3D space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>. Users can drag these app windows around in X, Y, and Z space, and resize them from the corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.

Specific examples of native applications include:
*   **Apple Music**: Offers all standard functionalities within a visually distinct, glassy window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:17]</a>.
*   **Apple TV and Disney+**: Come pre-installed and include custom environments for media consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:44:00">[16:44:00]</a>. The Apple TV app features a collection of videos shot in a proprietary format specifically for the [[Apple Vision Pro features and specifications | Vision Pro]], providing a full 180-degree immersive video experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52:00">[16:52:00]</a>.
*   **Photos app**: Allows for viewing panoramic photos in a fully immersive view, with a parallax effect that makes it feel like looking into a window of your own photo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>.

Third-party apps also exist that were built for VisionOS:
*   **Sky Guide**: Enables users to explore a realistic representation of the sky and constellations, pulling out information for specific celestial bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:00">[17:30:00]</a>.
*   **Jig Space**: Allows users to load and manipulate 3D models in their physical space, taking advantage of the [[Apple Vision Pro features and specifications | Vision Pro]]'s excellent spatial positioning lock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:47:00">[17:47:00]</a>.
*   **Keynote**: While allowing normal editing, it offers an immersive environment for practicing presentations, including options like a conference room or the Steve Jobs Theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:00]</a>.

Currently, no single native app is considered a "killer app" that justifies the [[Pricing and potential market for Apple Vision Pro | headset's high price]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:49:00">[18:49:00]</a>.

### Compatible Apps and Limitations

The [[Apple Vision Pro features and specifications | Vision Pro]] features a folder of "Compatible Apps" on its home screen, which largely consist of iPhone and iPad apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:00">[19:07:00]</a>. These apps generally retain the exact same functionality as their iPad counterparts; for example, Apple Maps on [[Apple Vision Pro features and specifications | Vision Pro]] is simply the iPad app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:23:00">[19:23:00]</a>.

Notably, some major applications like Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify are not natively available on the [[Apple Vision Pro features and specifications | Vision Pro]] at launch, as their developers have actively chosen to opt out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a>. For such services, users can still access them through the Safari browser, which supports full-screen 4K video playback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:32:00">[20:32:00]</a>. However, this approach lacks features like offline video downloads available in dedicated apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:47:00">[20:47:00]</a>.

## Apple Ecosystem Integration

The true "killer app" of the [[Apple Vision Pro features and specifications | Vision Pro]] is its seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:55:00">[20:55:00]</a>. Upon logging in with an Apple ID, the device immediately pulls in existing data and services like iMessages, photos, and notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:02:00">[21:02:00]</a>. This strategy makes the [[Apple Vision Pro features and specifications | Vision Pro]] uniquely compelling to existing iPhone users who might not have considered other VR headsets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:14:00">[21:14:00]</a>.

### Mac Integration

A standout feature is the ability to connect to a Mac and use it as a virtual display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:37:00">[21:37:00]</a>. When connected, the Mac's physical display blacks out, and its screen transforms into a 4K window within the [[Apple Vision Pro features and specifications | headset]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:52:00">[21:52:00]</a>. Users can then manipulate this virtual monitor, making it as large, small, close, or far away as desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:11:00">[22:11:00]</a>. The physical keyboard and trackpad continue to control the Mac, even if it's a desktop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:02:00">[22:02:00]</a>.

A significant advantage is the ability to concurrently open other VisionOS apps alongside the Mac display, allowing for a multi-window workspace (e.g., Mac in the center, Safari or Messages windows floating nearby) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:22:00">[22:22:00]</a>. Control can seamlessly transition between the Mac and other VisionOS apps using the physical keyboard and trackpad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:38:00">[22:38:00]</a>. This feature is particularly compelling for productivity, such as video editing on a plane, offering a private, expansive display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:57:00">[22:57:00]</a>. However, a current [[Technical limitations and drawbacks of Apple Vision Pro | limitation]] is that only one virtual monitor can be used from the Mac at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:37:00">[23:37:00]</a>.

## Personas and Communication

A defining characteristic of the [[Apple Vision Pro features and specifications | Vision Pro]] is the concept of "Personas" and the outward-facing display of eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:06:00">[24:06:00]</a>. The eyes displayed on the outside are not a direct passthrough but a reconstructed representation based on [[User experience and eye tracking with Apple Vision Pro | internal sensors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:48:00">[24:48:00]</a>. These sensors track eyes at 90 frames per second and power Optic ID for secure login <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:57:00">[24:57:00]</a>.

Personas are digital representations of the user's face, created through a scanning process where the user removes the headset and turns their head and makes facial expressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:16:00">[27:16:00]</a>. This feature is currently in beta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:15:00">[31:15:00]</a>. While impressive, Personas can fall into the "uncanny valley" â€“ appearing not quite human due to minor inaccuracies, especially with hair and flowing elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:42:00">[31:42:00]</a>. The outward-facing eyes on the headset, also part of the Persona concept, are designed to indicate to external observers whether the wearer can see them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:24:00">[25:24:00]</a>. When the wearer is in passthrough mode, their reconstructed eyes appear; when fully immersed, a blue/purple glow signifies they cannot see out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:43:00">[25:43:00]</a>.

### FaceTime on Vision Pro

The FaceTime experience on the [[Apple Vision Pro features and specifications | Vision Pro]] is considered the most well-thought-out and futuristic application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:25:00">[32:25:00]</a>. During a FaceTime call, participants' Personas appear in glassy, floating windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:36:00">[32:36:00]</a>. The angle at which a user looks at a window matches the angle seen by the person on the call, creating realistic virtual eye contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:46:00">[32:46:00]</a>. Hand gestures are also tracked and appear at the correct angle towards the intended recipient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:17:00">[33:17:00]</a>.

[[Content consumption and applications on Apple Vision Pro | Spatial audio]] is highly developed, with voices originating from the virtual location of each participant's window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:43:00">[33:43:00]</a>. Moving a window around in the virtual space will adjust the perceived sound direction and distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:54:00">[33:54:00]</a>. When users are immersed in an environment, other call participants can appear through a "fog" if the user starts talking in their direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:02:00">[26:02:00]</a>.

In summary, the [[Apple Vision Pro features and specifications | Vision Pro]] offers compelling applications, particularly in its deeply integrated Apple ecosystem and advanced communication features like Personas and FaceTime. While it is a young category, these strengths are among its most impressive aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:09:00">[36:09:00]</a>.

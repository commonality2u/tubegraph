From its original design to the latest models, advancements have been made in every aspect, including cameras, processing power, software features, and design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. Over 14 years, 33 different models of iPhones have been released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

## The Original iPhone (2007)

Unveiled at Macworld 2007, the first iPhone was a legendary device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. Steve Jobs famously described it as "an iPod, a phone, a breakthrough internet communicator," all in one device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.

Key features and characteristics:

## Evolution in Numbers

Visualizing the changes over time provides a clear picture of the iPhone's evolution:

### Storage Capacity
The maximum storage capacity available on iPhones has steadily increased from 4GB or 8GB on the first iPhone to over 1000GB (1TB) on the latest models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:47:00">[29:47:00]</a>.

### Performance (RAM)
While performance has consistently surged upwards, the amount of RAM in iPhones was stable at 1GB for a period before steadily ramping up, though not as aggressively as some other smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:20:00">[30:20:00]</a>.

### Camera Megapixels
Camera megapixel count started at 2MP, reached 8MP, and then notched up to 12MP with the iPhone 6S <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:46:00">[30:46:00]</a>. Since then, every iPhone camera has remained at 12 megapixels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:56:00">[30:56:00]</a>.

### Screen Size
The iPhone maintained a 3.5-inch screen for several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:22:00">[31:22:00]</a> before the "dam broke," leading to progressively larger screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:24:00">[31:24:00]</a>. Apple has attempted to keep a smaller iPhone in the mix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:30:00">[31:30:00]</a>, but mini options may become rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:35:00">[31:35:00]</a>.

### Starting Prices (Off-Contract)
Starting prices, measured off-contract, show a clear upward trend from $499 for the first iPhone to $999 for the iPhone X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:45:00">[31:45:00]</a>. The most expensive iPhone available at the time of recording was $1599 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:13:00">[32:13:00]</a>.

### Sales
iPhone sales experienced a significant surge from roughly 2011 to 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:26:00">[32:26:00]</a>. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were the best-selling iPhones of all time and are considered the best-selling smartphones ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:33:00">[32:33:00]</a>. Currently, iPhone sales are plateauing as the market becomes saturated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:42:00">[32:42:00]</a>.

In total, over a billion iPhones are actively in use today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:26:00">[29:26:00]</a>.

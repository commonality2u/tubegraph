The initial launch of the Samsung Galaxy Fold was met with significant screen failures among early reviewers, which quickly unfolded across social media, particularly Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Several Galaxy Fold units broke in the hands of reviewers around the same time, due to separate but related reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Reviewer Experiences and Immediate Failures
MKBHD's own Galaxy Fold unit was among those that failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. His experience stemmed from attempting to remove what appeared to be a pre-installed screen protector on the device's main display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. He noted a thin lip around the inside screen, similar to typical screen protectors found on other Samsung phones like the Galaxy S10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Upon peeling this layer, the screen quickly went black, with portions flickering and malfunctioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. It became clear this was not a standard removable screen protector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

Samsung was understanding and replaced MKBHD's phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. However, shortly thereafter, other reviewers, including Dieter Bohn from The Verge, reported similar screen failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## [[different_scenarios_leading_to_galaxy_fold_screen_failures | Different Scenarios Leading to Galaxy Fold Screen Failures]]

Of the four Galaxy Fold units that initially broke among reviewers, the issues stemmed from two primary types of failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>:

1.  **Peeling the Protective Layer:**
    *   MKBHD's unit broke within seconds of peeling what he believed was a screen protector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
    *   Mark Gurman also peeled off the entire layer, which quickly led to the screen's death, degrading over 12 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
2.  **Damage Through Regular Use:**
    *   Dieter Bohn's unit developed a bulge under the film for an unknown reason, which eventually killed the screen with stuck pixels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
    *   Steve Kovach's unit also failed without the film being removed, potentially due to some damage, resulting in half the display malfunctioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

The failures not directly related to peeling the film were deemed "much more concerning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## The Misunderstood "Protective Layer"

The "screen protector" observed by reviewers was, in fact, an integral part of the Galaxy Fold's display structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Lack of Clear Warnings
Early review units of the Galaxy Fold did not include any on-device or in-box warnings not to remove this layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. MKBHD confirmed his unit's wrapper had no such text, and other reviewers like Lou and Joanna also did not receive any warnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

A warning later circulated on social media, reportedly from a T-Mobile carrier unit, stating:
> "The main screen includes a special protective layer. Peeling that protective layer or using any adhesives on the main screen such as a screen protector or stickers may cause damage." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>

This suggests that Samsung or carriers realized the need for a warning between the distribution of review units and retail availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

### Inherent Design Challenge
Even if users resisted the urge to peel the film, its design with a visible lip means it could still collect dust or begin to peel unintentionally through regular use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Joanna Stern's unit, which she didn't peel, had already started to lift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## [[samsungs_response_to_galaxy_fold_problems | Samsung's Response to Galaxy Fold Problems]]
Samsung issued a statement acknowledging the reports of display issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>:
*   They committed to thoroughly inspecting units that weren't obviously damaged by film removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   They clarified that the top protective layer is "part of the display structure designed to protect the screen from unintentional scratches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   They stated that removing this layer or adding adhesives may cause damage, and vowed to ensure this information is clearly delivered to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

The core issue appears to be the necessity of a soft plastic display for a folding phone, which is inherently more delicate than glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

## [[user_perception_and_future_of_foldable_phones | Implications for the Future of Foldable Phones]]

The Galaxy Fold's early failures dealt a significant blow to the public relations not just for Samsung, but for foldable phones as a category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Increased Skepticism:** These issues generated skepticism even for competing devices like the Huawei Mate X, particularly concerning how an external folding display would hold up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **Public Beta Test:** The first generation of the Galaxy Fold felt very much like a "public beta test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **User Error:** While robots can fold phones hundreds of thousands of times, real-world human use introduces variables like "user error" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The complex design, including moving parts, hinges, and lack of water resistance, presents new challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Optimism for the Future:** Despite the setbacks, there remains optimism that this is a hurdle on the path to genuinely good folding phones in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Fans of technology often root for new, experimental ideas to succeed, paving the way for improved second and third generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

Samsung had reportedly worked on the Galaxy Fold for eight years, indicating that the launched product was considered ready at that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. Failures are not uncommon in new tech products, from butterfly keys to wireless chargers and even exploding phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Reviewers play a crucial role in providing feedback on these early devices, and public use will reveal even more about their real-world performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

The Apple Card, initially announced at Apple's services event in March <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, is a physical titanium credit card designed as an extension of Apple Pay for iPhone users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Physical Design

The Apple Card is made of titanium with an all-matte white finish on both the front and back, presenting a "super clean" aesthetic typical of Apple hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

Key design elements include:
*   A precise laser cut-out featuring the cardholder's name and the Apple logo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   A chip on the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   A magnetic stripe on the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   Goldman Sachs and Mastercard logos on the back, identifying the issuing bank and card provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

While sharing the same thickness as a normal credit card, its metal construction makes it significantly heavier and less flexible, contributing to a more durable feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. A chamfered edge wraps around the card, designed to gleam and catch the light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The card fits into a normal wallet without issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. A potential concern regarding its design is how the white finish will wear over time, whether it will chip or discolor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Unboxing and Activation Experience

The Apple Card comes in colorful packaging with clear instructions for activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
To activate:
1.  Wake an [[iphone_x_design_and_hardware_review | iPhone]].
2.  Hold the top of the [[iphone_x_design_and_hardware_review | iPhone]] to the bottom of the card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
3.  The card appears in iOS, similar to pairing [[apple_airtags_unboxing | Airpods]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
4.  Activate within the Wallet app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Wallet App Integration and UI Design

The Apple Card's features are deeply integrated into the Wallet app on [[iphone_x_design_and_hardware_review | iPhone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

### Payment Interface
The app features a clean and intuitive user interface (UI) that allows users to adjust payment schedules with a slider to see how much interest they would pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. A red color in the UI actively discourages users from making only the minimum payment, aiming to reduce accumulated interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### Dynamic Card Color Gradient
A unique design feature within the app is the card's color gradient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. It starts completely white when no money has been spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. As money is spent at different merchants or categories, colors are added to the gradient, providing a visual representation of spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Purchases are instantly populated in the app, with the color update occurring literally half a second after a transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Purchase History and Mapping
The app provides a detailed purchase history for every transaction, allowing users to view them on a map. This feature helps users identify unrecognized transactions by showing their exact origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Security and Physical Card Design

The Apple Card incorporates several [[security_features_of_apple_card | security features]] tied into its design and app integration:
*   **Face ID Security:** All transactions and card access within the app are secured with Face ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. If the card is lost or stolen, it cannot be used without the linked [[iphone_x_design_and_hardware_review | iPhone]] and the owner's face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Remote Deactivation:** The card can be remotely deactivated from the Wallet app if it is lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **No Card Number/Signature:** The physical Apple Card has no visible card number or signature on its surface, enhancing [[security_features_of_apple_card | security]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. The card number is accessible securely within the Wallet app for online purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This contributes to the card's "super clean" look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

> [00:04:44] "it's just also very clean there's no card number on the card that's a little more secure I guess and there's no signature since that's not required anymore it's in the app so you just get this nice super clean look"

## Impression and Ecosystem Implications

While acknowledging its design and features, the card is characterized as a "status symbol / flex of the decade" due to its premium appearance and integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. However, it also serves as another tool designed to further integrate users into the Apple ecosystem, potentially making it harder for users to switch to non-[[iphone_x_design_and_hardware_review | iPhone]] devices if they rely on the card's features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

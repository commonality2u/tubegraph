## Display and Notch Details

The new 14-inch and 16-inch 2021 MacBook Pros feature impressive new displays and a top-notch design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### Display Features
The new displays are described as incredible, featuring 10-bit panels, Mini LED technology, HDR support, a 16:10 aspect ratio, nearly 4K resolution, and a high refresh rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. These are essentially a Mini Pro display XDR but with higher pixel density and refresh rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

While the [[Display and screen updates | display]] generally looks similar to previous MacBook Pros during typical use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>, it can reach a maximum brightness of 1600 nits when watching HDR content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. The thinner bezels around the [[Screen and display specifications | screen]] were a long-awaited improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. The [[Screen and display specifications | display]] maintains a taller 16:10 aspect ratio, with the menu bar positioned in this extra space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

The inclusion of ProMotion, Apple's adaptive refresh rate technology, means the display does not always operate at its 120Hz maximum, even when navigating the user interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. However, the higher refresh rate is noticeable in specific scenarios, such as moving the mouse, large animations (like swiping between spaces or the genie animation for minimizing windows), and scrubbing through a Final Cut Pro timeline, where the added smoothness is appreciated <a class="yt-timestamp" data= "00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Safari, however, reportedly still requires an update to fully support the adaptive frame rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

While these laptops are not the first with Mini LED, HDR, or high refresh rate screens, the combination of a 10-bit [[display and screen updates | display]], thinner bezels, and other features results in an overall great [[Screen and display specifications | display]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

### The Notch
The new MacBook Pros feature a notch at the top of the display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. This notch houses the new 1080p webcam, an ambient light sensor, and a small LED light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Despite the minimal hardware it contains, the notch's size is a notable design choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

During use, the notch tends to become unnoticeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. The mouse pointer can go underneath it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, and the software largely treats the [[Screen and display specifications | screen]] as if the notch isn't there; screenshots and screen recordings capture the full pixel area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. When an application goes full screen, the entire menu bar turns black, making the notch blend in with the now slightly thicker top bezel, which appears very deep black due to the Mini LED technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

The notch never cuts into actual content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>; instead, it utilizes "extra [[display and screen updates | display]]" space that was not present before, with the menu bar pushed into this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. There are some minor quirks, such as apps with many menu bar items potentially having them run underneath the notch, which may require software updates to implement features like scrolling or expansion buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

While some users may opt for third-party apps to black out the notch area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, it generally disappears from perception during active use even more so than on smaller phone screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. The expectation is that future versions of the laptop with a notch of this size would incorporate Face ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

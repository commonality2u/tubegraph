YouTube, as a platform, has evolved its approach to content presentation, particularly concerning its annual [[youtube_rewind_concept_and_evolution | YouTube Rewind]] video series. This evolution is largely driven by its commercial interests and the necessity to maintain strong relationships with advertisers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

## The Core Disconnect: Creators vs. YouTube
The primary issue with [[youtube_rewind_concept_and_evolution | YouTube Rewind]], as seen by many, stems from a fundamental difference in perception between [[creators_perspective_on_youtube_rewind | YouTubers]]/audiences and the YouTube company itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.
*   **[[creators_perspective_on_youtube_rewind | Creators']] and Audience View:** For many, [[youtube_rewind_concept_and_evolution | YouTube Rewind]] is seen as a grand celebration looking back at the biggest [[creators_perspective_on_youtube_rewind | YouTubers]], events, and memes that occurred on the platform throughout the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. Being included in Rewind became an "honor" for [[creators_perspective_on_youtube_rewind | creators]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.
*   **YouTube's Company View:** As YouTube scaled, it began to view [[youtube_rewind_concept_and_evolution | YouTube Rewind]] as a vital tool to showcase the platform's "best stuff" to advertisers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

## The "Adpocalypse" and Brand Safety
In the era of "brand safety" and the "adpocalypse," it became crucial for YouTube to strengthen its relationship with advertisers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. This shift transformed [[youtube_rewind_concept_and_evolution | YouTube Rewind]] into what is described as "a giant ad for YouTube" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. The video became a vehicle to highlight "advertiser-friendly things," "super clean [[creators_perspective_on_youtube_rewind | creators]]," and mainstream late-night show hosts, which advertisers would prefer their ads to be next to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

### Exclusions and Inclusions
This advertiser-centric approach led to the exclusion of popular but potentially "controversial" [[creators_perspective_on_youtube_rewind | YouTubers]] and major platform moments from [[criticism_of_youtube_rewind_2018 | YouTube Rewind 2018]], such as:
*   PewDiePie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>
*   Shane Dawson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>
*   The KSI vs. Logan Paul fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>

Conversely, figures not primarily known as [[creators_perspective_on_youtube_rewind | YouTubers]] or those not significantly prominent on the platform in 2018, like Will Smith, Trevor Noah, and John Oliver, were included, likely because they appeal more to advertisers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

> "YouTube rewind turned into this like hey check out all these advertiser friendly things for you to spend your money on all these super clean creators and these late-night show hosts and all these things that you want your ads next to you so that you want your ads next to you so YouTube rewind in a way just turned into a giant ad for YouTube that's the truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>

## Stylistic Changes and Overload
The style of [[youtube_rewind_concept_and_evolution | YouTube Rewind]] has also shifted, moving from simple formats like Rebecca Black counting down top videos in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a> to chaotic, fast-paced mashups in later years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. This "mash-up style" attempts to "shove everything into this video" in an effort to satisfy everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.

However, despite trying to include hundreds of elements, the clear exclusions for advertiser appeal make the omissions even more apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>. The ultimate problem is YouTube's attempt to appeal to advertisers by avoiding controversial content while simultaneously trying to include "hundreds of things" to make everyone happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>.

> "YouTube rewind's problem is it's trying to appeal to advertisers because that's what YouTube kind of feels like they have to do by excluding any even little bit of a controversial thing that happened in the last year but in the mash-up style they're still including hundreds of things every single little thing they can in an effort to try to make everyone happy but the more things you include the more obvious and well-defined those exclusions are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>

The conclusion is that YouTube cannot make everyone happy with this approach and might benefit from embracing selectivity, showcasing a few truly representative moments of the year, similar to earlier, more celebrated [[youtube_rewind_concept_and_evolution | YouTube Rewind]] editions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>.

The original Game Boy, released in April 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>, quickly became the most popular portable handheld gaming console ever, significantly altering the course of gaming history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. Its success was due in large part to its deliberate design philosophy and legendary durability.

## Design Philosophy

Upon first impression, the Game Boy is noted for its "thick console" and "big buttons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. Its design is considered "very friendly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a> and remarkably "well-designed" and "simple" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:15:00">[22:15:00]</a>, inspiring a sense of "Zen" with its clean, efficient, and minimalist aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:08:00">[22:08:00]</a>.

Nintendo, the company behind the Game Boy, which started as a card company in the 1800s before evolving into a technology company in the early 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>, adopted a philosophy of "lateral innovation by withered technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:12:00">[17:12:00]</a>. This meant they utilized tech that had been around for a few years and was mature enough to be well-understood and effectively implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20:00">[17:20:00]</a>.

This approach contrasted with competitors like Atari and Sega, whose systems featured flashier color screens and louder displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:00">[16:49:00]</a>. While these offered more visual appeal, they significantly compromised battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03:00">[17:03:00]</a>. The Game Boy's simpler design, with its monochromatic screen and basic "bloops and bleeps" audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:54:00">[17:54:00]</a>, allowed for extended playtime. The minimalist approach extended to its controls, featuring only a D-pad and two buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>. This design choice proved to be a "feature, not a bug" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:00">[21:51:00]</a>.

## Unparalleled Durability

The Game Boy is often referred to as a "brick" due to its robust build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>. It was designed in an era where people were concerned about nuclear weapons, and it was said to be able to survive anything "other than direct hit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.

A famous anecdote highlights this durability: a Game Boy is on display that "survived a Gulf War bombing" and is "still playing Tetris today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. It's often cited as "the single most indestructible piece of gaming equipment we've ever had" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.

### Flamethrower Durability Test

To test the Game Boy's famed toughness, Marques Brownlee and Casey Neistat conducted a flamethrower test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.

> "Okay, so there's a story of a Game Boy surviving a bombing in the Gulf War. And if it can survive that, I kinda just wanna know where that breaking point is 'cause I don't-- I feel like it doesn't get much worse than that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>.

After being subjected to direct flame, the Game Boy's exterior was "severely melted, charred" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>, and the buttons turned black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. The body melted more easily than the buttons, and the back softened, making it difficult to insert a game cartridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>.

Despite the severe external damage, when a cartridge was forced in, the Game Boy still powered on with its iconic chime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>. Amazingly, the screen under the protector remained functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.

> "It completely does everything that it did before it was literally blowtorched. It just smells a little worse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>.

The test concluded that the Game Boy was "undeniably built like a brick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>.

## Legacy and Impact

The Game Boy's design and durability contributed significantly to its "gigantic success," selling over 200 million units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:28:00">[22:28:00]</a>. It made millions of people into gamers and became a worldwide phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:35:00">[22:35:00]</a>.

The minimalist and pure design of the Game Boy has had a lasting impact on modern technology. Its legacy is seen as a direct precursor to devices like the [[Design and build quality of iPhone 6s | iPhone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:18:00">[21:18:00]</a> and the prevalence of smartphone gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:22:00">[21:22:00]</a>. The concept of having a device in one's pocket that knew how to entertain was pioneered by the Game Boy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:32:00">[21:32:00]</a>. The "simplicity and the purity of design" that reemerged with the first generation iPhone can be traced in a "straight line" from the Game Boy's inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:56:00">[21:56:00]</a>.

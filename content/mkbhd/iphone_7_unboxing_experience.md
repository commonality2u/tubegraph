## Jet Black [[contents_of_the_iphone_7_retail_box | iPhone 7]] Unboxing

The jet black [[contents_of_the_iphone_7_retail_box | iPhone 7]] comes in a rare black Apple box. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a> Upon opening, the phone is not immediately visible at the top. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a> Instead, paperwork titled "Designed by Apple in California" is presented first. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a> The jet black [[contents_of_the_iphone_7_retail_box | iPhone 7]] is noted for its super glossy appearance, which quickly shows fingerprints. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>

### Box Contents

The retail box includes:
*   EarPods with a Lightning connector. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>
*   A Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter (dongle). This adapter costs nine dollars if lost and is sold in the Apple Store. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>

## Matte Black [[contents_of_the_iphone_7_retail_box | iPhone 7]] Plus Unboxing

The unboxing experience for the matte black [[contents_of_the_iphone_7_retail_box | iPhone 7]] Plus is very similar inside to the jet black model. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a> The paperwork is at the top, followed by the phone. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a> The matte black finish is described as super clean and shows fingerprints, though not to the same extent as the glossy jet black version. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a> The larger [[contents_of_the_iphone_7_retail_box | iPhone 7]] Plus features dual cameras on the back. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>

Comparing it to a device like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, the [[contents_of_the_iphone_7_retail_box | iPhone 7]] Plus is still larger due to its more substantial bezels ("forehead" and "chin"). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>

## Initial Setup and Features (iOS 10)

The [[contents_of_the_iphone_7_retail_box | iPhone 7]] boots up running iOS 10. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a> A significant new feature is the capacitive home button, which does not physically move when the phone is off. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>

During setup, users are prompted to "Meet the new home button." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a> This pressure-sensitive button uses the taptic engine to provide haptic feedback. Users can choose from three levels of feedback intensity:
*   **3**: A very firm click response. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
*   **2**: The default, a middle ground. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>
*   **1**: A very light response, almost imperceptible. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>

The iOS 10 experience on the [[contents_of_the_iphone_7_retail_box | iPhone 7]] is noted as faster and smoother due to the new chip, compared to older models like the [[contents_of_the_iphone_7_retail_box | iPhone 6s]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>

## Performance

Geekbench 4 was run to assess the performance of the new A10 Fusion chip. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a> The [[contents_of_the_iphone_7_retail_box | iPhone 7]] Plus is confirmed to have 3 gigabytes of RAM, while the [[contents_of_the_iphone_7_retail_box | iPhone 7]] has 2 gigabytes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a> The Geekbench 4 scores are impressive, particularly the multi-core score, which was noted to be higher than devices using the Snapdragon 820. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>

## Color Comparison and Recommendation

Between the two colors, the matte black is suggested as the "safe route." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a> The jet black is described as almost a "special edition phone" and is highly susceptible to fingerprints and scratches. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a> It is recommended to view the jet black finish in person at a store to see these characteristics firsthand. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>

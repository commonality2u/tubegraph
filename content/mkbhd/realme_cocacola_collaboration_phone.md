It was reviewed as part of a challenge where the reviewer said "yes" to everything sent to their inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

## Unboxing Experience
The phone arrived in an "absurd looking box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:30">[07:53:30]</a> and also included a "real me cat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:81">[08:14:81]</a> and a sticker pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:04">[08:42:04]</a>.

## Technical Specifications
The base model for this collaboration is the realme 10 Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:94">[08:16:94]</a>, which is described as a "pretty good phone" and a "nice budget phone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:07">[08:19:07]</a>. Its specifications include:
*   Snapdragon 695 processor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:94">[08:20:94]</a>
*   120Hz display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:04">[08:22:04]</a>

## Coca-Cola Integration
This is not just a normal realme 10 Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:44">[08:28:44]</a>; it is the "half Coca-Cola realme 10 Pro" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:04">[08:31:04]</a>. The branding is extensive:
*   The phone features a "Coca-Cola gigantic" logo across its back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:14">[08:52:14]</a>, effectively making the user a "billboard" for the brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:24">[09:01:24]</a>.
*   The included wallpaper is Coca-Cola themed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:59">[09:09:59]</a>.
*   The icon packs are also Coca-Cola branded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:89">[09:12:89]</a>.
*   The phone's sounds, including touch sounds and ringtones, are "Coca-Cola bottle sounds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:49">[09:14:49]</a>.

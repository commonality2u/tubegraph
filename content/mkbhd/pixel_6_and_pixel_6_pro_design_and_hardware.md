The Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro mark a significant departure from previous Google Pixel phones, which often featured "pretty lackluster hardware" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a> despite their strong camera and software features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This generation is considered Google's "moon shot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, aiming to compete with other major flagships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. They represent "the most Google phones ever made" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a> and are described as the reviewer's "favorite Pixels ever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Design Language and Aesthetics

The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro introduce a "big new camera array" and a distinct "new design language" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### The Camera Bar (Visor)
The most striking design element is the "camera bar" or "visor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
- **Polarizing but Recognizable**: While some find it polarizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, it makes the phones "very easily recognizable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a> and allows Google to maintain this distinct "pixel phone look" for several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
- **Functional Aspect**: The design accommodates the "huge new camera sensors" that require significant thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Despite this, other phones like the Vivo X70 Pro Plus use the same 50-megapixel sensor with a more traditional camera rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
- **Ergonomics**: The bar is functional, with the index finger naturally resting "nicely underneath the camera bar" when held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. It also prevents the phone from rocking on a table when typing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
- **Integration Issues**: A minor flaw noted is that the camera bar does not "blend nicely into the aluminum sides" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, featuring "a lot of seams all over this camera module" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This contrasts with seamless designs like that of the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
- **Case Compatibility**: For those who dislike the bump, a case can "cancel the bump anyway" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, resulting in a flat and even phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a> while still maintaining the Pixel's recognizable visor design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Size and Form Factor
Both phones are large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Google's rationale for not offering a smaller model is that many users who prefer lower-priced phones still desire a large screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Hardware Features

### Buttons and Haptics
Both phones feature "clicky buttons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a> and "really good haptics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>, which is a characteristic Pixel trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### Water Resistance
The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro are "fully water resistant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### Fingerprint Reader
The in-display fingerprint reader on both phones is an optical sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, which is noted as "kind of slow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a> compared to the newer ultrasonic sensors used by Samsung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. It can take "a full like half second at least" to read a finger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, which can be annoying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Physical Differences Between Models
The Pixel 6 Pro justifies its higher price point with several hardware enhancements over the Pixel 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>:
- **Display**: The Pro features a 120Hz refresh rate (vs. 90Hz), 1440p resolution (vs. 1080p), and a curved screen (vs. flat) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.
- **Build Material**: The Pixel 6 Pro has glossy sides, whereas the Pixel 6 features matte sides, which the reviewer prefers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.
- **Cameras**: The Pro includes an additional 4x telephoto camera on the rear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a> and a wider, 11-megapixel selfie camera on the front (vs. 8-megapixel on the Pixel 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>.
- **Internal Specs**: The Pro also has "a little more RAM" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.

Overall, the hardware on the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro, particularly the design and the camera system, marks a significant "step up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a> for Google, allowing them to truly "compete with the big dogs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

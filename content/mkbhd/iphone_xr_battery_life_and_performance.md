The iPhone XR, also known as the iPhone 10R in this review, was launched in November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Despite having a certain reputation, this review aims to assess its true capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. It shares many similarities with the iPhone 10s in terms of design and new components, but key differences contribute to its $250 lower price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Display and Its Impact

The display is the most significant difference and a primary reason for the iPhone XR's lower cost and reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
It features a 6.1-inch "Liquid Retina Display," which is an LCD panel with curved corners, a resolution of 1792x828, and slightly thicker bezels than the iPhone 10s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. While the panel offers good color, brightness, and viewing angles, and is generally crisp for regular use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, its pixel density is 326 pixels per inch (PPI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. This is the same PPI as the iPhone 8 and iPhone 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The most consistently noticeable difference in practice, however, are the slightly thicker bezels compared to the iPhone 10s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

The choice of a lower-resolution display has direct implications for the phone's RAM and battery performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## Performance

The iPhone XR comes with 3GB of RAM, one gigabyte less than the iPhone 10s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This amount of RAM is sufficient for iOS, especially since it processes fewer pixels due to the lower resolution display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. iOS's efficient RAM management also contributes to smooth performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

The phone is powered by the A12 Bionic chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. The A12 Bionic is highly powerful, and because it needs to push fewer pixels on the lower-resolution display, it contributes significantly to the iPhone XR's excellent battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

## Battery Life

The iPhone XR is equipped with a 2942 mAh battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Its battery life is "excellent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, performing as well as, and sometimes even better than, the iPhone 10s Max <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. This robust battery performance is considered one of the best aspects of the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. While an all-day battery life is expected for a phone of this size, the iPhone XR's performance exceeded expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## Conclusion

The iPhone XR is not considered a budget phone, starting at $750 for 64GB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. However, it offers a much better value than the iPhone 10s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. While the display and camera might be seen as downsides when compared directly to the iPhone 10s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, for users upgrading from older models like the iPhone 8 or iPhone 7, the iPhone XR represents an upgrade in "pretty much every possible way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Considering the iPhone 8 started at $700, the iPhone XR's $750 starting price makes it a compelling option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. It is recommended as the "best seller iPhone for everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

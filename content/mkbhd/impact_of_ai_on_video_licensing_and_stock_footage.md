The rapid [[Advancements in AI generated videos | advancements in AI generated videos]] have brought forth powerful new tools like OpenAI's Sora, which are poised to significantly impact the video licensing and stock footage industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This new era of AI-created content raises both excitement for new possibilities and concerns for existing creative professions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## OpenAI's Sora: A Leap in AI Video Generation

Developed by Sam Altman and OpenAI, Sora is a new AI model capable of generating full video clips up to one minute in length from simple text input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Similar to DALL.E's ability to translate text into photorealistic images, Sora understands text prompts to create dynamic scenes, grasping how elements like reflections, textures, materials, and physics interact over time to produce a "reasonable looking video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

The progress is striking; in just one year, AI-generated videos have moved from rudimentary images like "Will Smith eating spaghetti" to highly sophisticated and realistic footage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Current State of AI-Generated Video: Realism and Imperfections

While not perfect, the quality of videos generated by Sora is already very impressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Examples provided by OpenAI demonstrate accurate lighting, materials, skin tones, movements, and reflections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

Some examples include:
*   A stylish woman walking down a Tokyo street with glowing neon and animated signage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   A camera following a vintage SUV speeding up a steep dirt road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   Golden retriever puppies playing in the snow, exhibiting realistic fur physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   A young man sitting on a cloud reading a book, featuring impressive lighting, shadows, and fabric realism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   A movie trailer featuring a spaceman in a salt desert, complete with film grain and cinematic style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

Despite these advancements, imperfections remain. Users might spot gliding characters, inconsistent frame rates, or odd reflections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. AI models can struggle with details like realistic hands, physics (e.g., wind on candles), or objects appearing out of nowhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. However, it's crucial to remember that this represents the *worst* the technology will be from now on, given its rapid improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

> [!tip] Watch out for imperfections
> When viewing [[Advancements in AI generated videos | AI generated content]], trained observers can often find imperfections. However, many online viewers may not be actively looking for such flaws, making it easier for AI-generated content to pass as real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Direct Impact on Stock Footage and Licensing

One of the most immediate and significant [[Implications of AI technology on video creation | implications of AI technology on video creation]] is on the stock footage industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. AI-generated videos are already good enough to be indistinguishable from real footage for purposes like presentations, advertisements, and PowerPoints that require "oddly specific stock videos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

For example:
*   A high-quality drone shot of waves at Big Sur could easily pass as real footage on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   A wall of vintage TVs, which would be expensive and difficult to shoot, can be generated with realistic reflections and environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   Historical footage, such as California during the Gold Rush, can be convincingly created to serve as an opening scene for an old Western <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

This capability implies a "dent out of video licensing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Why would someone pay to license footage of a house on cliffs when they can generate it for free or for a small subscription? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a> This could reduce the need to hire drone pilots, photographers, and videographers, as their licensed footage may no longer be required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Broader Implications for Video Creation

The rapid improvement of AI video generation tools like Sora also points to broader [[Implications of AI technology on video creation | implications of AI technology on video creation]] for the entire video industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. The question arises: how long until entire advertisements, YouTube videos, or even movies are completely generated with AI? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>

> The ability of AI-generated videos to pass as real footage raises significant [[Ethical and societal concerns of AI generated content | ethical and societal concerns of AI generated content]], especially during election years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. OpenAI has stated it will include a watermark in the bottom corner of every video generated by Sora as an indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Developers will need to be careful with safety measures, likely preventing the generation of people's likenesses or the creation of false depictions of public figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

Currently, Sora is in "super limited access," primarily in the hands of "red teamers" (testers pushing its limits) and a few trusted creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. The model is trained on videos made by humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>, leading to an open question about AI's potential for true innovation and creativity beyond human precedent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

The speed at which these [[Software and AI capabilities | software and AI capabilities]] are improving is truly shocking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The advancements seen in a single year suggest that current limitations will likely be overcome rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

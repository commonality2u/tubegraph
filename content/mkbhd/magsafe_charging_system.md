MagSafe is an optional new magnetic charging accessory standard featured on the back of the new iPhones, specifically located behind the Apple logo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. It is considered possibly the biggest external hardware feature of the new iPhones and has significant implications for the future of the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## MagSafe Charger Puck
The primary [[magsafe_technology_and_accessories | MagSafe]] accessory offered by Apple is the puck charger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Power and Compatibility**: The [[magsafe_technology_and_accessories | MagSafe]] puck charger charges at 15 watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, while other wireless chargers for the iPhone still operate at 7.5 watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. It functions by attaching to the back of the phone, aligning with the magnets over the Apple logo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. It does not include a charging brick, requiring users to supply a USB-C charging brick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Qi Charging**: The [[battery_life_and_charging | iPhone 12]] is still compatible with [[battery_life_and_charging | Qi charging]], meaning it can be charged with other wireless chargers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The [[magsafe_technology_and_accessories | MagSafe]] puck can also be used to charge other phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Case Compatibility**: [[battery_life_and_charging | MagSafe charging]] is possible through most non-[[magsafe_technology_and_accessories | MagSafe]] cases, provided they are thin enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. The magnet's functionality extends through some thin cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, as demonstrated with a Dbrand grip case which was confirmed to be thin enough for the [[magsafe_technology_and_accessories | MagSafe]] charger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Durability and Marks**: There were concerns about [[magsafe_technology_and_accessories | MagSafe]] potentially leaving marks on the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. While such marks have been observed, they appear to wipe off and are not expected to be a long-term problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Implications for the Future of iPhone
[[magsafe_technology_and_accessories | MagSafe]] is currently optional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>, but it signals Apple's gradual progression towards a portless iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. The expectation is that [[magsafe_technology_and_accessories | MagSafe]] will become the primary solution for conveniently charging a phone without a port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. While "not amazing," its functionality is considered "fine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

### MagSafe Accessories
Apple has introduced several [[magsafe_technology_and_accessories | MagSafe]] accessories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>:
*   **Cases**: A regular case and a transparent clear version are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Wallet**: A wallet accessory was also released, though its magnets are not very strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This wallet could be a strategic move to address future charging issues for users of wallet cases, allowing the wallet to be removed for wireless charging when the iPhone becomes portless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

Overall, [[magsafe_technology_and_accessories | MagSafe]] is an "awesome improvement" to the iPhone's build quality and design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>, and users should get used to it as it might become a standard charging method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

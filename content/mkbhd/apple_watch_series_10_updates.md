## Design and Display Improvements
The Series 10 is 10% thinner and 10% lighter than previous models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. It features a slightly larger display with thinner bezels and improved viewing angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Apple has incorporated a "wide angle OLED display" to enhance screen visibility from various angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. The engineering includes combining the metal backplate and charger into one piece with integrated antennas to improve thinness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

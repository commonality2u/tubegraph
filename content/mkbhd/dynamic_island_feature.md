The [[dynamic_island_and_its_functionality | Dynamic Island]] feature was introduced with the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max models at Apple's September 2022 event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>. Initially, the name prompted laughter from the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. However, upon explanation and use, the feature was found to be intuitive and impressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>.

## [[design_and_features | Design and Functionality]]

The core idea behind the [[dynamic_island_and_its_functionality | Dynamic Island]] involves shrinking the selfie camera and Face ID system components by approximately 30%, allowing them to fit into a pill-shaped cutout at the top of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>. This would typically be a minor aesthetic update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>.

Apple, however, leveraged the OLED display's ability to render pixels pitch black to dynamically extend the edges of this pill-shaped cutout with user interface (UI) elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. This creates a fluid, animated space that responds to ongoing notifications and live activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>.

### Key Interactions:
*   **Live Activities:** The [[dynamic_island_and_its_functionality | Dynamic Island]] displays live actions such as music playback, timers, or ride-sharing notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.
*   **Animations:** It features smooth animations that expand, shrink, and move around the cutout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.
*   **App Interaction:** Users can tap on the icon within the [[dynamic_island_and_its_functionality | Dynamic Island]] to open the associated app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.
*   **Contextual Information:** Holding down on the [[dynamic_island_and_its_functionality | Dynamic Island]] surfaces extra information, similar to a widget, without needing to pull down notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>.

## Integration and User Experience

The feature works seamlessly with a variety of stock Apple applications, including Apple Maps, the Timer, and Voicemails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. Apple has stated that it will also support third-party applications, although implementation speed will depend on developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

One notable aspect of the [[dynamic_island_and_its_functionality | Dynamic Island]] is its multitasking capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>. If multiple background activities are occurring simultaneously—like a timer, Maps navigation, and music playing—the [[dynamic_island_and_its_functionality | Dynamic Island]] can transform into a compact multitasking UI, allowing users to quickly switch between these ongoing tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>.

The responsiveness of the [[dynamic_island_and_its_functionality | Dynamic Island]] is high; even if a user's finger slightly misses the camera cutout itself, the surrounding pixels at the top and bottom of the cutout are responsive to touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>. There are also active pixels within the cutout that respond to touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.

While the cutout might look "a little worse" during full-screen videos or games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>, its overall usefulness is intended to compensate for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>. The [[dynamic_island_and_its_functionality | Dynamic Island]] is described as a "next-level upgrade" that is thoughtful, playful, friendly, and intuitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>. It is anticipated that many users will appreciate this new feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>.

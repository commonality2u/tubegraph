The Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro mark a significant shift for Google, introducing their custom-designed Tensor chip as a foundational element [00:00:42] [00:05:22]. This chip, designed specifically for these phones, aims to enable capabilities not possible with off-the-shelf Qualcomm chips, particularly in areas like machine learning, AI, and computational photography [00:05:30] [00:05:33] [00:05:38] [00:05:46].

## Benchmark Performance

While raw benchmarks aren't the primary focus for the Tensor chip, curious tests were performed:
*   **Geekbench**: The Pixel 6 Pro scored 1035 on single-core and 2800 on multi-core [00:05:58]. This places its CPU performance roughly 8% to 10% slower on paper than the Snapdragon 888, but significantly ahead of the Snapdragon 765G used in the Pixel 5 [00:06:03] [00:06:07] [00:06:09].
*   **3DMark (GPU)**: The Tensor chip showed GPU performance 10% to 12% faster than the Snapdragon 888 [00:10:17] [00:06:20].

However, these benchmarks don't fully capture the chip's capabilities, as Tensor is designed to make the Pixel a "Googly phone" by focusing on real-world features powered by AI and machine learning [00:06:22] [00:06:26] [00:06:29].

## Real-World Performance and AI Features

The Tensor chip allows the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro to be "the smartest smartphone to come out every year" [00:06:51]. The phones are generally quick and responsive, with the Pixel 6 Pro benefiting from an adaptive refresh rate of up to 120Hz [00:06:35] [00:06:37] [00:06:41].

Tensor enhances existing Pixel features and introduces new ones:
*   **Call Screening**: Google Assistant can filter incoming calls [00:06:56] [00:06:58].
*   **Now Playing**: Ambiently detects and lists songs playing in the background [00:07:02] [00:07:04].
*   **Live Captioning**: Provides real-time captions for videos, phone calls, and movies [00:07:12] [00:07:14].
*   **Speech-to-Text**: This feature is notably improved, allowing for fast and accurate transcription, even at high speech rates (e.g., 200 words per minute) [00:07:27] [00:07:29] [00:07:40] [00:07:42]. It also automatically adds accurate punctuation and can learn corrected spellings for names [00:07:48] [00:07:50] [00:08:03] [00:08:09]. Voice commands like "delete this" or "send" are understood and executed [00:08:17] [00:08:19].
*   **[[Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro camera capabilities and features | Magic Eraser]]**: A new feature in Google Photos that allows users to easily remove unwanted objects or people from images by automatically selecting them or by drawing a sloppy outline [00:08:25] [00:08:28] [00:08:42] [00:08:45] [00:08:56]. It works best with simple backgrounds and good contrast, but struggles with complex scenes [00:09:12] [00:09:15] [00:09:22] [00:09:25]. This feature showcases the powerful AI capabilities of Tensor [00:09:38].
*   **[[Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro camera capabilities and features | Camera Viewfinder and Processing]]**: Tensor's horsepower allows the camera viewfinder to display a high ISO, noisy preview to maintain a high frame rate and shutter speed [00:18:50] [00:18:53] [00:18:55]. This ensures a smooth preview, and then the powerful processing turns it into a sharp, clear final photo [00:18:46] [00:19:01].
*   **[[Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro camera capabilities and features | Face Unblur]]**: The Tensor chip enables the ultrawide camera to run at a higher shutter speed. If the primary camera captures a blurry face due to movement, the chip can merge in a sharper face from the ultrawide camera into the final shot automatically [00:19:10] [00:19:12] [00:19:16] [00:19:18] [00:19:21] [00:19:27].

## [[Battery life and charging on Pixel 6 and 6 Pro | Battery Life]]

Despite the custom-designed chip, [[Battery life and charging on Pixel 6 and 6 Pro | battery life]] on the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro is considered average at best [00:10:21] [00:10:33]. Expectations for significant improvements were high due to [[Performance of iPhone 7 with A10 Fusion chip | Apple's silicon efficiency]] [00:09:51] [00:09:53]. The Pixel 6 Pro, with its 5000mAh battery, consistently yielded only three and a half to four and a half hours of screen-on time, with slightly less on the Pixel 6 (4600mAh battery) [00:10:13] [00:10:16] [00:10:24] [00:10:26]. This is considered a weakness for a flagship phone [00:10:45].

## Conclusion

The Tensor chip is a core part of Google's "moon shot" with the Pixel 6 series, allowing them to compete with other flagship devices [00:00:46] [00:01:29]. While it brings significant advancements in AI-driven features and computational photography, making the Pixel the "most Google phones ever made" [00:00:53] [00:06:26], there are still areas like [[Battery life and charging on Pixel 6 and 6 Pro | battery life]] and [[Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro camera capabilities and features | camera processing consistency]] that could see further optimization through software updates [00:19:56].

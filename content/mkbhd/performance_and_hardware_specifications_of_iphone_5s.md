The iPhone 5s, reviewed from the perspective of a long-term user who utilizes many Google services, offers insights beyond typical initial tech reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Hardware Specifications
The iPhone 5s, released a couple of weeks prior to the review, features a dual-core 1.3 gigahertz chip, 1 gigabyte of RAM, 32 gigabytes of storage, an 8-megapixel camera, and a 1570 milliamp-hour battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. On paper, these specifications were noted to be similar to a 2011 flagship like the Samsung Galaxy S2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. The main internal change from the iPhone 5 to the 5s was in its internal hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

### Processor and Architecture
The device incorporates Apple's new chip and a 64-bit architecture, which provides "future-proofness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

## Performance
Performance throughout iOS 7 on the iPhone 5s is described as "pretty snappy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. It performs comparably to contemporary flagship devices that feature 8-core chips, double the RAM, and 20-megapixel cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. iOS has historically required fewer resources to run smoothly, multitask efficiently, and maintain battery life, so the speed of the iPhone 5s, especially compared to older iPhones, is not surprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Overall, the [[Performance of iPhone 7 with A10 Fusion chip | iPhone 5s]] offers great performance with smooth animations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

## Hardware Design and Build
The [[iphone_5s_design_and_build_quality | iPhone 5s design and build quality]] is described as very well-crafted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. It features solid aluminum on the sides and back, with precisely crafted buttons that do not wobble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. The buttons also have laser etchings for volume indication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. The chamfered edges are angled slightly inwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. The headphone jack and Lightning port are located on the bottom, alongside precisely milled speaker grille holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. The device is lightweight and easy to hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

Despite its solid build and premium materials (metal, glass back), the [[iphone_5s_design_and_build_quality | iPhone 5s]] can feel delicate due to its lack of curves and glass back, leading to a perception of fragility and a desire to use a case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The device is described as "extremely well built," but its design makes it feel vulnerable to scratches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

### Display
The iPhone 5s features a 4-inch display, making it the smallest display among flagship phones at its release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The reviewer appreciates the quality of the display but wishes it were larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

### Speakers
The speakers on the bottom of the iPhone 5s appear to be stereo with two grilles, but only a single driver on the right-hand side produces sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Covering the left grille results in no change in sound, while covering the right grille completely mutes the audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

## Battery
The [[battery_life_and_charging_speed_of_iphone_5s | iPhone 5s]] has a 1570 milliamp-hour battery, which is relatively small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This size is roughly half that of a Samsung Galaxy Note 3's battery (over 3000 mAh) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

*   **Charging Speed**: A significant pro of the smaller battery is that it charges very quickly, described as "lightning fast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Standby Time**: Standby times on the iPhone 5s are excellent; a device at 100% battery before sleep might only drop to 97% by morning, outperforming Android devices with similar battery sizes which might drop to 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. iOS effectively manages background processes during sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Active Use Battery Life**: During active use, the [[battery_life_and_charging_speed_of_iphone_5s | iPhone 5s]] does not offer the best battery life compared to other smartphones with larger batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Its battery life is noted to be slightly worse, maybe 5% worse, than the iPhone 5, but generally consistent with expectations for an iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Users upgrading from a previous generation iPhone will find the battery life familiar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

## Camera
The [[camera_quality_and_features_of_iphone_5s | iPhone 5s camera]] experience is balanced between quality and control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. It scores around an 8 out of 10 for quality and an 8 out of 10 for control (due to its ease of use) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

The camera is characterized as "very fast" in several ways:
*   Quick to take photos and process shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   Fast HDR processing, allowing for moving subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   A fast, wide aperture (F 2.0 or 2.2), which is great for low-light conditions, although it can be slightly softer than the iPhone 5's aperture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   Fast video modes, including 120 frames per second video that can be slowed to 30 frames per second for smooth slow-motion effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

The most enjoyable aspect of shooting with the [[camera_quality_and_features_of_iphone_5s | iPhone 5s camera]] was its low-light capabilities; it can "essentially see in the dark" where many other camera phones fall short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Photos taken are generally solid, with very accurate and colorful rendering, and most detail preserved, despite being slightly softer than the iPhone 5 due to the wider aperture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Overall, in terms of photo and video quality and control, the [[camera_quality_and_features_of_iphone_5s | iPhone 5s camera]] is among the best in smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

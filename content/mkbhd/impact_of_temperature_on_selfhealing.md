The [[lg_g_flex_selfhealing_technology | LG G Flex self-healing technology]] has two main aspects: its durable backing material and its curved, flexible design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. The self-healing capability of the backing material, specifically, is influenced by environmental temperature.

## LG's Optimal Conditions

LG's official YouTube video showcasing the self-healing feature used "optimal controlled conditions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:09">[02:07:09]</a> for their experiment. These conditions included an air temperature of 27.4 degrees Celsius (81 degrees Fahrenheit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>, which is described as the equivalent of a "very warm summer day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. Under these conditions, the G Flex was shown to "completely heal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a> scratches after two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

## Real-World Testing and Temperature Differences

In a real-world test conducted in New York City, the ambient temperature was significantly colder, around 13 degrees Celsius (55 degrees Fahrenheit) on a "nice day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. When the phone was subjected to scratches from keys, simulating everyday pocket wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, the scratches were "mostly minimized," though "not completely gone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>, after a few minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. This suggests that without the optimal warm conditions, the healing process might be less complete or slower.

## Accelerating Healing with Heat

It is possible to "accelerate the healing process a little bit by warming up the device" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. Methods to do this include:
*   Rubbing against the scratches "really fast for a bit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.
*   Clutching the phone to your body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   Playing intensive games to generate heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

## Limitations with Deep Scratches

Even with attempts to warm the device, a deep scratch made by a knife was only "about halfway gone" and "barely noticeable now" after a few hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. While this is still considered "way better than any other traditional phone material" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>, it indicates that deeper damage may not fully disappear and can take a considerable amount of time to minimize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

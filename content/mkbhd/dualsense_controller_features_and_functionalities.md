The [[dualsense_controller_features_and_design | DualSense controller]] is a key component of the PlayStation 5's next-generation experience, introducing significant advancements over previous controllers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>.

## Design and Ergonomics
The [[dualsense_controller_features_and_design | DualSense controller]] shares the [[playstation_5_design_and_aesthetics | black and white motif]] seen throughout the PlayStation 5 console and its [[playstation_5_accessories_overview | official accessories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. It is notably "sweet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>, being larger and slightly heavier in the hands compared to its predecessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. It features "quality buttons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a> and utilizes USB-C for charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

## Battery Life
The battery life of the [[dualsense_controller_features_and_design | DualSense controller]] is considered "pretty good", providing about two full days of intensive gaming, which is comparable to the PS4 controller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

## Next-Gen Sensory Feedback

The most significant "next-gen feeling" aspects of the [[dualsense_controller_features_and_design | DualSense controller]] are its improved haptics and adaptive triggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

### Haptic Feedback
The [[dualsense_controller_features_and_design | DualSense controller]] features "massively improved haptics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a> that aim to provide a more immersive sensory experience. For example, in *Astro's Playroom*, the haptics can make sand feel like sand and ice feel like ice through the player's hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

### Adaptive Triggers
The adaptive triggers on the [[dualsense_controller_features_and_design | DualSense controller]] introduce variable resistance, making it "difficult to squeeze" when necessary, such as when compressing a spring, adding a realistic sense of "resistance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. This feature is considered even more immersive than the haptics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

#### Game Implementation Examples:
*   **Astro's Playroom**: This game serves as the "best demo" for the new [[dualsense_controller_features_and_design | DualSense controller]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. It showcases how the haptics and adaptive triggers enhance exploration and interaction with the game environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   **NBA 2K21**: In *NBA 2K21*, the adaptive triggers dynamically adjust resistance based on player fatigue. When a player is tired, the sprint trigger becomes harder to pull down, providing tactile feedback on character stamina without needing to look at the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. This is described as a "great use" of the feature that enhances the "next-gen" feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   **Spider-Man: Miles Morales**: To some disappointment, this launch title did not extensively utilize the haptics or adaptive triggers. There were no specific tactile sensations for climbing different surfaces or increased trigger resistance for web-slinging maneuvers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. The game primarily used occasional standard vibrations for actions like punching or throwing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
*   **Older Titles and [[performance_features_and_driving_experience | Driving Games]]**: When playing backwards compatible PS4 games like *FIFA*, *Need for Speed*, and *Dirt*, the [[dualsense_controller_features_and_design | DualSense controller]] reverts to "normal tiny vibrations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. Even in [[performance_features_and_driving_experience | driving games]], where one might expect extensive feedback from different surfaces and collisions, the advanced haptics and adaptive triggers were not utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

### Developer Adoption
There is a perception that developers might be "tentative to overuse" the advanced [[dualsense_controller_features_and_design | DualSense controller]] features, possibly fearing that excessive implementation could lead players to disable vibrations entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Despite this, the triggers are still considered "great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>, and there is anticipation for how the controller will be implemented in future games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

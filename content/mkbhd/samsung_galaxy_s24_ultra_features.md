The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra is positioned as a leading Android slab phone for 2024, aiming to integrate the best aspects from other high-end smartphones and maximize every valued feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Evolution of Samsung's Ultra Phones

Initially, Samsung's Ultra phones focused on raw numbers, such as high megapixel counts and maximum zoom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Later, the S Pen was incorporated, refining the line and effectively replacing the Note series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The S24 Ultra represents a culmination, offering top-tier hardware and software in a single device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Design and Physical Features

While outwardly similar to its predecessor, the S24 Ultra boasts several key design refinements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. It features a completely flat display brought right to the corners, alongside some of the thinnest bezels observed to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. The phone also incorporates a new anti-reflective coating on its Gorilla Glass Armor, which notably reduces reflections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. An ultra-fast ultrasonic fingerprint reader is integrated underneath the display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The S24 Ultra sports a new titanium color and titanium rails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. Its flattened screen, sides, and boxier corners are consistent across the lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. Haptics on the device are noted as being very good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

## Display Technology and Specifications

The S24 Ultra features a class-leading 6.8-inch Quad HD AMOLED display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. It maintains a 120Hz LTPO refresh rate and sharp Quad HD resolution, which have been hallmarks of Ultra phones for some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. New enhancements include its completely flat design and significantly increased brightness, reaching a maximum of 2,600 nits, making it excellent for outdoor use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The display can also get extremely dim at night without exhibiting unusual banding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Battery Life

The S24 Ultra retains a 5,000mAh battery, maintaining its status as one of the best-performing battery phones despite being thinner and including the S Pen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. It supports 45W wired charging and 25W wireless charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Users can expect long days with over six hours of screen-on time, and with careful use, it can last two full days, even at 1440p resolution, 120Hz, and high brightness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Performance

The phone is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, offering excellent high-end performance and efficiency gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Paired with 12GB of RAM, it excels as a multitasking champion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. The S Pen remains the only high-end stylus available in slab smartphones, useful for note-taking, drawing, and highlighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. For gaming and everyday use, the S24 Ultra includes newly added ray tracing and a 90% larger vapor chamber for improved cooling during extended sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Camera Capabilities

The S24 Ultra's camera system is comprehensive in terms of utility and technical specifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. It features four cameras on the back, largely consistent with the S23 Ultra, with one significant change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. The array includes a primary camera, an ultrawide, and two telephoto cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

### Camera Hardware and Performance
*   **Primary Camera**: A 200-megapixel sensor offering consistent and versatile performance with great dynamic range, quick shooting, and fast autofocus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. It typically bins down to 12 megapixels, with the 200-megapixel mode best reserved for exceptional lighting conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Ultrawide Camera**: Provides a meaningfully wider field of view than the primary camera, despite some distortion near the edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. The automatic macro mode from this lens is advised to be turned off due to poor quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **3X Telephoto Camera**: A medium-range telephoto that integrates smoothly, matching colors and exposure with the main camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **5X Telephoto Camera**: A new 50-megapixel 5X telephoto camera replaces the previous 10-megapixel 10X camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. While optically shorter, its higher resolution makes it more powerful, resulting in sharper photos between 5X and 10X zoom compared to the S23 Ultra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. The new 5X cropped in can even outperform the S23 Ultra's 10X photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. The phone can still zoom up to 100X for stable shots of distant objects like the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

### Image Processing and Features
Samsung's photos tend to have a slightly processed look, with extra contrast, higher exposure, and brighter colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. The S24 Ultra captures everything in HDR by default, using Google's new Ultra HDR format. This feature tastefully enhances specular highlights and dynamic range for a more dramatic appearance on screen, similar to Pixel and iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. This HDR capability extends from capture to gallery viewing and even to social media uploads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Samsung has partnered with Instagram and Snapchat to provide native quality photo and video uploading pipelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

## Software and AI Features

The S24 Ultra is equipped with numerous helpful AI features, many developed in partnership with Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. These AI capabilities are primarily found under the "Advanced Intelligence" section in settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

### AI-Powered Photo Editing
*   **Remaster**: A button in the Gallery app that adds contrast and brightens photos as needed, offering a before-and-after view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   **Erase Reflections**: For photos with glass or windows, this feature allows users to circle reflections to be removed, with generative fill replacing the content behind the glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **Add Background Blur**: If a subject is detected in a non-portrait mode photo, the phone can analyze the subject and add background blur to create a portrait mode effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Magic Editor**: Similar to the Pixel's Magic Editor but without apparent restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
    *   Allows moving subjects within a photo, with generative AI filling in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
    *   Can remove foreground or background objects like photobombers or unnecessary items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
    *   Enables tilting the horizon of a photo without cropping, with generative AI filling in the newly exposed edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   These editing features work on any photo downloaded to the phone, not just those taken by the camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
*   Photos altered with Magic Editor receive a small star watermark in the corner, indicating AI manipulation, though this watermark can be removed using the built-in object removal tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

*   **Samsung Browser Summaries**: The browser can now summarize webpages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.
*   **Circle to Search**: An enhanced version of Google Lens, activated by holding down the home button or gesture bar. Users can circle or tap any item on the screen to perform an immediate Google search without leaving the current app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. It works for pictures, parts of pictures, objects via the camera viewfinder, landmarks, and text, with the ability to append text to searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. The S Pen can offer more precise selections for this feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   **Software Updates**: Samsung promises seven years of security updates and seven generations of major software updates for the S24 lineup, extending support until 2031 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
*   **AI Generated Wallpapers**: A section dedicated to AI-generated wallpapers is included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.
*   **Always On Display**: A new always-on display shows the entire wallpaper, similar to the iPhone's implementation. This can be turned off to conserve battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.
*   **Object Selection and Sticker Creation**: Long-pressing an object in a photo automatically cuts it out, turning it into a sticker for use in other apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.
*   **Lock Screen Widgets**: New lock screen widgets are available, mirroring those found on [[iphone_12_pro_features | iPhones]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

## Overall Impression and Value Proposition

The S24 Ultra is described as "peak slab phone," offering reliability, speed, and comprehensive functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. Its high price point of $1,300 is noted as the main deterrent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. For those seeking a more affordable option, Samsung's own lineup offers alternatives like the S24 Plus, which has a 4,900mAh battery, a 6.7-inch display, and omits the S Pen and one telephoto camera for $300 less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. The regular S24 also provides significant value for a lower price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. However, for users willing to spend for the absolute maximum features and capabilities in a slab phone, the S24 Ultra is presented as the top choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

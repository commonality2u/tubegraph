The Samsung Galaxy Fold is packaged with a protective case designed to safeguard the device [01:06:01].

## Included Case Features
The included case for the Galaxy Fold is a two-piece design, which is a practical approach for a foldable phone [01:03:02]. It is made of a Kevlar-like flexible material [01:05:07]. This design avoids covering the phone's hinge and has no moving parts [01:08:08]. The case features adhesive on the inside for attachment, though it is not strictly necessary to use the adhesive for installation [01:10:07]. The case can be easily installed and removed [01:17:09].

When the case is on, the phone receives additional protection, but its appearance may become "uglier," similar to other phone cases [01:21:03]. Any case manufactured for the [[Samsung Galaxy Fold features and design | Galaxy Fold]] will either need to be foldable itself or come in two separate pieces [01:57:08].

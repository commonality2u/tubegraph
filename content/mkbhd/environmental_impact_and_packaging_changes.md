The iPhone 13 lineup features notable changes to its packaging, primarily aimed at reducing its environmental footprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37"></a>.

## Packaging Design
The packaging for the iPhone 13, 13 mini, 13 Pro, and 13 Pro Max is consistently thin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28"></a>. This design is due to the continued exclusion of a power brick from the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30"></a>. A significant change this year is the absence of plastic shrink wrap around the boxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32"></a>.

The Pro iPhones, specifically the 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max, are presented in black boxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31"></a>.

## Environmental Considerations
Apple has been credited for its efforts in using recycled materials to offset its [[new_iphone_packaging_and_environmental_impact | environmental impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37"></a>. The packaging itself is made from recycled box cardboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42"></a>. Beyond the packaging, the devices incorporate recycled aluminum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45"></a> and feature a recycled phone design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45"></a>.

## Box Contents
Despite the different models, the contents inside the boxes are very similar across the iPhone 13 lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12"></a>. Each box typically includes:
*   A Lightning to USB-C cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58"></a>
*   Some paperwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00"></a>
*   A SIM card tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01"></a>
*   A white Apple sticker (not colored) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46"></a>

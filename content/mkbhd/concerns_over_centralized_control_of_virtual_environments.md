The concept of the metaverse, a persistent shared virtual space, is a subject of significant investment and discussion, particularly from companies like [[meta_and_the_metaverse | Meta]]. However, this ambition raises concerns about the potential for a single entity to control the fundamental infrastructure of this emergent digital frontier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

## Meta's Strategy for Dominance

[[meta_and_the_metaverse | Meta]], formerly Facebook, has committed substantial resources to the metaverse, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg doubling down on this vision and pouring billions into its development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This commitment comes as [[meta_and_the_metaverse | Meta]]'s stock has significantly declined and Facebook's growth has flatlined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

Historically, the internet has been largely controlled by two forces: ads and devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Companies like Google control advertising by connecting people to products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, while device manufacturers like Apple control what content reaches users' eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. With the introduction of features like Apple's "ask app not to track" button, [[meta_and_the_metaverse | Meta]]'s advertising business faced a multi-billion dollar impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

Recognizing the decline of their previous internet dominance, [[meta_and_the_metaverse | Meta]] has shifted focus to [[virtual_reality_vr_and_augmented_reality_ar | virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)]] as the "next big thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Their strategy is to gain as much control as possible over this [[developments_and_future_expectations_for_vr_and_ar | VR future]], encompassing software, hardware, advertising, and the content users consume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This strategy aims to regain the control and revenue they seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

> [!INFO] Defining Key Terms
> *   **[[virtual_reality_vr_and_augmented_reality_ar | Virtual Reality (VR)]]**: Involves wearing a headset to be completely immersed in a virtual world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
> *   **[[virtual_reality_vr_and_augmented_reality_ar | Augmented Reality (AR)]]**: Overlays virtual elements onto the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

[[meta_and_the_metaverse | Meta]]'s plan involves identifying common internet activities and re-creating them within [[virtual_reality_vr_and_augmented_reality_ar | VR]], then investing heavily to make these [[virtual_reality_vr_and_augmented_reality_ar | VR]] versions superior to their real-life counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Gaming**: Improving existing games and enticing developers to create more immersive experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   **Meetings**: Developing virtual meeting rooms for video conferencing with features like breakout rooms and immersive presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. This includes [[developments_and_future_expectations_for_vr_and_ar | advancements]] in avatars, from current "cringey" versions to potential photorealistic avatars with real-time face and eye tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   **Remote Work**: Creating virtual office buildings for global collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, and enabling multi-monitor virtual setups for productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. [[meta_and_the_metaverse | Meta]] has partnered with Microsoft to integrate Office 365 into Workrooms and supplied thousands of headsets to Accenture for virtual work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

This strategy includes acquiring [[virtual_reality_vr_and_augmented_reality_ar | VR]] tech startups and studios, leading to a common sentiment that making a [[virtual_reality_vr_and_augmented_reality_ar | VR]] company can lead to acquisition by [[meta_and_the_metaverse | Meta]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

## The Problem with Centralization

The primary concern is the prospect of one company controlling the entire foundation of this "second-generation internet," the metaverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. [[meta_and_the_metaverse | Meta]]'s goal is to build the next foundation and control all experiences that emerge on it, from workrooms to games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

While other companies like Pico, Google, and Apple are also developing [[virtual_reality_vr_and_augmented_reality_ar | VR]] technology, [[meta_and_the_metaverse | Meta]]'s extensive investments and acquisitions have positioned them to potentially propel this technology into the mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

> [!DANGER] Risks of Over-Centralization
> The downside of a single company, especially [[meta_and_the_metaverse | Meta]], having such extensive control over individuals and the future of the internet is substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. This includes the potential for "crazy things" like using eye tracking to target specific ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

True competition among companies is crucial for driving innovation and delivering better products and services to consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. While [[meta_and_the_metaverse | Meta]]'s financial commitment could push the metaverse into the mainstream, the implications of centralized control remain a significant point of concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

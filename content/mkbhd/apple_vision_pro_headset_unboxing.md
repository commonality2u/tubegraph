The [[apple_vision_pro_hardware_and_design | Apple Vision Pro]] marks the beginning of Apple's spatial computing journey, representing their first headset, AR/VR wearable face computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This unboxing demonstrates what customers receive when purchasing the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The base model costs $3,500, but the unboxed version is the 1TB model, priced at $3,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Packaging and Initial Contents
The [[apple_vision_pro_hardware_and_design | headset]] comes in a large box, which, despite its size, contains a relatively small [[apple_vision_pro_hardware_and_design | headset]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Inside the main packaging are three smaller boxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>:
*   The [[apple_vision_pro_hardware_and_design | Vision Pro headset]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   [[components_and_accessories_of_apple_vision_pro | Vision Pro Zeiss optical inserts]], which are magnetically attachable prescription lenses for users who wear glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   The optional $200 [[components_and_accessories_of_apple_vision_pro | Vision Pro Travel Case]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

The packaging for the [[apple_vision_pro_hardware_and_design | headset]] is noted for its quality, as expected for a high-pressure first-generation Apple product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Contents of the Headset Box
Upon opening the headset box, the [[apple_vision_pro_hardware_and_design | headset]] is found with a protective cover and pre-fitted with the Solo Knit Band <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Other [[components_and_accessories_of_apple_vision_pro | accessories]] and documentation within this "shoebox-size" container include:
*   "Design by Apple in California" pamphlet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   A microfiber polishing cloth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This cloth is different from those accompanying Apple monitors and is designed for cleaning the [[apple_vision_pro_hardware_and_design | Vision Pro's glass front]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   Two [[components_and_accessories_of_apple_vision_pro | Light Seal Cushions]]: one thin and one thick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   Additional Vision Pro paperwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   The [[components_and_accessories_of_apple_vision_pro | Dual Loop Band]], an alternative to the Solo Knit Band, designed to go around and over the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   The external [[components_and_accessories_of_apple_vision_pro | battery pack]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This heavy [[components_and_accessories_of_apple_vision_pro | battery]] has a capacity of 3,166 milliamp hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a> and provides approximately 2.5 to 3 hours of use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. It connects to the headset via a proprietary magnetic connector and features a USB-C port for charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   A USB-C to USB-C braided charging cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   A 30-watt USB-C wall brick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

## Detailed Look at [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | Features and Design]]
The [[components_and_accessories_of_apple_vision_pro | included booklet]] provides instructions on setting up the device, pairing it with an [[iphone_15_and_15_pro_unboxing_experience | iPhone]], and even how to store the cable around the [[components_and_accessories_of_apple_vision_pro | battery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### Light Seal and Cushions
Users undergo a face scanning process with an [[iphone_15_and_15_pro_unboxing_experience | iPhone's]] Face ID sensors to measure their face and eyes, resulting in a custom-fitted Light Seal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. The [[components_and_accessories_of_apple_vision_pro | Light Seal Cushion]], which comes in thin and thick variants, provides extra comfort or adjusts the distance from the face, especially with optical inserts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. The [[components_and_accessories_of_apple_vision_pro | Light Seal]] magnetically attaches to the [[apple_vision_pro_hardware_and_design | headset]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### Headset [[apple_vision_pro_hardware_and_design | Hardware]]
Without the band, the [[apple_vision_pro_hardware_and_design | Vision Pro]] reveals its core computer unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. It features an aluminum housing, numerous sensors, and a glass front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. The device is notably front-weighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Small speaker drivers are positioned in pods over each ear, directing sound downwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

### Bands
The [[apple_vision_pro_features_and_design | Vision Pro]] includes two types of [[components_and_accessories_of_apple_vision_pro | bands]] to accommodate the device's weight distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>, with different sizes available (small, medium, large) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>:
*   **Solo Knit Band:** The default band, seen in commercials, is soft and stretchy, wrapping around the back of the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. It tightens with a crank mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This band places most of the headset's weight on the user's cheeks and forehead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   **Dual Loop Band:** This band goes both around the back of the head and over the top, secured with Velcro for adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. It provides a more balanced and comfortable fit, distributing the weight better than the Solo Knit Band <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

[[components_and_accessories_of_apple_vision_pro | Bands]] are easily interchangeable by pulling an orange tab to release them from the [[apple_vision_pro_hardware_and_design | headset]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

### [[components_and_accessories_of_apple_vision_pro | Travel Case]]
The optional [[components_and_accessories_of_apple_vision_pro | travel case]] serves as a protective outer layer, particularly for the glass front of the headset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. It features molded compartments for the [[apple_vision_pro_hardware_and_design | headset]], [[components_and_accessories_of_apple_vision_pro | battery]], and [[components_and_accessories_of_apple_vision_pro | charging accessories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. Its design makes it suitable for travel, especially for use cases like long flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

### [[components_and_accessories_of_apple_vision_pro | Zeiss Lenses]]
For users with prescriptions, $100 for readers or $150 for prescription lenses can be purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. These small lenses magnetically snap into the [[apple_vision_pro_hardware_and_design | headset]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. After attachment, a code on the lenses is scanned by the [[apple_vision_pro_hardware_and_design | headset]] to adjust the display according to the user's prescription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

## [[setting_up_the_apple_vision_pro_for_the_first_time | First Boot-Up and Setup]]
To power on the [[apple_vision_pro_hardware_and_design | Vision Pro]] for the first time, the [[components_and_accessories_of_apple_vision_pro | battery]]'s proprietary circular connector is aligned with a dot on the left side of the [[apple_vision_pro_hardware_and_design | headset]] and twisted to lock it in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. The headset will then glow, indicating it's booting up, which takes about one minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. The initial setup process begins with a "hello script" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. Further setup details, [[user_experience_and_interface_of_apple_vision_pro | user experience]], games, and app usage will be covered in subsequent videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

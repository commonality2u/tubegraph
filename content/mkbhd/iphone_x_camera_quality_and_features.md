The [[iPhone X display features and performance | iPhone X]] includes slightly new cameras compared to its predecessors, sharing the same sensors as the [[iPhone 8 Plus camera performance and features | iPhone 8 Plus]] but featuring better glass and optical stabilization for both cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. This marks a significant improvement, particularly for the 2x telephoto lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

## Rear Camera Performance

Photos captured with the [[iPhone X display features and performance | iPhone X]] are described as "awesome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

### Dynamic Range and HDR
The camera shows improved dynamic range, with HDR performance being "a lot less aggressive" than on previous [[iPhone camera capabilities and features | iPhone cameras]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. This results in photos that "pop," featuring vibrant blue skies and excellent detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. Color accuracy is also noted as "tight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

### Comparison
While the [[iPhone X display features and performance | iPhone X]] camera is considered a "top five smartphone camera," it is not as good as the Google Pixel 2's camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

### Video
For video, the [[iPhone X display features and performance | iPhone X]] allows for 4K video recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

## Front-Facing Camera

The [[iPhone X display features and performance | iPhone X]]'s front-facing camera might be the best for video among smartphones, despite a tendency to overexpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

### Portrait Mode
Portrait mode has been added to the front-facing camera for "portrait selfies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. However, its performance is not as effective as the back-facing camera or the Pixel 2, often blurring edges to a "comical amount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
It's suggested that the [[iPhone X display features and performance | iPhone X]]'s portrait mode for the front camera could improve with software updates, as it already boasts better color accuracy than competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

### Physical Design Considerations
The vertical orientation of the camera bump on the [[iPhone X display features and performance | iPhone X]] makes it easy to accidentally get a finger in the photo or video frame, requiring some adjustment from users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Animoji

A fun and exclusive feature of the [[iPhone X display features and performance | iPhone X]] is Animoji, which uses facial tracking to create moving emoji <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. This feature is exclusive to the [[iPhone X display features and performance | iPhone X]], meaning it cannot be used on other [[iPhone camera capabilities and features | iPhone]] models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. When sent to an Android phone, Animoji appears as a video message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

Despite being a facial tracking feature, Animoji primarily utilizes the front-facing camera and still functions even when depth sensors and other front-facing sensors are covered, implying it could have been made available on other [[iPhone camera capabilities and features | iPhone]] models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

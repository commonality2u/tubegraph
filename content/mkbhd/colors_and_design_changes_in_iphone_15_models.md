The [[new_features_of_the_iphone_15_lineup|iPhone 15 lineup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> introduces new colors, materials, and ports across all models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, providing a "slightly new unboxing experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## iPhone 15 and 15 Plus

Both the [[iPhone 15 and 15 Pro major changes|iPhone 15]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> and 15 Plus feature subtle colors this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

*   **Colors**: The new blue color on the [[iPhone 15 and 15 Pro major changes|iPhone 15]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> is described as "barely blue" due to its subtle hint of color, visible even on the side rails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The iPhone 15 Plus comes in an "incredibly pale yellow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, which appears very pale outside of perfect lighting conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Finish**: Apple has implemented a new softer-touch satin finish on the back of these models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Design**: A significant [[design_and_usability_changes_in_the_iphone_16e|design change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a> for both the iPhone 15 and [[iPhone 15 Pro design and build changes|iPhone 15 Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a> is the slightly softer curves all the way around the phones. Unlike the [[iPhone 14 design and pricing|iPhone 14]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, which had a very square design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, the new phones feature front glass with a slight curve at the edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, transitioning softly into the rail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. The rail itself also has softer curves compared to the sharp corners of previous models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This creates a hybrid look that is more comfortable in hand while retaining the generally boxy aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max

The [[new_features_and_hardware_of_iphone_15_pro|Pro models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a> come in white boxes with dark wallpapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

*   **Colors**: The [[iphone_15_pro_design_and_build_changes|iPhone 15 Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a> introduces a new dark blue color that is also subtle, bordering on gray depending on the light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The [[iphone_15_pro_design_and_build_changes|iPhone 15 Pro Max]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a> debuts the Natural Titanium color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, which is highly recommended as "the one to get" and the best color in person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Materials**: A major change is the switch from shiny stainless steel to brushed titanium for the rail material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This contributes to the phones being approximately 10% lighter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. While the brushed finish might seem to reduce fingerprints, they are still visible, especially on darker colors like black or blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. The colored titanium utilizes a PVD coating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. A potential concern is that deep scratches could expose the very light Natural Titanium underneath, which might look "rough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. For this reason, the Natural Titanium or lighter colors are suggested as better choices for durability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Design**: The [[design_and_build_quality_of_the_iphone_15_pro|iPhone 15 Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a> models feature technically thinner bezels, resulting in a slightly smaller body, though this is not significantly noticeable after a few minutes of use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Similar to the base models, the Pro phones also incorporate slightly softer curves all the way around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This includes a subtle curve at the edges of the front glass, leading into a softer curve on the rail, moving away from the "so square" [[iphone_12_design_changes|design]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a> of the [[iPhone 14 design and pricing|iPhone 14]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Action Button**: The new Action button on the Pro models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a> is highly customizable, with no apparent restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. By default, it acts as the mute switch, providing two distinct haptic patterns to confirm mute/unmute status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Other pre-programmed options include opening the camera (in various modes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a> or turning on the flashlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. A convenient feature is the voice memo trigger, which immediately starts recording when the button is pressed and held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. The most versatile option is the Siri Shortcuts function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>, allowing users to stack multiple functions (e.g., location-dependent actions, calling a contact) or open any app with zero lag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. The Action button is also confirmed to feel "nice and clicky" even when using a case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

## General Design Elements

*   **USB-C Cable**: All new [[new_features_of_the_iphone_15_lineup|iPhones]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a> now ship with a single, white, braided USB-C to USB-C cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This is the first time iPhones have included a braided cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, suggesting it may be of higher quality and more durable than previous cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **SIM Card Ejector**: In the US, the SIM card ejector tool is no longer included in the box, as all models now support eSIM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Internal Changes**: Batteries are reportedly slightly bigger across the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   **Camera Lens Coating**: A new coating over the camera lenses was mentioned in the keynote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. However, this coating unfortunately does not fix the persistent nighttime flare issues with iPhone video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. The new [[camera_improvements_in_iphone_15_series|camera behavior]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a> on the Pro phones, involving 1x, 1.2x, and 1.5x options, is clarified as a set of Super Res Zoom presets rather than a simple digital crop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

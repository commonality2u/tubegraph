The [[iPhone 13 Pro screen improvements | iPhone 13 Pro]] and 13 Pro Max offer significant improvements in battery life compared to previous models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. These advancements stem from several compounding factors that contribute to their impressive endurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

## Factors Contributing to Battery Life
Several key elements work together to deliver the improved battery performance in the iPhone 13 Pro models:
*   **ProMotion Display** The ProMotion display, an adaptive variable refresh rate technology, can ramp down to as low as 10Hz when a higher refresh rate isn't needed, such as when viewing a static image or reading text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This dynamic adjustment helps conserve battery power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. The use of an LTPO display allows for both high refresh rates and battery efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **A15 Bionic Chip** The A15 Bionic chip is more power-efficient than its predecessor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Larger Physical Battery** The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max are slightly thicker and heavier, allowing for the inclusion of physically larger batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. The [[iPhone 11 Pro battery and performance | iPhone 13 Pro]] battery is approximately 11% larger than the [[iPhone 12 display and battery performance | 12 Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. The [[Battery life improvements in iPhone 13 | iPhone 13 Pro Max]] battery is about 18% larger than the 12 Pro Max <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. This increase in battery size is noticeable in the phone's weight, which is about 20 grams heavier than previous models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

## Battery Performance
The combination of these factors results in significant battery life improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   The [[iPhone 11 Pro battery and performance | iPhone 13 Pro]] typically achieves six to seven hours of screen-on time and can easily last a full day without needing a charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   The [[Battery life improvements in iPhone 13 | iPhone 13 Pro Max]] demonstrates even more impressive endurance, with one test showing 5 hours of screen-on time with 50% battery remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This places the [[Battery life improvements in iPhone 13 | iPhone 13 Pro Max]] at the top of 2021 battery performance rankings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### Charging Considerations
Despite the larger battery, the [[Battery life improvements in iPhone 13 | iPhone 13 Pro Max]] still takes a considerable amount of time to fully charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. The device can support up to 27 Watts of charging with a higher-powered brick, which is not included in the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

### Limited Frame Rate Setting
Users can limit the display's refresh rate to 60Hz in the accessibility settings under "motion" and "limit frame rate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. However, given the ProMotion display's ability to actively drop below 60Hz for battery saving, this setting might not significantly extend battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

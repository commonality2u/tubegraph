Apple's over-ear, wireless, noise-canceling headphones, the [[airpods_max_design_and_build_quality | AirPods Max]], were introduced at a cost of $550 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The name "AirPods Max" is consistent with Apple's other audio products, which all include "pod" in their names, such as EarPods, AirPods, and HomePods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## First Impressions and Unboxing
The [[airpods_max_packaging_and_accessories | AirPods Max]] come in a notably large box for headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Upon opening, the headphones are found pre-inserted into their [[airpods_max_packaging_and_accessories | Smart Case]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. A distinctive feature is that the headphones do not fold or pack down, traveling and shipping specifically within this case, with the band serving as a handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The metal components of the headphones are "legit cold to the touch" upon first handling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The overall aesthetic is unique, described as a modernized version of classic, large planar magnetic headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Materials and Construction
The [[airpods_max_design_and_build_quality | AirPods Max]] feature high-quality materials:
*   **Frame** The frame is made of stainless steel, offering flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Ear Cups** The ear cups are constructed from aluminum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Telescoping Arms** These shiny arms connect the ear cups, allowing them to move over 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. The slide mechanism for expansion is satisfying due to its resistance, preferred over typical plastic clicks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **Headband** A mesh band at the top is designed to evenly distribute weight across the head and provide breathability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. It is notably soft, though long-term durability is yet to be determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

The build quality is exceptional, with "no creaks, no gaps anywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Aside from a lack of sweat or water resistance, the construction is considered top-tier for high-grade headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Weight
Due to the extensive use of metal, the [[airpods_max_design_and_build_quality | AirPods Max]] are heavy headphones, weighing 386 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. This is significantly heavier compared to, for example, the Sony XM4s, which weigh 250 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## Color Options
The [[airpods_max_design_and_build_quality | AirPods Max]] are available in colors consistent with the iPad Air lineup: black, silver, light blue, pink, and minty green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. The minty green color may not be the "best looking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Magnetic Ear Cups
The ear cups on the [[airpods_max_design_and_build_quality | AirPods Max]] are magnetic, allowing them to pop off easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. They remain securely in place during use but can be pulled off when intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This design is considered smart, as ear cups are typically the part of headphones that wear out and need replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. While the metal exterior is durable, the softer internal materials of ear pads are prone to aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. New ear pads can be purchased from Apple for $60 a set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, and users can mix and match colors if desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

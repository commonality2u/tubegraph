The iPhone 11 Pro, released in 2019, represents Apple's highest-end phones for that year. While the name "Pro" is debated due to the perceived lack of significant "pro" features, the device primarily focuses on four major areas: design, display, battery life, and cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

The iPhone 11 Pro is largely familiar compared to the models from the previous two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Design and Build
The design of the iPhone 11 Pro, initially met with skepticism, tends to grow on users when held in person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Key design and build elements:
*   **Matte Finish** A new matte finish is introduced, enhancing the phone's look and feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. While slightly slipperier than glossy, it's a preferred option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Camera Square** The most distinctive new design element is the camera square on the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. It's cut from a single piece of glass, creating an optical illusion where it looks indented despite sticking out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. The camera bumps cause the phone to rock slightly when placed on a table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Glass Durability** Apple states the iPhone 11 Pro features "the toughest glass in any smartphone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. While glass can still shatter if dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, it appears to be less prone to scratching compared to the Pixel 3's matte black glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Front Design** The front of the phone is "almost exactly the same thing as last year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, featuring the same screen sizes, resolutions, notch, and bezels as its predecessor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Face ID** [[software_and_features_in_iphone_11_pro | Face ID]] has been improved to be up to 30% faster and work at a larger variety of angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. While a slight speed increase is noticeable when compared side-by-side with an older phone, the improvement in angles for unlocking from a flat surface is not observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Physical Changes** The buttons are positioned very slightly lower on each phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Water resistance has been upgraded while maintaining the IP68 certification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The phone is also slightly thicker and heavier, with the Pro Max being 20 grams heavier than the previous year's model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Battery Life and Performance
A significant improvement in the iPhone 11 Pro is its "excellent" battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. This is partly due to the removal of 3D Touch, which freed up space for a larger battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. While the [[comparison_between_iphone_11_and_iphone_10r | iPhone 11]] saw a one-hour increase in battery life over the iPhone 10R due to A13 Bionic improvements, the iPhone 11 Pro saw a four-hour increase over the [[comparison between iPhone XR and iPhone XS | iPhone XS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Users can expect 7 to 8 hours of screen-on time and a full day of battery life under heavy usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

[[iPhone 11 Pro battery and performance | Performance]] is driven by the new A13 Bionic chip and 4GB of RAM in the Pro models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. This ensures the phone is "extremely fast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, with improvements over the A12 chip designed to maintain speed over the phone's lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

## Display
The iPhone 11 Pro's display, named the "Super Retina XDR display," is impressive despite its "lame" name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   **Brightness and Contrast** The display can achieve a sustained brightness of 800 nits, with peak brightness reaching up to 1200 nits for brief moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. It also boasts a 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. While subtle in everyday use, the improved brightness is noticeable when watching HDR content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **3D Touch vs. Haptic Touch** The physical 3D Touch feature has been removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a> and largely replaced by Haptic Touch, which uses long presses to replicate most of the previous functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Efficiency** The display is also more power-efficient, contributing to the overall battery gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Camera Capabilities
The cameras are a primary focus for the iPhone 11 Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. It features a new triple-camera system: a primary 12-megapixel sensor, a 2x telephoto camera, and a 0.5x ultrawide camera with a 120-degree field of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

[[iPhone 11 Pro camera capabilities | Camera Improvements]]:
*   **Daylight Photography** The cameras are a significant improvement over the [[software_and_features_in_iphone_11_pro | iPhone 10S]], often taking "the best sharpest and cleanest photos" seen on a smartphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Colors are realistic, dynamic range is excellent, and tonal mapping for subjects is "next level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. The iPhone 11 Pro's photos are considered to be the closest representation of what the human eye sees, even when compared to the Pixel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
*   **Ultrawide Camera** The long-awaited ultrawide camera is "fine" and "really fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. It offers good consistency in color and white balance with the other lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. However, due to a smaller sensor and slower glass, its quality and detail are noticeably a step down, appearing softer with more noise reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   **Camera UI** The camera app's user interface has been improved, simplifying controls for one-handed access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. It now provides an ultrawide preview when opening the camera, though this can be distracting and cannot be manually disabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Night Mode** A dedicated night mode is included, which activates automatically in low light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. There is no manual toggle for this feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. The UI for night mode is excellent, offering live exposure adjustments and longer capture times when stabilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Night shots are very good, with no clear overall winner for best night mode among smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Compared to Pixel's Night Sight, iPhone's night mode is truer to life and captures more detailed and sharper low-light photos, though it doesn't always activate in dim light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. The ultrawide camera does not support night mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   **Video Capabilities** The iPhone 11 Pro still offers the best video quality of any smartphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. The UI now allows for quick video recording by holding down the shutter button, similar to Instagram or Snapchat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

## Software
The iPhone 11 Pro ships with iOS 13, which includes features like Dark Mode and Haptic Touch for quick settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. While these are beneficial, iOS 13 experienced some bugs and issues, such as freezing camera apps or lock screen control problems, which were expected to be resolved in future updates like iOS 13.1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. The U1 chip, intended for ultra-wideband signal for locating other U1-enabled devices and improving AirDrop, was not enabled in the initial software version but was anticipated for iOS 13.1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. The overall software experience remains largely unchanged, with the same UI and feature set, aside from new additions like Night Mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

## Overall Upgrade Value
The iPhone 11 Pro is considered a great upgrade, especially due to improvements in core functions like speed, battery life, and camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. However, it lacks "pro" features that many anticipated, such as a new design, a smaller notch, USB-C, a high refresh rate "ProMotion" display, Touch ID under the display, or reverse wireless charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

The key focuses for the iPhone 11 Pro are the A13 chip, improved battery life, slightly enhanced display, and new cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. It is particularly recommended for those who prioritize the best smartphone camera or engage in professional content creation on their phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. For others, the non-Pro [[comparison_of_iphone_14_pro_with_previous_models | iPhone 11]] is a viable alternative, offering the same cameras and processing and great battery life (minus the telephoto lens) at a $300 lower price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

Overall, the iPhone 11 Pro is a "really great phone" and a worthwhile upgrade for users who don't have an [[design_and_build_differences_between_iphone_12_and_12_pro | iPhone 10S]], especially for its camera improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. However, the anticipation for the 2020 iPhone (or [[comparing_iphone_16e_to_other_iphone_models | iPhone 12]]) might deter some potential buyers from purchasing the current model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

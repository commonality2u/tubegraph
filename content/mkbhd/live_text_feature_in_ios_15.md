Live Text, introduced in [[ios_15_new_features_overview | iOS 15]], is a feature that allows users to interact with text found within images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. It is described as a "smart" and "cool" addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

## How it Works
The [[live_objects_and_live_text_features | Live Text]] feature processes information directly on the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Any image containing text, whether captured by the camera or found in the photo gallery, can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Users can long-press on the text within an image, and the system will recognize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

Once recognized, the text can be treated like any other editable text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Capabilities include:
*   Selecting all text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>
*   Copying and pasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>
*   Translating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>
*   Using the "lookup" feature to get suggestions, especially useful if a place or company name is present in the text, allowing Siri to find it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

[[live_objects_and_live_text_features | Live Text]] has demonstrated good performance with various types of text, including printed and even handwritten text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Limitations and Capabilities
*   **Video Incompatibility**: This feature does not work with videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
*   **Animal Recognition**: It can also recognize objects in photos, such as animals, attempting to identify breeds when long-pressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Device Compatibility**: [[live_objects_and_live_text_features | Live Text]] requires devices equipped with an A12 Bionic chip or later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This means not all older iPhone models will support it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

The feature is seen as Apple's intuitive approach to functionalities similar to Google Lens, allowing direct interaction with text on a photo without needing a separate application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. While Google Lens might identify a broader range of objects, [[live_objects_and_live_text_features | Live Text]] is considered "more intuitive" for text recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

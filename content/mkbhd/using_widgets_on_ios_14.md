## Level 2: Enthusiast Customization (Third-Party Widgets)

For those seeking more adventure, [[Thirdparty widgets for iOS 14 | third-party widgets]] unlock deeper customization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. With [[New Home Screen Features in iOS 14 | iOS 14]], developers are creating dedicated [[Thirdparty widgets for iOS 14 | widgets]] designed for superior aesthetics and functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

Notable [[Thirdparty widgets for iOS 14 | third-party widget]] examples include:
*   **Timepage**: Offers a sleek, minimal weather [[Widgets on iOS 14 | widget]], even though it's primarily a productivity app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **HeyWeather**: Provides various sizes and greater customization options for weather [[Widgets on iOS 14 | widgets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Google Widget**: The larger version allows for quick Google searches, voice searches, incognito text searches, and Google Lens for image-based searching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

Apps like **Color Widgets**, **Widgery**, and **Widgetsmith** are emerging as dedicated platforms for comprehensive [[Widgets on iOS 14 | widget]] customization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. These apps offer unique UIs to tailor [[Widgets on iOS 14 | widgets]] to display diverse information such as health data (from Apple Watch), news tickers, stocks, weather, date/time, battery life, and calendar events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Users can precisely control the appearance, including colors and gradients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. While many [[Thirdparty widgets for iOS 14 | third-party widgets]] offer basic functionality for free, advanced customization features often require in-app purchases or subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

## Level 3: Advanced Customization (Custom Icons via Shortcuts)

The most extreme [[iOS 14 home screen customization levels | home screen customization]] seen on [[New Home Screen Features in iOS 14 | iOS 14]], including custom app icons and color themes, is achieved through [[New Home Screen Features in iOS 14 | Siri Shortcuts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. It's important to note that these are not true custom icons but rather shortcuts that launch applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

To create a custom icon shortcut:
1.  Open the [[New Home Screen Features in iOS 14 | Siri Shortcuts]] app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
2.  Tap the plus (+) icon to add a new action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
3.  Select "Open App" and choose the desired application (e.g., Camera) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
4.  Tap the three dots (...) and select "Add to [[New Home Screen Features in iOS 14 | Home Screen]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
5.  Customize the icon's name (can be left blank for a cleaner look) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
6.  Choose an image for the icon from photos or files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
7.  Add the shortcut to the [[New Home Screen Features in iOS 14 | home screen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

However, using [[New Home Screen Features in iOS 14 | Siri Shortcuts]] for custom icons has drawbacks:
*   Every time a shortcut icon is tapped, it first opens the [[New Home Screen Features in iOS 14 | Siri Shortcuts]] app before launching the target app, creating a brief delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   Custom icons do not display notification badges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

Despite these limitations, users are creating impressive color-coded [[New Home Screen Features in iOS 14 | home screens]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Various icon packs and individual photos can be used to achieve a consistent aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

While [[New Home Screen Features in iOS 14 | iOS 14]]'s customization options may seem limited compared to other platforms, they represent a significant step forward from previous iOS versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

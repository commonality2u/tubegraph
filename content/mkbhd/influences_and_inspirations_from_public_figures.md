The speaker reflects on the influence of public figures, particularly in how they inspire others and how role models are perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Inspiration from Neil deGrasse Tyson
The decision to share personal experiences was directly inspired by a post from [[Reflections on race and personal experiences | Neil deGrasse Tyson]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The speaker read Tyson's post out of curiosity about his experience, finding it thoughtful and insightful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This inspiration led the speaker to believe his own experience might be useful for others for the same reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Defining Role Models
The speaker emphasizes a "very narrow definition" for picking a role model, focusing on what individuals are good at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

### Examples of Specific Admiration
*   **Tiger Woods**: When playing golf, the speaker looked up to [[Tiger Woods]] specifically as "the golfer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Kobe Bryant**: The speaker admired [[Kobe Bryant]] as "the competitor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## Using a Platform for Advocacy
As an adult with a platform, the speaker feels it is important to express support for beliefs, including those pertaining to social issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Despite the common sentiment to "stick to tech," silence on issues plaguing the community "feels worse" than speaking up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This aligns with [[Using platforms for advocacy and antiracism | using platforms for advocacy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

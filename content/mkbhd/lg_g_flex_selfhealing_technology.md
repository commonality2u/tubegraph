The LG G Flex is noted as a highly interesting phone, partly due to its unique self-healing capabilities and [[durability_of_lg_g_flex | durability]] highlighted in an official LG YouTube video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The self-healing property of the LG G Flex involves two main aspects: the special [[material_design_of_lg_g_flex | backing material]] and its [[flexibility_and_structure_of_lg_g_flex | curved design or flex]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Self-Healing Backing Material

The back of the LG G Flex features a smooth, almost velvety texture, similar to the Galaxy S4, which allows users to easily feel scratches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### LG's Official Demonstration
LG's official video demonstrated the phone's ability to heal scratches on its back. In the demonstration, a bronze brush was used to create even scratches on the phone's back. After two minutes, the G Flex's scratches almost completely healed, unlike a regular phone back which remained scratched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. However, this demonstration used optimal controlled conditions, including an air temperature of 27.4 degrees Celsius (81 degrees Fahrenheit), which is the equivalent of a warm summer day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Real-World Testing
In independent testing, the self-healing feature was put to the test against more common scenarios like scratches from keys, which might occur if a phone is placed in the same pocket as keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. After intentionally scuffing the back with keys, the scratches were mostly minimized within a few minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. While not completely gone, they were significantly less noticeable than when fresh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This could be beneficial for minor scuffs, making them barely noticeable after a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Impact of Temperature
The healing process can be accelerated by warming up the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Actions like rubbing the phone quickly, holding it close to the body, or playing intensive games can help increase its temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
A deep scratch made with a knife across the back of the device showed partial healing after a few hours, being about halfway gone and barely noticeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This is still considered impressive compared to any other [[material_design_of_lg_g_flex | traditional phone material]], although it does take a while for deeper scratches to heal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Flexible Design
The LG G Flex's self-healing properties also extend to its [[flexibility_and_structure_of_lg_g_flex | curved design or flex]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The phone can be completely flattened from its curved shape without incurring any internal damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Despite housing a large 3500 mAh battery, a six-inch display, and standard components like a processor and RAM, the phone holds up to being [[flexibility_and_structure_of_lg_g_flex | flexed]] just as demonstrated in LG's advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This level of resiliency is noted as highly impressive, especially when compared to other curved phones like the Samsung Galaxy Round, which is merely rounded and does not [[flexibility_and_structure_of_lg_g_flex | flex]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

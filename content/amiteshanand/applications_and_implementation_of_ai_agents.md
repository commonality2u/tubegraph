AI agents are software entities designed to autonomously perform tasks, learn, and adapt to user needs by taking actions based on predefined inputs and instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. They differ from [[difference_between_ai_agents_and_ai_chatbots | AI chatbots]], which are typically conversational interfaces limited to predefined scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Key Components of AI Agents
The structure of an AI agent is built around three core components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>:
*   **Perception** – The ability to gather data through API calls or user input, going beyond simple tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Decision-Making** – Utilizing LLM models or rule-based logic to process information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Action** – Executing tasks, generating outputs, or enabling users to download results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Applications of AI Agents
[[types_and_features_of_ai_agents | AI agents]] have broad applications across various domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>:
*   **Business Automation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>
*   **Visualized Systems** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>
*   **Autonomous Systems** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>
*   **Personal Use Cases** – Such as sending emails based on defined rules and instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Enterprise Use Cases** – Including accelerating coding or documentation generation within a company's codebase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Marketing** – Setting instructions and using LLMs to help with marketing tasks more accurately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Security Agents** – Large investments are being made in security agents, which can sometimes overwhelm human capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

## Key Features for Implementation
When implementing [[types_and_features_of_ai_agents | AI agents]], several features can be incorporated based on their purpose:
*   **Memory** – Allows agents to retain context from previous conversations or tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, such as short-term memory for the last 100 inferences or long-term memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   **Tool Calling / API Integration** – Enables agents to interact with external APIs, performing tasks like posting on social media or retrieving real-time data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **Function Calling** – Allows agents to execute custom functions tailored to specific requirements, enhancing versatility by generating structured outputs and performing function executions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Security and Human-in-the-Loop (Moderation and Oversight)** – Involves human supervision to ensure accuracy and appropriateness before actions are executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This feature, which is still under development by some platforms, helps improve AI efficiency for complex tasks through collaborative decision-making with human judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Humanizer** – Adds a human touch to the AI agent's responses, allowing changes to tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
*   **Responsible AI Options** – Includes features like context relevance (maintaining conversation context) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>, accuracy (grounding responses in provided context) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>, reflection (allowing the agent to reflect on responses to improve accuracy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>, fairness and biases reduction, and toxicity checks to prevent harmful content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

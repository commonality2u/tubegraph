This article details the process of [[Building VSCode extensions without coding | building a VS Code extension]] using Cursor, a tool that leverages AI models to generate code. The demonstrated extension aims to assist with coding tasks.

## Extension Overview
The VS Code extension, built using Cursor, is designed to help developers with coding tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. It leverages the DeepSeek and Qwen models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The entire codebase for this extension was generated by Cursor based on an initial prompt and subsequent iterations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The project's repository is publicly available for those interested in trying it out or contributing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Building and Running the Extension
To build the extension, the code files are present in Cursor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. After compilation, the extension runs by opening a VS Code development host server by pressing `F5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Users can then access the "deep coin coded chat" through `command sh p` within the VS Code environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Model Integration and API Keys
The extension integrates several AI models for its functionality, including:
*   DC Coder V2 light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
*   Qwen 2.5 coders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a> (both 7B and 32B instruct variants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>)
*   DC B3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>

These models are accessed via [[NV Studio | NV AI Studio]], which serves as an inference provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Users need to obtain API keys from [[NV Studio | NV AI Studio]] after signing up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, where they can receive initial credits, such as a $1 sign-up bonus and potentially additional coupon-based credits like $25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

## Functionality and Demonstration
The extension allows users to:
*   **Explain Code**: Users can paste code snippets and ask the AI to explain them. For example, using Qwen 2.5 coder, the AI can break down and explain [[Coding in JavaScript | JavaScript]] code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Convert Code**: The extension can attempt to convert code between languages. For instance, it can translate [[Coding in JavaScript | JavaScript]] code to Python using the DPC coder V2 light model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Add CSS**: It can also generate CSS code for styling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

## Iterative Improvement with Cursor
Despite Cursor doing most of the work, initial UI and formatting might not be ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The developer used Cursor's chat functionality to iterate and improve the extension. For example, prompts were used to:
*   "Improve overall UI ux of this extension" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>
*   "Improve format by making sentence bold italic and picking colors for code responses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>

Cursor can make significant changes, such as modifying the `chat panel.TS` file for UI enhancements including styling, font colors, bold/italic formatting, and code formatting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Although initial iterations might have minor issues (e.g., broken HTML tags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>), Cursor can fix them with further prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## Conclusion
Cursor proved to be a powerful tool, capable of building an entire VS Code extension in a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Tools like Cursor and Wind Surfer can significantly accelerate development, reducing project timelines from days to hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The repository for this extension is available for community contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

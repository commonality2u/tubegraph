Nebius AI Studio is a robust platform designed to host a variety of open-source and state-of-the-art AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. It offers functionalities that streamline workflows, particularly for tasks like content creation and review, by allowing [[using_thirdparty_tools_in_ai_development | integration with third-party tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Core Capabilities

Nebius AI Studio enables users to perform several key tasks without leaving their primary workspace, such as a blog writing platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>:

*   **Content Review and Suggestions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>: Users can quickly review written content and receive AI-generated suggestions for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   [[text_and_image_generation_using_nebius_ai_models | **Image Generation**]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>: The platform allows for the generation of images on the fly, based directly on the provided text content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Hosted Models

The studio hosts several advanced models, categorized by their primary function:

*   **Text-to-Text Models** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>:
    *   **DeepSeek V3** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
    *   **DeepSeek R1** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>: This model is particularly noted for its reasoning capabilities, similar to GPT-4o, using a Chain of Thought approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. It is also more cost-effective to run compared to GPT-4o <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Both DeepSeek models can be used for evaluating and reviewing technical content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Text-to-Image Models** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>:
    *   **Flux-Schell** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>: Used for generating images based on text input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
    *   **Stable Diffusion models** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>

## [[api_and_model_integration_with_nebius_ai_studio | API Integration]]

Nebius AI Studio provides [[api_integration_with_nvs_ai_studio_for_model_usage | APIs]] that can be integrated into various applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. These [[api_and_model_integration_with_nebius_ai_studio | APIs]] are available for JavaScript, Python, and cURL requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This flexibility allows developers to build custom tools, such as Chrome extensions, that leverage the studio's AI capabilities directly within other platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Example Use Case: Technical Writing Chrome Extension

A practical demonstration of Nebius AI Studio's integration capabilities is a Chrome extension built for technical writers on platforms like dev.to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This extension, built using Nebius AI Studio's [[api_and_model_integration_with_nebius_ai_studio | APIs]], allows users to:

*   **Generate images from selected text** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Users can highlight a section of text, right-click, and choose "generate image from text" to create a relevant image that can then be copied and pasted into their article <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Review and update text with AI** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. By selecting text and choosing "review the text with AI," the extension provides suggestions based on the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Contextual access** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>: AI tools are accessible directly as hover items or through right-click menus upon text selection, preventing the need to navigate to external websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

This integration enhances the user experience by centralizing AI-powered assistance, allowing creators to focus on their content without interruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

Traditionally, technical writers creating content for platforms like Dev.to often need to use external tools for tasks such as generating images or reviewing blog posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This process typically involves copying sections of text, opening a new website like ChatGPT or Claude, using an LLM for review, and then manually applying suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Streamlining Workflow with a Chrome Extension

A newly developed Chrome extension aims to eliminate the need to leave the writing platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This extension allows users to [[optimizing_content_with_ai_tools | review content]] and [[image_generation_with_nebius_ai_and_flux_model | generate images]] on the fly, directly within their blog post environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Powered by Nebius AI Studio

The capabilities of this Chrome extension are made possible with the help of [[integration_of_nebius_ai_for_advanced_ai_functionalities | Nebius AI Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. [[integration_of_nebius_ai_for_advanced_ai_functionalities | Nebius AI Studio]] is a platform that hosts various [[open_source_alternatives_for_ai | open source models]], including state-of-the-art and the latest models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

For text-to-text functionalities, it offers models like Deeps V3 and Deeps R1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. For text-to-image generation, it supports Flux Schell and Stable Diffusion models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The Chrome extension utilizes Deeps V3 and Deeps R1 for evaluating technical content and providing suggestions, while the Flux model is used for image generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. [[integration_of_nebius_ai_for_advanced_ai_functionalities | Nebius AI Studio]] provides APIs in JavaScript, Python, and C requests, which were used to build the extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Key Features

### [[image_generation_with_nebius_ai_and_flux_model | Image Generation]]
Writers can select a section of text within their article, then right-click or use hovering buttons to access an "AI tool" option and click "generate image from text" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The extension then generates an image based on the selected content, which can be easily copied and pasted into the blog post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### [[optimizing_content_with_ai_tools | Content Review]]
Similar to image generation, users can select text, access the "AI tools" menu, and choose "review the text with AI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This feature provides suggestions based on the content, which can then be easily applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
The review functionality offers a choice between different models:
*   **Deeps V3** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>
*   **Deeps R1**: This is a reasoning model that uses the Chain of Thought, similar to GPT-4o1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. It is also significantly more cost-effective to run compared to GPT-4o1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Benefits

This integrated approach offers a significant ease of use, allowing writers to stay focused on their blog content without needing to navigate to multiple external platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. It empowers technical writers by providing immediate access to AI capabilities for both content review and image creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

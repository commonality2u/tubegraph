The [[pieces_live_context_feature_demonstration | Live Context]] feature in Pieces is designed to help users summarize their recent work, whether from the same day or the previous week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Activating Live Context
To utilize Live Context, the "work stream pattern engine" should be enabled. In a demonstration, it was noted that the engine was already on, allowing direct use of the [[pieces_live_context_feature_demonstration | Live Context]] feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Capabilities and Demonstrations

### Summarizing Recent Activities
Live Context can identify and summarize activities performed by the user just minutes before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
For example, when asked "tell me what I was doing few minutes ago," Pieces provided a summary of tasks, including:
*   Using OBS Studio for recording a video stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   Having YouTube open on Mozilla Firefox, watching a video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   Reading a tech-related newsletter titled "Job Hunt All Things St" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

The feature effectively picks up on activities within applications like Mozilla Firefox and OBS Studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Detailing Browser Workflow
Live Context can provide more detailed insights into browser activities, especially when related to browsing [[web_development_communities | web development communities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
When prompted, "can you tell me more things I was doing inside Mozilla today based on workflow browsing de Community," the response included:
*   Browsing articles on `de.read`, such as "100 free front end challenges" (tagged with 'web' and 'days') <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   Viewing an article titled "why my coffee pot is my best code reviewer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   Watching YouTube videos and reading newsletters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Summarizing Specific Content
The feature can summarize specific content, such as a newsletter the user was reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
For the "Job Hunt All Things St" newsletter, Live Context provided details based on the context:
*   **Purpose**: To save knowledge and insights about authentic content encounters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Content**: Each issue includes insights or writing context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Goal**: To deliver, teach, and share interesting and valuable information beyond daily encounters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Publication**: New issues are published on random days and weeks each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

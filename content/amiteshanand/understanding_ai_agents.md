AI agents are a core topic in artificial intelligence, representing software entities capable of performing tasks autonomously, learning, and adapting to user needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:23">[01:21:23]</a>. They execute tasks and perform actions based on predefined inputs and instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:40">[01:29:40]</a>.

## [[differences_between_ai_agents_and_ai_chatbots | Differences between AI Agents and AI Chatbots]]

While both involve AI, a key distinction exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>:
*   **AI Chatbots** are conversational interfaces that interact with users via text or voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. They are often limited to predefined scripts, similar to ChatGPT or Gemini interfaces used for uploading pictures, transforming images, or getting information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.
*   **AI Agents** are pieces of software or programs built with specific instructions to perform a specific task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. They can perform tasks autonomously, learn, and adapt to user needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

## Structure of AI Agents

AI agents have key components that allow them to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>:
*   **Perception**: Ability to make API calls or take data from users, going beyond simple tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
*   **Decision-Making**: Utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) or rule-based logic to decide actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.
*   **Action**: Executes tasks, generates outputs, or allows users to download results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

## Types of AI Agents

There are three main types of AI agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>:
*   **Reactive Agents**: Simple, rule-based systems that perform one or two tasks based on defined inputs and instructions, similar to a chatbot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.
*   **Deliberative Agents**: Used for planning and reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. An example is an Open-DP researcher, which performs web searches, extracts information, analyzes it with an LLM, and provides output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. They can also be multimodal, with multiple LLMs performing different tasks based on predefined instructions and rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Agents**: A combination of both reactive and deliberative agents, capable of performing both simple and complex tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

## Applications of AI Agents

## [[key_features_and_applications_of_ai_agents | Key Features of AI Agents]]

The features of an [[key_features_and_applications_of_ai_agents | AI agent]] depend on its purpose, whether for personal use or enterprise cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>:
*   **Memory**: Agents can retain context from previous conversations, such as chat track memory, enabling them to perform subsequent tasks based on past interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. Short-term memory can retain contextual memory for the last 100 inferences, and long-term memory is also possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>.
*   **Tool Calling**: Enables [[key_features_and_applications_of_ai_agents | AI agents]] to interact with external APIs for tasks like posting on social media or retrieving real-time data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.
*   **Function Calling**: Allows agents to execute custom functions tailored to unique requirements, enhancing versatility by generating structured outputs and performing function executions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.
*   **Security and Human-in-the-Loop**:
    *   **Human-in-the-Loop**: Involves human moderation and oversight to ensure accuracy and appropriateness before actions are executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. This feature aids in collaborative decision-making and improves efficiency for complex tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.
    *   **Responsible AI**: Includes features like context relevance to maintain conversation focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>, accuracy grounding to ensure responses are based on provided context and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>, and reflection to improve accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>.
    *   **Safe AI**: Incorporates fairness and bias reduction, and toxicity checks to prevent harmful content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>.

This article explores a specific use case for [[using_pieces_copilot_for_coding_assistance | Pieces Copilot]], demonstrating how its "Live Context" feature can overcome limitations of [[using_ai_models_for_coding_assistance | AI models for coding assistance]] that may not be aware of recent or niche information.

## The Challenge with Newer Frameworks
When [[using_pieces_copilot_for_coding_assistance | Pieces Copilot]] is used with a model like GPT-4o LM, it might not have knowledge of recently open-sourced frameworks or specific topics. For instance, when asked "What is MuP?", a Python-based UI framework, the copilot initially provides an incorrect definition, identifying "MuP" as "management Equity stock option plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. This indicates that the [[using_ai_models_for_coding_assistance | AI model]] lacks information about the specific framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

## Solution: Pieces Live Context
To address this knowledge gap, [[using_pieces_copilot_for_coding_assistance | Pieces Copilot]] offers a feature called "Live Context" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

### Activating Live Context
1.  Create a new chat in [[using_pieces_copilot_for_coding_assistance | Pieces Copilot]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.
2.  Turn on the "Live Context" feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.
3.  Ensure "WP W" (Workstream Pattern) is also enabled, as it is an algorithm and feature running with [[using_pieces_copilot_for_coding_assistance | Pieces]] that allows Live Context to function properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.

### Providing Context
Once Live Context is turned on, the user can scroll through a webpage containing the relevant information for a few seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. [[using_pieces_copilot_for_coding_assistance | Pieces Copilot]] will then automatically pick up the necessary context from the viewed content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. "WP W" observes everything the user scrolls through on the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

## Successful Outcome
After the Live Context is established by scrolling through the MuP framework's documentation, asking the same question ("What is MuP?") to [[using_pieces_copilot_for_coding_assistance | Pieces Copilot]] yields the correct answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>:

> MuP is a Python-based framework designed to rapidly build web applications such as demos and internal apps. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>

Furthermore, the copilot can then answer follow-up questions, such as "How to set up and install MuP?", providing a step-by-step solution including Python installation, MuP installation, adding files/code, and running the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

This demonstrates how [[using_pieces_copilot_for_coding_assistance | Pieces Live Context]] enables the copilot to gather specific, real-time information, significantly enhancing its capability to assist with current and specialized topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

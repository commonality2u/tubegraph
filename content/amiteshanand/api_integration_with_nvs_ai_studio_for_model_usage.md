[[API and model integration with Nebius AI Studio | Nebius AI Studio]] is utilized to access various AI models through API keys, enabling functionalities such as code explanation and translation within applications like a VS Code extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14">[01:13:14]</a>. The platform offers models for development and side projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:21">[01:41:21]</a>.

## Accessing Models via API Keys

To use the models provided by [[API and model integration with Nebius AI Studio | Nebius AI Studio]], users need to obtain API keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14">[01:13:14]</a>. These keys are pasted into the application (e.g., a VS Code extension's chat interface) to enable interaction with the selected models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:26">[01:25:26]</a>. Logging in to [[API and model integration with Nebius AI Studio | Nebius AI Studio]] is required to retrieve these API keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:44">[01:28:44]</a>.

## Available Models

The VS Code extension demonstrates the use of several models from [[API and model integration with Nebius AI Studio | Nebius AI Studio]], including:
*   Deep Seek model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>
*   Quin model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>
*   DC Coder V2 Light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:38">[03:08:38]</a>
*   Quin 2.5 Coders (7B and 32B instruct) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:53">[01:20:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:18">[02:02:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:08">[02:29:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:40">[07:41:40]</a>
*   Deep Seek B3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:20">[01:22:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:35">[06:07:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:38">[07:48:38]</a>

While Deep Seek B3 can be used, it may take longer to provide answers compared to other models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:15">[07:49:15]</a>.

## Benefits of Nebius AI Studio

[[API and model integration with Nebius AI Studio | Nebius AI Studio]] is described as a "cheaper inference provider" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:22">[08:18:22]</a>. Users who sign up receive credits, such as a dollar's worth of credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:03">[01:44:03]</a> and potentially coupon codes for additional credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:26">[08:24:26]</a>. This platform simplifies [[API and model integration with Nebius AI Studio | API and model integration]] for developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:30">[08:13:30]</a>.

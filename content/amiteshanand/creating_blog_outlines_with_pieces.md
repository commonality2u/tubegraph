Pieces is a versatile tool that can be used by content creators, not just coders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Its use cases extend beyond development and programming to include [[creating_content_online | content creation]], similar to how tools like ChatGPT are used for writing newsletters or planning articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## How Pieces Aids Content Creation

Pieces Desktop, combined with its [[live_context_feature_in_pieces_for_developers | Live Context]] feature, can be utilized to generate and complete blog outlines and articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Step-by-Step Example

1.  **Initiating an Outline:** A prompt is given to Pieces to "write article around Pieces for Developers SDK create a blog outline" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This was refined to "create a blog outline for how to use Pieces for Developers SDK to build AI apps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
2.  **Outline Generation:** Pieces provides an initial blog outline, including sections like "Introduction," "Getting Started with Pieces for Developers," "Installing Pieces for Developers SDK," and "Understanding the Core Components" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
3.  **Leveraging [[live_context_feature_in_pieces_for_developers | Live Context]]:**
    *   To enable Pieces (using GPT-4 LM internally) to write a full blog, the [[live_context_feature_in_pieces_for_developers | Live Context]] feature is activated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
    *   The user scrolls through Pieces for Developers SDK documentation and example projects for a few seconds to provide context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This includes documentation on SDK options like TypeScript, Python, and C# <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, and SDK capabilities such as co-pilot chats, asset management, and cloud/local LLM support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   Example projects built with Pieces SDK, like a C# tool and a React example project, are also scrolled through to gather information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
4.  **Completing the Blog:** After providing context, the user asks Pieces to "complete the full blog" using the new information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Pieces incorporates details from the scrolled web pages, including documentation on how to use and install the SDK, to fill out sections like the "opening book" and "introduction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
5.  **Querying Specific [[features_of_pieces_sdk_for_content_creation | Features]]:** The user can then ask more specific questions, such as "can you list features of Pieces SDK?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### Example of Features Listed by Pieces

When asked to list [[features_of_pieces_sdk_for_content_creation | features of Pieces SDK]], the tool can identify capabilities such as:

*   Model deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>
*   Data collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>

## How it Works

[[pieces_live_context_feature | Live Context]] functions in conjunction with the "workstream pattern engine," which operates continuously in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This enables the tool to monitor and recall a user's activities.

## Summarizing Recent Activity

The tool can quickly provide a summary of recent actions. For instance, it can report on the use of OBS Studio for recording streams or videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. It also tracks browser activity, such as watching YouTube videos on Mozilla Firefox, including specific videos like "par by B" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Additionally, [[pieces_live_context_feature | Live Context]] can identify and recall reading specific content, such as a tech-related newsletter titled "job hunt all things St" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. It effectively picks up on actions within applications like OBS Studio and web browsers like Mozilla Firefox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

It can identify specific articles browsed, such as "100 free front end challenges," which are often tagged with categories like [[web_development_tools | web]] and [[Website design tools | days]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

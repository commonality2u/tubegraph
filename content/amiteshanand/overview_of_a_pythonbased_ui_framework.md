This article provides an overview of Mup (sometimes referred to as Mop), a [[programming_basics_and_language_options | Python]]-based UI framework, and demonstrates how its information can be accessed and utilized even when not initially known by large language models (LLMs) via the Pieces Live Context feature.

## What is Mup?

Mup is a [[programming_basics_and_language_options | Python]]-based UI framework designed for rapidly building web applications, including demos and internal tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. It has been recently open-sourced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## The Challenge with New Frameworks and LLMs

Due to its recent open-source release, many LLMs, such as GPT-4o LM, may not have Mup (or "Mop") within their knowledge base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. When asked, an LLM might provide an incorrect or irrelevant definition, such as mistaking "Mop" for "Management Equity Stock Option Plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Leveraging Pieces Live Context for Enhanced Knowledge

To overcome the knowledge gap for recently released or niche topics like Mup, the Pieces Live Context feature can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### How Pieces Live Context Works

1.  **Enable Live Context**: Within Pieces Copilot, start a new chat and turn on the "Live Context" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
2.  **Activate Work Stream Pattern (WSP)**: Ensure that "WSP" (Work Stream Pattern) is also enabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. WSP is an algorithm or feature running with PCOS that allows Live Context to function properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
3.  **Provide Context**: Scroll through a webpage or document containing information about the topic (e.g., Mup's official documentation). Pieces Copilot's WSP will observe the content being viewed and extract relevant context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Results with Live Context

After providing context, Pieces Copilot can accurately define Mup as a [[programming_basics_and_language_options | Python]]-based UI framework for building web applications, demos, and internal apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

It can also provide [[stepbystep_guide_to_setting_up_a_python_project | instructions]] for setting up and installing Mup, which typically involves:
*   [[programming_basics_and_language_options | Python]] installation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>
*   Installing Mup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>
*   Adding necessary files and code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>
*   Running the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>

By utilizing Pieces Live Context, users can enable Pieces Copilot to understand and answer questions about specific, often obscure, or newly introduced topics effectively, maximizing its capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

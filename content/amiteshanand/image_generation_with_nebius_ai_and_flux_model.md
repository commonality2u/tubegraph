Image generation, specifically text-to-image generation, can be seamlessly [[integrating_ai_tools_for_content_and_image_generation | integrated into AI applications]] using Nebius AI Studio and the Flux model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:38">[02:31:38]</a>. This capability allows applications to create visual content based on descriptive text.

## Application Context: Star Wars Planet Search
In a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) application designed to find similar planets in the Star Wars universe, image generation plays a key role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:34">[01:07:34]</a>. After identifying planets similar to a user's query, the application can generate an image of the queried planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:44">[02:23:44]</a>. For example, when searching for planets similar to Alderaan, the application generates an image based on Alderaan's characteristics, such as mountains, grasslands, and temperate climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:18">[03:02:18]</a>.

## Leveraging Nebius AI Studio and the Flux Model
The image generation functionality is powered by Nebius AI Studio, which provides access to various state-of-the-art open-source models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:04">[03:33:04]</a>.

*   **Nebius AI Studio Features**: Nebius AI Studio offers a range of models, including text generation models (like Deeps V3 and R1) and text-to-image models such as Flux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:09">[03:38:09]</a>. It also includes vision models for image description and embedding models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
*   **Flux Model**: For text-to-image generation, the Flux model is utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:38">[02:31:38]</a>. Flux is described as one of the best available models for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:58">[03:47:58]</a>. It is an open-source model available through Nebius AI Studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:42">[09:19:42]</a>.
*   **Integration**: Users can interact with these models through a playground for quick testing and leverage their inbuilt Python and JavaScript SDKs using an API key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:19">[04:00:19]</a>.

## Implementation Details
The process of generating an image involves:
1.  **Prompt Engineering**: A specific prompt is given to the Flux model to generate the image. For instance, the prompt used is: "have a beautiful detailed illustration of that particular planet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:54">[07:19:54]</a>.
2.  **Model Invocation**: The Flux `chel` model is called to generate the image based on the generated text description of the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:51">[07:23:51]</a>.
3.  **Rendering**: Once the image is generated, the application renders it on the user interface alongside the textual response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:44">[08:08:44]</a>.

This [[integration_of_nebius_ai_for_advanced_ai_functionalities | integration of Nebius AI]] and the Flux model enables dynamic visual content creation within applications, enhancing the user experience by providing relevant imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:44">[02:23:44]</a>.

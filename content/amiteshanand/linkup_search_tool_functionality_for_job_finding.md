Linkup is a specialized search tool designed for [[ai_tools_for_productivity | AI applications]] that enables the integration of search capabilities into LLM-based applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. It serves as a key component in a demo application designed to help users find jobs by analyzing their resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Role in the Job Finding Application

In the described job finding application, Linkup is utilized to search for job postings specifically on Hacker News and Wellfound. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. This tool is integrated into a multi-agent system built using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### Key Features and Implementation

*   **Integration with AI Apps**: Linkup is developed to add search functionality specifically for AI and LLM-based applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Search Tool Definition**: Within the Google ADK framework, a "Linkup search tool" is defined to perform job searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This involves providing a Linkup API key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   **Site Restrictions**: The implementation explicitly restricts searches to only Hacker News and Wellfound, preventing it from searching random web pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This ensures more accurate and relevant results for job seekers.
*   **Deep Search Capability**: Linkup supports both general and "deep search" functionalities. The deep search option is chosen for this application as it yields better accuracy and allows for picking up larger contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Query Generation and Passage**: Queries for Linkup are dynamically generated by an agent (`query prep agent`) based on the extracted resume content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This agent generates up to five precise search queries focusing on specific job goals, skills, experience, or technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   **Sequential Agent Workflow**: Linkup is a crucial part of the sequential agent workflow as the third agent (`linkup search agent`). This agent uses the generated queries to perform the actual job search via the `link up deep search` tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. It is instructed to prioritize the most recent and latest job links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   **Multiple Searches**: Due to the design of generating five search queries, Linkup performs five distinct searches, leading to more comprehensive results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.
*   **Result Filtering**: The results from Linkup are then processed by a final agent (`job filter agent`) which compiles and formats relevant job postings, optionally prioritizing them based on experience level and chance of selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

Pieces Live Context is a tool designed to help users summarize their work, whether it was done moments ago or over the past week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This functionality is enabled by having the "Live Context" and "Work Stream Pattern Engine" turned on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## How Pieces Live Context Works

Pieces Live Context operates by recalling and detailing activities the user has performed. It can provide summaries based on specific timeframes or content types, offering a broad overview of recent work or specific details about consumed content.

## Use Cases for Activity Summarization

### Summarizing Recent Activity

Pieces Live Context can describe what the user was doing just a few minutes prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
For instance, when asked, it can identify activities such as:
*   Using OBS Studio for recording a video stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>
*   Browsing YouTube on Mozilla Firefox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   Having a video by "Par by B" open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>
*   Reading a tech-related newsletter titled "Job Hunt all things St" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>

> [!NOTE]
> This capability allows Pieces to pick up details from various applications, such as browser activity and recording software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Detailing Browser Activity

The tool can also provide a more detailed summary of activities performed within a browser, like Mozilla Firefox, for a specific day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Based on [[professional_workflow_improvements | workflow]] browsing, it can highlight:
*   Browsing the "dev.to Community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   Reading articles such as "100 free front end challenges" (tagged with web and days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
*   Viewing articles titled "Why my coffee pot is my best code reviewer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>
*   General activities like watching YouTube videos and reading newsletters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>

### Summarizing Specific Content

Pieces can summarize specific content that was recently viewed or read, such as a newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. For example, regarding the "Job Hunt all things St" newsletter identified in Mozilla Firefox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, Pieces can provide:
*   **Purpose:** To save knowledge and insights about authentic content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Content:** Each issue includes insights or writing context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Goal:** To deliver, teach, and share interesting and valuable information beyond daily encounters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Publication:** New issues are published on random days and weeks each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

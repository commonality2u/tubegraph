This article outlines the process of [[creating_a_repository_on_github|creating a new repository]] on GitHub, [[cloning_a_repository_using_github_desktop|cloning it to a local machine]], and then [[uploading_files_to_github_using_github_desktop|uploading files]] from a personal computer to the repository.

## Creating a Repository

To begin, a new repository can be created and linked to for future operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. For example, a new repository could be named "Renuka benefits of programming basics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Cloning a Repository

Once a repository is created, it can be cloned to a local machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This step allows for local management of files before [[uploading_files_to_github_using_github_desktop|uploading them to GitHub]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Adding and Uploading Files

Files can be added to the locally cloned repository. This involves placing the desired files, such as a "sea file," into the specific local folder associated with the cloned repository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Once the files are in the local folder, they can be uploaded to GitHub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

There are options to create or download files directly from the GitHub interface, but the described workflow focuses on local management and subsequent [[uploading_files_to_github_using_github_desktop|uploading from a PC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. After moving files into the local repository folder, such as a file referred to as "Nehru Park," they are then ready for synchronization with the remote GitHub repository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

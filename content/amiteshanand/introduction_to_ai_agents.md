AI agents are pieces of software or programs designed with specific instructions to perform particular tasks autonomously, learning and adapting to user needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. They take actions and execute tasks independently based on predefined inputs and instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

## [[difference_between_ai_agents_and_ai_chatbots | AI Agents vs. AI Chatbots]]

The primary distinction between an AI agent and an AI chatbot lies in their functionality:
*   **AI Chatbot**: A conversational interface that interacts with users through text or voice, often limited to predefined scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. Examples include ChatGPT or Gemini interfaces, used for generating results, transforming images, or retrieving information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.
*   **AI Agent**: A software entity capable of performing tasks autonomously, learning, and adapting to user needs based on predefined instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

## Structure and Key Components of AI Agents

[[applications_and_implementation_of_ai_agents | AI agents]] are built with key components that enable their operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>:
*   **Perception**: The ability to make API calls or receive data from users, going beyond simple task inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.
*   **Decision Making**: Utilizes an LLM (Large Language Model) or rule-based logic to process information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.
*   **Action**: Execution of tasks, generation of outputs, or enabling users to download results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

## [[types_and_features_of_ai_agents | Types of AI Agents]]

There are three main [[types_and_features_of_ai_agents | types of AI agents]]:
*   **Reactive Agents**: Simple rule-based systems, similar to chatbots, performing one or two tasks based on defined input and instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.
*   **Deliberative Agents**: Used for planning and reasoning. An example is an OpenAI researcher agent that performs web searches, extracts information, analyzes it with an LLM, and provides output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. These can also be multimodal agents that use multiple LLMs for different tasks, enabling multitasking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Agents**: A combination of reactive and deliberative agents, capable of performing both simple and complex tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

## [[types_and_features_of_ai_agents | Key Features of AI Agents]]

The [[types_and_features_of_ai_agents | features of AI agents]] can vary based on their purpose, whether for personal use or enterprise-level applications (e.g., coding assistance, documentation generation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

Common features include:
*   **Memory**: Agents can have chat-track memory or contextual memory, retaining context from previous conversations (e.g., the last 10 tasks) to inform future actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.
*   **Tool Calling / Function Calling**: Enables AI agents to interact with external APIs (e.g., for social media posting, real-time data retrieval) or execute custom functions tailored to specific requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.
*   **Security and Human-in-the-Loop**:
    *   **Moderation and Oversight**: A human can be involved to measure agent performance, ensuring accuracy and appropriateness before actions are executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.
    *   **Collaborative Decision Making**: Human judgment can enhance AI efficiency for complex tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.
    *   **Responsible AI**: Includes options for context relevance, accuracy grounded in provided knowledge, reflection to improve responses, and safe AI measures like reducing biases and preventing toxic content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>.

## [[applications_and_implementation_of_ai_agents | Applications of AI Agents]]

Broad [[applications_and_implementation_of_ai_agents | applications of AI agents]] include business automation, visualized systems, and autonomous systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. At a basic level, an agent can be configured to send emails with predefined rules and instructions, requiring only human-like conversational input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

## Building AI Agents

AI agents can be built using various methods, including coding with SDKs or utilizing low-code platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

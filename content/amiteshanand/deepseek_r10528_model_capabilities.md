DeepSeek officially launched two new models, including [[deepseek_v3_and_r1_for_technical_content_evaluation | DeepSeek R10528]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Benchmarks and Performance
[[deepseek_v3_and_r1_for_technical_content_evaluation | DeepSeek R10528]] has demonstrated benchmark scores that are superior to Open AI's GPT-3, Google's GMI 2.5 Pro, [[qwen_3235b_a22b_model_comparison | Qwen 3235B]], and DeepSeek 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The model's reasoning capability was specifically highlighted and tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Availability
[[leveraging_nebas_ai_studio_for_open_source_model_access | Nebas AI Studio]] has hosted the [[deepseek_v3_and_r1_for_technical_content_evaluation | DeepSeek R10528]] model, making it available through their console <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Users can access [[using_deepseek_v3_and_r1_models_in_boltdiy | DeepSeek R10528]] within the Nebas console <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Model Comparison
[[deepseek_v3_and_r1_for_technical_content_evaluation | DeepSeek R10528]] was directly compared against the [[qwen_3235b_a22b_model_comparison | Qwen 3235B A22B model]] to assess its performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   When given a prompt designed to test reasoning capabilities, [[deepseek_v3_and_r1_for_technical_content_evaluation | DeepSeek R10528]] provided an answer after 91 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   In the same test, [[qwen_3235b_a22b_model_comparison | Qwen 3235B]] took 64 seconds to start generating a response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, but was still processing the request after [[deepseek_v3_and_r1_for_technical_content_evaluation | DeepSeek R10528]] had finished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   [[deepseek_v3_and_r1_for_technical_content_evaluation | DeepSeek R10528]] produced an answer closer to the correct solution (approximately 29) compared to [[qwen_3235b_a22b_model_comparison | Qwen 3235B]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

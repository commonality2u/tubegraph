This article demonstrates how to build an AI-powered job search application using various tools, primarily focusing on [[google_agent_development_kit | Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. The application allows users to upload their resume, which is then analyzed to find suitable job postings from Hacker News and Wellfound. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>

## Core Components and Tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>

The job finder app leverages a suite of advanced AI and search technologies:

*   **[[google_agent_development_kit | Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)]]**
    *   This framework is used to build the entire agent application, enabling the creation of complex workflows. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a> It supports the integration of various LLM providers via LiteLLM. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>
*   **Mr. OCR**
    *   An LLM-based model specialized in reading documents and images efficiently. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a> It performs better than other OCR models, with an overall benchmark score of 94.89 and a multilingual score of 99.0. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a> It is used to extract text from uploaded resumes in PDF format. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>
*   **[[utilizing_linkup_for_job_search_results | Linkup]]**
    *   A search tool designed for AI applications, allowing the addition of search functionality to LLM-based apps. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> It is used to perform job searches on platforms like Hacker News and Wellfound. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>
*   **[[introduction_to_qwen3_for_ai_and_job_search_functionality | Qwen3]]**
    *   Specifically, the [[introduction_to_qwen3_for_ai_and_job_search_functionality | Qwen3]] 34B model is utilized for the AI and LLM aspects of the agent. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a> It is noted for its "thinking capabilities" and strong performance, with the [[introduction_to_qwen3_for_ai_and_job_search_functionality | Qwen3]] 72B model being a top-performing open-source thinking model. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>
    *   [[introduction_to_qwen3_for_ai_and_job_search_functionality | Qwen3]] models are accessed via Navius AI Studio, which provides access to various lightweight and big-weight open-source models. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>

## Building the Multi-Agent System <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>

The application is set up using Google Colab for easy demonstration. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a> It employs a [[building_multiagent_systems_using_google_collab | multi-agent system]] with a [[sequential_agent_workflows | sequential agent workflow]] using [[google_agent_development_kit | Google ADK]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

### Workflow Overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>

The app's workflow consists of four sub-agents orchestrated by a host agent:

1.  **OCR Agent**:
    *   **Purpose**: Extracts plain text content from an uploaded PDF resume using the Mr. OCR tool. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>
    *   **Instructions**: Uses the Mr. OCR tool to extract text and returns only the plain text content, prefixed with "OCR". <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>
2.  **Query Prep Agent**:
    *   **Purpose**: Analyzes the extracted resume content (OCR output) and generates up to five precise search queries for job goals, skills, experience, or technologies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>
    *   **Instructions**: Targets Hacker News and Wellfound platforms and formats each query as a bullet point, prefixed with "Query Agent". <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>
3.  **Linkup Search Agent**:
    *   **Purpose**: Uses the [[utilizing_linkup_for_job_search_results | Linkup]] search tool to perform job searches based on the queries generated by the Query Prep Agent. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>
    *   **Instructions**: Restricts results to Hacker News and Wellfound, picks the most recent job links, and prefixes the response with "Linkup Search". A "deep search" is performed for better accuracy and context. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>
4.  **Job Filter Agent**:
    *   **Purpose**: Compiles, formats, and prioritizes a final list of suitable job postings based on the resume content and search results. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>
    *   **Instructions**: Includes job title, company, application link, and source. It prioritizes jobs based on the experience needed and higher chances of selection, prefixing the response with "Job Filter". <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>

### Orchestration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>

A "Job Finder" host agent, named "OCR Sequential Agent", is defined to manage the sequential execution of these four sub-agents, defining the overall workflow. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>

## Implementation and Execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>

The setup involves installing necessary libraries like `google-generative-agent`, `mixtral-4-m-ocr`, `python-dotenv`, `litellm`, and `linkup-sdk`. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a> API keys are configured, and the LLM (Qwen3) is set up via LiteLLM. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>

### Demo Walkthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>

Upon execution, the user is prompted to upload a PDF resume. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>

*   The OCR Agent processes the resume, displaying the extracted text, and the [[introduction_to_qwen3_for_ai_and_job_search_functionality | Qwen3]] model's "thinking" process (e.g., "think deeper act faster"). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>
*   The Query Prep Agent then analyzes the OCR output and generates five distinct job search queries. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>
*   The [[utilizing_linkup_for_job_search_results | Linkup]] Search Agent uses these queries to perform multiple searches on Hacker News and Wellfound, providing job links. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>
*   Finally, the Job Filter Agent compiles the results, filtering and prioritizing job links based on the resume's content and the likelihood of selection. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a> The agent also adds explanatory notes correlating job matches with resume projects and skills. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>

The [[utilizing_linkup_for_job_search_results | Linkup]] dashboard shows that the system performs five separate searches, one for each query generated, leading to better and more relevant results. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>

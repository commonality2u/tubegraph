The "Do You Know" app, also known as "Kya Aap Jante Ho" in Hindi, is an AI-powered application designed to provide interesting facts about objects or things from images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. It was built in under 10 minutes without coding any single line of code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Core Functionality
The primary feature of "Do You Know" is its ability to analyze uploaded or clicked images and generate facts about the objects or things depicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Image Analysis:** Users can upload any picture, and the app's AI will explain "cool interesting facts" about the subject of the image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
    *   **Example 1:** An image of a "Sue floating on water" generated by a Flux model was uploaded, and the app's AI explained it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
    *   **Example 2:** An image of the Statue of Liberty was uploaded, and the app identified it as an "iconic symbol of Freedom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
    *   **Example 3:** An image of the Red Fort (generated by Flux) was uploaded, and the app identified it as a "historic fortification in city of Delhi, India," "built by Mughal Emperor," and a "UNESCO world heritage site" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

## Technology Stack
The app was developed using a combination of AI tools:
*   **App Builder:** [[using_lovable_ai_app_builder | Lovable.ai]], an AI app builder, was used to create the application quickly by giving it prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **AI Features:** For its AI capabilities, "Do You Know" utilizes Quin Vision models provided by [[features_of_nebas_ai_studio | Nvus AI Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Specifically, the "P model" was used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Database Integration:** The app integrates with Superbase to store recent search history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This allows the app to display the "recent five searches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

## Development and Refinements
The initial version of the app was ready in under 10 minutes after providing a prompt to Lovable.ai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Subsequent modifications included:
*   Image analysis updates using the Vision API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   Improvements to features and User Interface (UI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   Setup of Superbase to store the five most recent searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   Improvements to rendering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

### Future Enhancements
The developer plans to add more features to the app, including:
*   OAuth integration for user authentication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   A "streak" feature, similar to Snapchat or Duolingo, to help users track their learning history (e.g., what they learned today and yesterday) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

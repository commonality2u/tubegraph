This video introduces a "Kas generator" (likely referring to [[css_generators | CSS Generators]]) as a tool to enhance [[creating_website_designs | website design]] and make websites appear more aesthetically pleasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Such tools can help make a website "cool looking" and "beautiful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Applying and Mixing Colors

Users can apply colors directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The generator allows for the creation of color mixtures, enabling users to combine colors to achieve desired effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Exporting Color Choices

Once a color or color mixture is selected, it can be copied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The process of "exporting" the chosen colors involves copying them, making them ready for use in the website's design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

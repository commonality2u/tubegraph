This article demonstrates the functionality of the [[live_context_feature_in_pieces_for_developers | Pieces Live Context]] feature within Pieces for Developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Initial Query Without Live Context

The demonstration begins by posing a question about "MOP," a recently open-sourced, Python-based UI framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Since MOP is new, large language models (LLMs) might not be aware of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

When asked "What is MOP?" using GPT-4o via Pieces Copilot, the initial response was incorrect, identifying MOP as "management Equity Stock Option Plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This confirmed that the LLM did not have the specific knowledge in its base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Enabling Pieces Live Context

To get the correct answer, the [[live_context_feature_in_pieces_for_developers | Pieces Live Context]] feature is utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Steps to Enable

1.  Create a new chat in Pieces Copilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
2.  Turn on [[live_context_feature_in_pieces_for_developers | Live Context]] as a context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
3.  Ensure "WSP" (Workstream Pattern) is also activated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Understanding WSP

WSP is an algorithm and feature that runs with Pieces to ensure [[live_context_feature_in_pieces_for_developers | Live Context]] functions properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. It actively monitors and "sees" everything the user scrolls through on their screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Demonstration with Live Context

After enabling [[live_context_feature_in_pieces_for_developers | Live Context]] and WSP, the user scrolls through a webpage containing information about MOP for a few seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Pieces Copilot then picks up the relevant context from this interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Corrected Initial Query

When the same question, "What is MOP?", is asked again with [[live_context_feature_in_pieces_for_developers | Live Context]] active, Pieces Copilot provides the correct definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>:

> MOP is a Python-based framework designed to rapidly build web applications such as demos and internal apps. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>

### Follow-up Question

A follow-up question, "How to set up and install MOP?", was then asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Pieces Copilot successfully provided a step-by-step solution, including Python installation, MOP installation, file addition, and running the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Conclusion

This demonstration illustrates how [[live_context_feature_in_pieces_for_developers | Pieces Live Context]] can effectively pick up contextual information from a user's interaction with their screen, enabling Pieces Copilot to provide accurate and relevant answers, thereby maximizing its capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

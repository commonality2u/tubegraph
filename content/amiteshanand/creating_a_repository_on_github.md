This article outlines the process of creating a new repository on GitHub and linking it with GitHub Desktop for local management and file [[uploading_files_to_github_using_github_desktop | uploads]].

## Initial Setup and Creation

The process begins by creating a new repository and linking it, potentially through [[cloning_a_repository_using_github_desktop | GitHub Desktop]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. A new repository is created, and it is given a name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Example names mentioned include "Renuka benefits of programming basics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, "arming basics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, "programming basics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, and "basic course of videos programming and language" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Managing Files and Directories

Instead of creating or downloading files directly from the GitHub web interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, the preferred method is to manage files locally using [[online_tools_for_software_development | GitHub Desktop]].

### Cloning the Repository

After creating the repository on GitHub, it needs to be [[cloning_a_repository_using_github_desktop | cloned]] to a local folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This creates a local copy of the repository on your computer.

### Adding Local Files

Once the repository is [[cloning_a_repository_using_github_desktop | cloned]], files can be added to the local folder. For example, a "sea file" is mentioned as being added to the local directory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This allows for local editing and organization before [[uploading_files_to_github_using_github_desktop | uploading]] to GitHub.

### Uploading and Syncing Changes

After files are added or modified locally, they can be uploaded and synchronized with the remote GitHub repository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The changes made locally in the cloned folder are detected by GitHub Desktop, and then committed and pushed to update the online repository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This action ensures that the changes are reflected on the GitHub profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

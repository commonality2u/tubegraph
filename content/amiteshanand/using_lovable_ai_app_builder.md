Lovable is an AI app builder that allows users to create applications quickly without writing a single line of code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. It leverages AI to generate full app functionality from simple text prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Core Capabilities
*   **Prompt-based App Creation**: Users provide a prompt, and Lovable creates the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **CRUD Operations**: It can handle basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Database Integration**: Lovable allows connection with Supabase for database management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Project Export and Deployment**: Projects can be exported via Git and published or deployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Real-time Updates**: The app updates in real-time as modifications or refinements are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

## How it Works
The process of [[building_an_aipowered_app_without_coding | building an AI-powered app without coding]] using Lovable typically involves:
1.  **Providing a Prompt**: Giving a command describing the desired app, such as "create a note paper with lean minimalist UI save quick notes on web page" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
2.  **App Generation**: Lovable generates the app and its underlying code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
3.  **Refinement and Modification**: Users can give additional prompts to refactor the code or add more features, such as image analysis or a Supabase setup to store search history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
4.  **Connecting APIs**: For AI features, Lovable can integrate with external AI models and APIs, such as NVS AI Studio's Vision models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

### Example: "Do You Know" App
An app called "Do You Know" was built using Lovable to identify objects from uploaded images and provide interesting facts about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This app was built in less than 10 minutes from the initial prompt to a ready state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. It utilized NVS AI Studio's Vision models for its AI capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Further enhancements included a Supabase setup to store the five most recent searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

## Pricing
Lovable offers a free plan that provides five messaging credits daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Paid plans are available for approximately $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

The [[deepseek_and_qwen_models_in_development | Qwen]] 3235B A22B model has been part of comparative analyses against other advanced AI models, specifically [[deepseek_r10528_model_capabilities | DeepSeek R10528]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Benchmarking Context

In initial [[benchmarking_ai_models | benchmark]] scores, the [[deepseek_and_qwen_models_in_development | Qwen]] 3235B model was noted to have lower performance than other models like OpenAI O3, GMI 2.5 Pro, and [[deepseek_and_qwen_models_in_development | DeepSeek]] R1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Comparison Setup

A comparison was conducted using the [[comparing_ai_models_using_nebius_ai_studio | Nebius AI Studio]] console, where [[deepseek_r10528_model_capabilities | DeepSeek R10528]] was selected for comparison against the [[deepseek_and_qwen_models_in_development | Qwen]] 3235B A22B model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. A specific prompt, considered effective for checking reasoning capability, was submitted to both models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Performance Analysis

*   **Processing Time:** Both models began processing simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The [[deepseek_and_qwen_models_in_development | Qwen]] 3235B model thought for 64-65 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a> and 64 seconds specifically to provide an answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. In contrast, [[deepseek_r10528_model_capabilities | DeepSeek R10528]] took 91 seconds to provide its answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Answer Accuracy:** For the given reasoning prompt, the correct answer was approximately 29 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
    *   [[deepseek_r10528_model_capabilities | DeepSeek R10528]] came closer to the correct answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
    *   The [[deepseek_and_qwen_models_in_development | Qwen]] 3235B model was "a bit far" from the correct answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

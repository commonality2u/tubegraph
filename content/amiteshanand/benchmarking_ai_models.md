Recently, Deepseek launched two new AI models, including Deepseek R10528 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This new model boasts a benchmark score superior to OpenAI O3, GMI 2.5 Pro, Qwen 3235B, and Deepseek R1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Benchmarking Process with Nebius AI Studio

Deepseek R10528 has been hosted on Nebius AI Studio, making it available for [[leveraging_nebas_ai_studio_for_open_source_model_access | access]] and comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The Nebius console confirms the availability of Deepseek R10528 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

To demonstrate [[comparing_ai_models_using_nebius_ai_studio | model comparison]], Deepseek R10528 was pitted against the Qwen 3235B A22B model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The comparison was initiated through the "go to playground" feature and the "compare" option within Nebius AI Studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

### Reasoning Capability Test

A specific prompt was utilized, considered optimal for testing the [[reasoning_capability_test_for_ai_models | reasoning capability]] of AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Upon submission, both Deepseek R10528 and Qwen 3235B began processing the request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Performance Comparison

During the test, both models took over a minute to process the query <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

*   **Deepseek R10528** thought for 91 seconds before providing an answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Qwen 3235B** was still processing after Deepseek R10528 delivered its response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

The correct answer to the given question was approximately 29 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
In the comparison, Deepseek R10528 processed the query in 91 seconds, while Qwen 3 took 464 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. Deepseek's answer was closer to the correct value, whereas Qwen's response was further off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>.

This article outlines how to manage files with a local repository linked to GitHub, inferring the process of cloning for local management.

## Creating a New Repository
Before managing files locally, you might first [[creating_a_repository_on_github | create a new repository]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Linking and Managing Files Locally
The process involves creating a repository and then "taking a loan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, which likely refers to cloning or setting up a local link to a GitHub repository. Once linked, you can [[uploading_files_to_github_using_github_desktop | upload files from your PC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Instead of creating or downloading files directly through the GitHub web interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, you would manage them locally.

## Adding Files to the Local Repository
To [[managing_files_and_directories_on_github | manage files and directories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, you can place files, such as a "sea file," into the specified local folder that corresponds to the repository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. After moving files, the system registers them, and you can confirm their presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. You can also view the uploaded files within the repository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

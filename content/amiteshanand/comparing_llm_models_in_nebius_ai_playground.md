[[Features of Nebas AI Studio|Nebius AI Studio]] offers a playground feature that allows users to compare different large language models (LLMs) and assess their performance for various use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. This platform functions as an inference provider for AI, allowing access to multiple open LLMs such as Quin DC 5, Mistral, Meta Llama, and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. It includes a wide range of models, including text-to-text, embedding, and text-to-image models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

## Accessing the Playground

The [[API and model integration with Nebius AI Studio|Nebius AI Studio]] playground is accessible via the platform's API documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. Users can navigate to the playground, select models, and adjust parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>.

## Comparing Vision Models

The playground facilitates the comparison of vision models to determine their performance. For example, to compare image generation capabilities, one can select models like Flux Dev and Stable Diffusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

*   **Process**:
    1.  Select "Vision models" in the playground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.
    2.  Click the "compare" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.
    3.  Choose models for comparison, such as Flux Dev and Stable Diffusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.
    4.  Enter a prompt, e.g., "an image of Eiffel Tower on Mars" or "a boy dancing underwater" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.
    5.  Observe the generated images to compare performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. For instance, Flux has been noted to perform well in generating images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

## Comparing Text-to-Text Models

Similar to vision models, [[Text and image generation using Nebius AI models|text-to-text models]] can be compared in the playground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.

*   **Process**:
    1.  Select desired text-to-text models, such as Meta Llama 3.18B Instruct and 25 2.5 Coder 7B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.
    2.  Provide a prompt, e.g., "explain me a basic JavaScript code with example" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.
    3.  Analyze the responses to evaluate clarity, completeness, and formatting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. Meta Llama, for example, might provide explanations and instructions on how to run code, while other models might generate different examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

## Playground Features

Beyond direct comparison, the [[Features of Nebas AI Studio|Nebius AI Studio]] playground offers additional functionalities:

*   **System Prompts and Parameters**: Users can add system prompts and set various parameters to fine-tune model behavior during testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>.
*   **Code Access**: The playground allows users to copy the generated API code (in Python, cURL, or JavaScript) for direct integration into their applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. This code is formatted according to OpenAI standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.
*   **Model Selection**: Users can choose between fast or base models for their comparisons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>.

## Benefits of Using Nebius AI Playground

Utilizing the [[API and model integration with Nebius AI Studio|Nebius AI Studio]] playground provides several advantages:

*   **Model Selection**: It helps identify which model performs best for a specific use case before embedding it into a project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness**: [[API integration with nvs AI Studio for model usage|Nebius AI Studio]] is presented as a more affordable option for AI model usage compared to other providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>.
*   **Free Credits**: Users can receive free credits upon signing up, making it easier to experiment with models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.

The [[live_context_tool_for_developers | Pieces Live Context]] feature enhances the capability of [[using_pieces_copilot_for_coding_assistance | Pieces Copilot]] by providing it with real-time context from the user's active workspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This is particularly useful when dealing with new or obscure information that Large Language Models (LLMs) might not have in their pre-trained knowledge base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Problem Solved: LLM Knowledge Gaps

When querying an LLM like GP4o about a recently open-sourced framework, such as Mup (a Python-based UI framework), the LLM might provide an incorrect or irrelevant answer because it's unaware of the specific technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. For instance, without [[live_context_tool_for_developers | live context]], [[using_pieces_copilot_for_coding_assistance | Pieces Copilot]] might interpret "Mup" as "Management Equity Stock Option Plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Activating Live Context

To utilize the [[live_context_tool_for_developers | Live Context]] feature:
1.  Create a new chat within [[using_pieces_copilot_for_coding_assistance | Pieces Copilot]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
2.  Toggle on the "live context" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
3.  Ensure "WSP" (Work Stream Pattern) is also enabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. WSP is an algorithm that runs with Pieces to allow [[live_context_tool_for_developers | live context]] to function properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## How it Works

Once activated, the WSP algorithm continuously observes the user's screen activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. By simply scrolling through a relevant web page or document for a few seconds, [[using_pieces_copilot_for_coding_assistance | Pieces Copilot]] will automatically pick up the necessary context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This dynamic retrieval of information enables the LLM to provide accurate and relevant answers based on the currently viewed content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Demonstration

After enabling [[live_context_tool_for_developers | Live Context]] and scrolling through documentation about Mup, [[using_pieces_copilot_for_coding_assistance | Pieces Copilot]] can correctly identify Mup as a Python-based framework designed for rapidly building web applications, demos, and internal apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Furthermore, it can provide detailed, step-by-step instructions for setting up and installing Mup, including Python installation, Mup installation, file/code setup, and running the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

The [[live_context_tool_for_developers | Pieces Live Context]] feature significantly enhances the capabilities of [[using_pieces_copilot_for_coding_assistance | Pieces Copilot]], allowing it to leverage real-time information for more accurate and comprehensive assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

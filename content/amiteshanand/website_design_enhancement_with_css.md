Enhancing [[creating_website_designs | website designs]] to appear "cool looking" and "beautiful" can be achieved with the help of [[css_generators | CSS Generators]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. These tools aid in making a website more aesthetically pleasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Color Management for Design

A significant aspect of design enhancement through [[css_generators | CSS Generators]] is the robust functionality for managing colors, which is a core part of [[color_mixing_and_exporting_in_web_design | color mixing and exporting in web design]]:
*   Users can apply colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   Colors can be copied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   It is possible to create a mixture of two colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   Selected or mixed colors can then be exported by copying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Layout and Positioning

Beyond color, such tools also offer capabilities to manipulate website layout and positioning, including the ability to "expand the website" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a> and "put it on top" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

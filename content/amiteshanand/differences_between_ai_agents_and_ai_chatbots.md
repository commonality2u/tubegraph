This article explores the fundamental differences between [[understanding_ai_agents | AI agents]] and AI chatbots, their structures, types, features, and applications. The discussion draws insights from a video demonstrating how to [[building_ai_agents_with_openai_agent_sdk | build AI agents]] using both code-based frameworks and low-code platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## AI Chatbot Defined

An AI chatbot is a conversational interface that primarily interacts with users through text or voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. These chatbots are often limited to predefined scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Examples include interfaces like RGB or Gemini, where users might upload pictures, request result generation, image transformation, or seek specific information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## AI Agent Defined

An [[understanding_ai_agents | AI agent]] is a piece of software or program designed and set up with specific instructions to perform a particular task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. As a software entity, an [[understanding_ai_agents | AI agent]] can perform tasks autonomously, learning and adapting to user needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. They take actions and execute tasks independently based on predefined inputs and instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Key Differences

The primary distinction lies in their capabilities and autonomy:
*   **AI Chatbots** are conversational interfaces, limited to predefined scripts and typically interact to provide information or transform data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   **[[understanding_ai_agents | AI agents]]** are autonomous software entities that can perform tasks by themselves, learning and adapting to user needs based on predefined instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. They go beyond simple interaction to execute actions and perform tasks autonomously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Understanding AI Agent Structure and Applications

[[understanding_ai_agents | AI agents]] are built with key components that enable their autonomous operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>:
*   **Perception:** [[understanding_ai_agents | AI agents]] can make API calls or take data from users, allowing for more complex data intake beyond simple tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Decision Making:** This component typically uses a Large Language Model (LLM) or rule-based logic to decide on actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Action:** Based on decisions, [[understanding_ai_agents | AI agents]] can execute tasks, generate outputs, or enable users to download results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### Types of AI Agents

There are three main types of [[understanding_ai_agents | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>:
1.  **Reactive Agents:** These are simple rule-based systems, similar to chatbots, performing one or two tasks based on defined inputs and instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
2.  **Deliberative Agents:** Used for planning and reasoning, an example is an "open DP researcher" that performs web searches, extracts information, analyzes it with an LLM, and provides output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Multimodal agents also fall into this category, using different LLMs to perform various multitasking operations based on predefined instructions and rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
3.  **Hybrid Agents:** A combination of reactive and deliberative agents, capable of handling both simple and complex tasks depending on their design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Applications of AI Agents

[[understanding_ai_agents | AI agents]] have broad applications including <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>:
*   Business automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>
*   Visualized systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>
*   Autonomous systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>

On a basic level, an [[understanding_ai_agents | AI agent]] can be instructed to send emails based on defined rules and a simple human conversation input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## [[key_features_and_applications_of_ai_agents | Key Features of AI Agents]]

The features of an [[understanding_ai_agents | AI agent]] depend on its purpose, whether for personal work or enterprise use cases like coding assistance or documentation generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

### Memory
[[understanding_ai_agents | AI agents]] can possess memory, such as chat track memory, retaining context from previous conversations. This allows the agent to perform subsequent tasks based on the context and memory from earlier interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Lizer.ai agents can retain contextual memory for the last 100 inferences, with options for both short-term and long-term memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

### Tool Calling and Function Calling
*   **Tool Calling:** Enables [[understanding_ai_agents | AI agents]] to interact with external APIs for tasks such as posting on social media platforms or retrieving real-time data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **Function Calling:** Allows for custom function execution, performing specific operations tailored to unique requirements and enhancing versatility, such as generating structured outputs or executing functions during a process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

### Security and Human-in-the-Loop
[[understanding_ai_agents | AI agents]] are increasingly incorporating features for security and human oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop:** Involves human moderation and oversight to measure agent performance, ensuring accuracy and appropriateness before actions are executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. This helps improve [[understanding_ai_agents | AI agent]] efficiency for complex tasks through collaborative decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Responsible AI:** Options include context relevance (maintaining conversation context), accuracy (grounding responses in provided context and knowledge), and reflection (enabling agents to reflect on responses to improve accuracy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.
*   **Safe AI:** Features like fairness and bias reduction, toxicity checks, and prompt injection detection are crucial for building robust and secure [[understanding_ai_agents | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

## Building AI Agents

[[understanding_ai_agents | AI agents]] can be built using various frameworks and platforms:

### Code-Based Frameworks
Developers can build [[understanding_ai_agents | AI agents]] from scratch using SDKs such as:
*   [[building_ai_agents_with_openai_agent_sdk | OpenAI Agent SDK]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>

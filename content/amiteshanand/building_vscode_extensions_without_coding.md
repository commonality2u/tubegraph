This article explores the process of creating a VS Code extension primarily through AI prompting, leveraging tools like [[utilizing_cursor_for_vscode_extension_creation | Cursor]] and [[live_context_tool_for_developers | NVS AI Studio]] for model inference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The demonstrated method allows for the development of extensions with minimal manual coding, focusing on prompt-based iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Overview
A basic VS Code extension was developed using [[utilizing_cursor_for_vscode_extension_creation | Cursor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This extension incorporates [[live_context_tool_for_developers | DeepSeek]] and [[live_context_tool_for_developers | Quin]] AI models to assist with coding tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The entire codebase for the extension was generated by Cursor based on a single initial prompt and subsequent iterative prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The repository for this extension is publicly available for those interested in trying or improving it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Development Process Using Cursor
The core of the development relied on [[utilizing_cursor_for_vscode_extension_creation | Cursor]]:
*   **Prompt-Driven Generation** The speaker provided an initial prompt to [[utilizing_cursor_for_vscode_extension_creation | Cursor]], which then generated the entire code for the extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Iterative Refinement** Further prompts were used to iterate on and improve the extension's functionality and user interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Using the Extension
To run and interact with the developed VS Code extension:
1.  **Compile and Run** After compiling the project (e.g., `npm run compile`), the extension can be launched within a VS Code development host server by pressing `F5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
2.  **Accessing the Extension** Once the development host is active, users can access the "Deep Coin Coded Chat" functionality by pressing `Command + Shift + P` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
3.  **API Key Configuration** An API key is required to use the AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This key is obtained from [[integration_of_nv_studio_and_boltdiy | NVS AI Studio]], which hosts the utilized [[live_context_tool_for_developers | DeepSeek]] Coder V2 light, [[live_context_tool_for_developers | Quin]] 2.5 coders, and [[live_context_tool_for_developers | DeepSeek]] V3 models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. [[integration_of_nv_studio_and_boltdiy | NVS AI Studio]] provides initial credit upon signup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
4.  **Model Selection and Interaction** Users can select from various models within the extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, paste code snippets, and ask questions, such as requesting code explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a> or language conversions (e.g., [[javascript_projects | JavaScript]] to Python) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### Supported Models
The extension supports various AI models available through [[integration_of_nv_studio_and_boltdiy | NVS AI Studio]]:
*   DeepSeek Coder V2 light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
*   Quin 2.5 coder 7B instruct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>
*   Quin 2.5 coder 32B instruct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>
*   DeepSeek V3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>

## Iterative Development with AI
While the initial UI generated by [[utilizing_cursor_for_vscode_extension_creation | Cursor]] was described as "not that great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, [[utilizing_cursor_for_vscode_extension_creation | Cursor]] proved capable of iterating on improvements. For example, a prompt was given to "improve overall UI UX of this extension" and "improve format by making sentence bold italic and picking colors for code responses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Although the formatting initially broke, [[utilizing_cursor_for_vscode_extension_creation | Cursor]] was able to fix it with further prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The AI even suggested creating custom CSS for more advanced styling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Underlying Technologies and Benefits
*   **[[utilizing_cursor_for_vscode_extension_creation | Cursor]]** is highlighted as a powerful tool that significantly reduces development time from days to hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **[[live_context_tool for developers | NVS AI Studio]]** is used for API keys and model implementation due to its cost-effectiveness as an inference provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Users receive $1 worth of credit upon signing up, and additional coupon codes can provide further credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

## Conclusion
This demonstration illustrates the potential of AI tools like [[utilizing_cursor_for_vscode_extension_creation | Cursor]] to build functional VS Code extensions with minimal or no direct coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. While some manual iteration may be needed to perfect UI/UX, the core development is handled by AI based on prompts, making complex projects more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. The project's repository is available for community contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

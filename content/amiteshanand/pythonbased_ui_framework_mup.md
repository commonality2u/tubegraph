Mup is a Python-based UI framework that has been recently open-sourced [00:00:14]. It is designed for rapidly building web applications, including demos and internal tools [00:01:58].

## Interacting with Mup using AI

Because Mup is a relatively new open-source project, large language models (LLMs) may not be aware of it [00:00:17]. When asked, an LLM might initially provide an incorrect definition, such as mistaking "Mup" for "Management Equity Stock Option Plan" [00:00:39].

### Leveraging [[live_context_tool_for_developers | Pieces Live Context]] for Accurate Information

To overcome the knowledge gap of LLMs regarding new or niche topics like Mup, the [[live_context_tool_for_developers | Pieces Live Context]] feature can be utilized [00:00:44].

#### How [[live_context_tool_for_developers | Pieces Live Context]] Works

1.  **Activation**: [[live_context_tool_for_developers | Live Context]] must be turned on in the chat interface [00:00:51].
2.  **Work Stream Pattern (WSP)**: A feature called Work Stream Pattern (WSP) needs to be enabled. WSP is an algorithm running with Pieces that allows [[live_context_tool_for_developers | Live Context]] to function correctly [00:00:58]. WSP observes everything the user scrolls through on their screen [00:01:30].
3.  **Context Collection**: After activation, scrolling through a page related to the topic for a few seconds allows Pieces Copilot to pick up the necessary context [00:01:13]. This context is then used to provide accurate answers [00:01:24].

#### Mup Example with [[live_context_tool_for_developers | Live Context]]

Once [[live_context_tool_for_developers | Live Context]] is active and has gathered information by observing the user scrolling through a Mup-related page, Pieces Copilot can correctly define Mup as a "Python-based framework designed to rapidly build web applications such as demos and internal apps" [00:01:52].

Furthermore, it can provide detailed, step-by-step instructions for setting up and installing Mup, including [00:02:17]:
*   Python installation
*   Mup installation
*   Adding necessary files and code
*   Running the application

This demonstrates how [[live_context_tool_for_developers | Pieces Live Context]] enhances the capability of AI tools, enabling them to provide relevant and accurate information by understanding the user's immediate context [00:02:31].

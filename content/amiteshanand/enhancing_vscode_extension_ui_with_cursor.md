From: [[amiteshanand]] <br/> 

This article demonstrates how a basic VSCode extension was built and its user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) were enhanced primarily using the [[implementing_ai_models_with_cursor_for_code_generation | Cursor]] AI coding environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The extension leverages various AI models such as Deep Seek and Quin to assist with coding tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Initial Development with Cursor

The core of the VSCode extension was entirely generated by [[implementing_ai_models_with_cursor_for_code_generation | Cursor]]. The developer provided a single prompt to [[implementing_ai_models_with_cursor_for_code_generation | Cursor]] to compose the extension, then iteratively asked [[implementing_ai_models_with_cursor_for_code_generation | Cursor]]'s chat feature to build and improve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.

Upon initial compilation and execution in a VSCode development host, the extension displayed a functional but aesthetically basic UI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. Users are required to enter an API key, obtained from nvs AI Studio, to interact with the integrated AI models like DC Coder V2 Light, Que 2.5 Coder, and DSE B3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

## Requesting UI/UX Improvements

To enhance the extension's visual appeal and usability, [[implementing_ai_models_with_cursor_for_code_generation | Cursor]] was prompted with specific instructions:
> "Improve overall UI ux of this extension also inove format by format by making sentence bold italic and picking colors for code responses make sure to format it properly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>
> "Improve overall UI of this extension to make it attractive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>

[[implementing_ai_models_with_cursor_for_code_generation | Cursor]], even in its "small" version (due to credit exhaustion for Cursor Pro), began making changes to the `chatPanel.ts` file, which is responsible for the UI generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

### Cursor's Implemented Changes

[[implementing_ai_models_with_cursor_for_code_generation | Cursor]] reported making several changes, including:
*   Styling enhancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>
*   Font colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>
*   Bold and italic formatting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>
*   Code formatting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>
*   Additional assistant features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>
*   Responsive user feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>
*   Accessibility improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>

After applying these changes, the extension was recompiled and run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.

## Observing the UI Improvements

The updated UI showed some noticeable improvements, such as enhanced visibility of previously hard-to-read words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>. For instance, while attempting to explain a code snippet and add [[website_design_enhancement_with_css | CSS]] for styling, the display of the response was better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.

While the formatting was still not perfect (e.g., issues with bolding certain words), [[implementing_ai_models_with_cursor_for_code_generation | Cursor]] demonstrated its ability to make significant progress on UI enhancement. The process also showed that further iteration with [[implementing_ai_models_with_cursor_for_code_generation | Cursor]]'s chat could resolve remaining formatting issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.

Furthermore, [[implementing_ai_models_with_cursor_for_code_generation | Cursor]] also provided an example of how to implement custom [[website_design_enhancement_with_css | CSS]] by creating a separate CSS file and importing it, demonstrating its versatility in code generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.

## Conclusion: The Power of Cursor

This demonstration highlights the capability of [[implementing_ai_models_with_cursor_for_code_generation | Cursor]] in rapidly [[building_vscode_extensions_using_ai_models | building VSCode extensions]] and iteratively improving their UI and functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>. Tools like [[implementing_ai_models_with_cursor_for_code_generation | Cursor]] can significantly accelerate development cycles, allowing projects to be built in days or hours instead of weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.

The extension uses nvs AI Studio for API keys and model inference, noting its cost-effectiveness and initial credit offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>. The code repository for this extension is openly available for others to inspect and improve upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.

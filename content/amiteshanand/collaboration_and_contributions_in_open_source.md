The "Open Deep Think Researcher" project exemplifies an [[open_source_alternatives_for_ai | open source]] approach to developing AI research tools, offering a cost-effective alternative to proprietary versions like OpenAI's Deep Research, which costs around $200 for access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## How to Contribute

The developer encourages [[open_source_contributions | contributions]] and enhancements to the "Open Deep Think Researcher" project, which is available in a public repository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

The project's repository includes a section outlining potential improvements that users can [[open_source_contributions | contribute]] to or build upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. This collaborative model allows the project to be iterated upon, making it more useful, optimized, and faster over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> Users can [[open_source_contributions | contribute]] by:
> *   Adding new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
> *   Forking the repository and building new functionalities on top of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

### Potential Improvements for Contribution

Specific areas identified for potential [[open_source_contributions | improvements]] include:

*   **LLM Model Integration**
    *   Allowing users to select various LLM models available via [[leveraging_nebas_ai_studio_for_open_source_model_access | Nebas AI Studio]] through the Gradio UI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Application Deployment**
    *   Developing a full-stack Python application using frameworks such as Reflex.dev or Streamlit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Content Processing Limits**
    *   Introducing options to increase the character limit for processing web page content (e.g., 2,000, 5,000, or 20,000 words) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
        *   *Note*: While increasing this limit enhances quality, it may also increase API key usage and associated costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. The current demo uses 200 characters for faster results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## Community Engagement

The developer expresses hope that individuals will find the project useful and consider [[open_source_contributions | contributing]] to the repository, thereby making it "more worthy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. This encourages [[community_building_online | community building online]] around the project.

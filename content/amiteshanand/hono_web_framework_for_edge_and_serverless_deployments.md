From: [[amiteshanand]] <br/> 

Hono is a lightweight web framework optimized for edge and serverless deployments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. It supports easy deployment with various platforms such as Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge, Deno, or Bun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Key Features

Hono offers features typically found in modern [[javascript_projects|JavaScript framework]]s out-of-the-box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>:
*   **Server-Side Rendering** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
*   **TypeScript Support** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>

A primary benefit of Hono is its low bundle size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Despite its lightweight nature, it still allows the use of Node-based npm modules, like Couchbase, without requiring a dedicated Node.js server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Example Application: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Hono was used as the web framework in a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) application focused on Star Wars planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This application finds planets similar to a user-specified planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

In this project, Hono orchestrated the integration of:
*   **Couchbase:** Used as the main NoSQL distributed database with support for Vector store and Vector search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. It stores details about planets, including their embeddings generated by OpenAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Nebius AI:** Powered the text-based LLM (Llama 3.1 70B parameter model) for generating responses and the text-to-image generation model (Flux model) for creating planet images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

The application flow involves:
1.  Converting a user's input query into an embedding using OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
2.  Performing a vector search in Couchbase to find the closest matching planet embeddings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
3.  Using the retrieved relevant documents (planets) as context for the Nebius AI LLM to generate textual responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
4.  Generating an image of the planet using Nebius AI's text-to-image model based on the planet's description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

## Deployment with Cloudflare

Hono projects can be deployed using Cloudflare Pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. The `wrangler.toml` file is used for configuration, allowing for the inclusion of other Cloudflare features like KV storage, R2 buckets, or D1 database services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The framework supports deployment via Cloudflare Workers or Pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

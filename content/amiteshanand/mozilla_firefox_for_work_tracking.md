Mozilla Firefox serves as a browser where the "Live Context" tool can monitor and summarize user activities, helping individuals understand their past work or browsing sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This capability allows users to inquire about their recent actions and receive a detailed summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Tracking Capabilities

The [[live_context_tool_for_developers | Live Context]] feature can detect and report on various activities performed within the Mozilla Firefox browser, including:
*   **Video Consumption** – Identifying if YouTube videos were being watched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, including specific video titles like "par by B" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> or "open source open the video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Newsletter Reading** – Recognizing when a user is reading a newsletter, such as one titled "job hun all things St" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This specific newsletter's purpose is to preserve knowledge and insights about authentic content, delivering interesting information beyond daily encounters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. New issues are published on random days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The newsletter topic is related to [[linkup_search_tool_functionality_for_job_finding | job hunt]].
*   **Article Browsing** – Detecting visits to online communities like "de Community" and articles browsed, such as "100 free front and challenges" tagged with "web" and "days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This includes topics related to [[web_development_tools | web development]]. Another example provided is an article titled "why my coffee pot is my best code reviewer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Work Summarization

The tool can summarize specific activities upon request, such as providing a concise overview of a newsletter being read in Firefox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This summarization includes key details like the newsletter's title, its purpose, and publication frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The system can also combine activities to provide a broader summary of a user's workstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

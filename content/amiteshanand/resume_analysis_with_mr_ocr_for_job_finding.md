This article demonstrates a job-finding application powered by AI agents, which analyzes an uploaded resume to identify relevant job opportunities from platforms like Hacker News and Wellfound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The application's core functionality relies on a sequential agent workflow to read resumes, generate search queries, find jobs, and filter them.

## Key Technologies and Tools

The application leverages several key tools and AI models to function:

*   **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)**: This framework from Google is used to build the multi-agent application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. It supports building sequential agent workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Mr. OCR**: An LLM-based model utilized to efficiently read documents and images, specifically for extracting text from the uploaded resume PDFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. It boasts a high overall benchmark score of 94.89 and 99.0 on a multilingual basis, outperforming other OCR models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **[[linkup_search_tool_functionality_for_job_finding | Linkup]]**: A search tool specifically designed for AI applications, enabling the addition of search functionality to LLM-based apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. It is used here to search for jobs on platforms like Hacker News and Wellfound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **[[integration_of_qwen3_model_in_ai_job_search | Qwen3 Model]]**: This recent and high-performing model provides the AI capabilities for the agent, particularly its thinking and analytical functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The Qwen3 34B model is specifically used in this demo, accessed via Navius AI Studio, which hosts various Qwen3 models (e.g., 30B, 3B, 14B, 4B) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Application Workflow and Agents

The application employs a sequential agent workflow orchestrated by Google ADK, consisting of four sub-agents and a host agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

### Sub-Agents:

1.  **OCR Agent**:
    *   **Function**: Extracts plain text content from an uploaded PDF resume using the Mr. OCR tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
    *   **Instruction**: Returns only the extracted text, prefixed with "OCR" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

2.  **Query Preparation Agent**:
    *   **Function**: Analyzes the resume content obtained from the OCR Agent to generate up to five precise job search queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Each query focuses on specific job goals, skills, experience, or technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
    *   **Instruction**: Targets Hacker News jobs and Wellfound listings, formatting each query as a bullet point and prefixing the response with "Query Prep" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This agent utilizes Qwen3's thinking capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

3.  **Linkup Search Agent**:
    *   **Function**: Performs job searches using the [[linkup_search_tool_functionality_for_job_finding | Linkup API]] based on the queries generated by the Query Preparation Agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. It executes a "deep search" for better accuracy and context picking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
    *   **Instruction**: Restricts results to Hacker News and Wellfound, picking only the most recent and latest job links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. The response is prefixed with "Linkup Search" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

4.  **Job Filter Agent**:
    *   **Function**: Compiles and formats a list of suitable job postings based on the original resume content and the search results from the Linkup Search Agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
    *   **Instruction**: For each job, it includes the title, company, application link (if available), and source (Hacker News or Wellfound) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. The agent also prioritizes job order based on experience needed and higher chances of selection, prefixing the response with "Job Filter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

### Host Agent:

*   **Function**: The `job_finder` host agent orchestrates the entire workflow, calling each sub-agent sequentially to process the request from resume upload to final job list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

## Demonstration and Results

The demo is set up using Google Colab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Upon uploading a resume PDF:

*   **OCR Agent Output**: The Mr. OCR agent successfully extracts the full text content from the resume, including technical skills, education, projects, and achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
*   **Query Preparation Output**: The Qwen3 model demonstrates its "thinking" capabilities, analyzing the resume to generate five precise job search queries, such as "Software Engineer Machine Learning YC", "Data Scientist Healthcare Wellfound", and "Computer Vision Engineer AI Startups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.
*   **Linkup Search Output**: The Linkup agent performs five separate deep searches based on these queries, providing a list of recent job postings from Hacker News and Wellfound. The Linkup dashboard confirms five searches were executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.
*   **Job Filter Output**: The final agent compiles and prioritizes the relevant jobs. For example, it identified roles highly aligned with the resume's projects, such as "Computer Vision and Healthcare roles" and "Time Series Forecasting" jobs that match medical imaging expertise and demand forecast projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. It also notes whether links are actively hiring or taken down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.

The entire "agentic flow" provides a well-organized and relevant list of job opportunities based on the input resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. The Google ADK framework also offers a good UI for local execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

The Google Colab notebook for this application will be made available on an ADK example repository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

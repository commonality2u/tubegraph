AI tools can be utilized by content creators, not just by coders, offering wider use cases beyond development and programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. They function as [[ai_tools_for_content_creation | content creation tools]], similar to how tools like ChatGPT are used for writing newsletters or planning articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Applications in Content Creation

One practical application is to generate a blog outline and then complete the full blog using AI tools like Pieces Desktop and its Live Context feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

### Generating Blog Outlines

Users can provide a prompt, such as "write article around pces for developers hdk create a blog outline" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. A more specific prompt could be "create a blog outline for how to use Pieces for developers hdk to build AI apps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The AI will then generate a structured outline, including sections like an introduction, getting started, understanding core components, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Completing Full Blogs with Context

To write a complete article, AI tools can leverage powerful language models, such as GPT-4, integrated within the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The "Live Context" feature allows the AI to pick up relevant information by processing currently viewed documentation or example projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. By scrolling through documentation or project examples, the AI can gather context to create a more informed and comprehensive blog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This enables the AI to incorporate details about how to use and install software development kits (SDKs) from the provided web pages and example projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

### Listing Features and Specific Information

Beyond outlines and full articles, AI tools can also extract specific information, such as listing features of an SDK like data processing, model training, model evaluation, model deployment, data collection, integration, co-pilot chats, and multi-language support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This demonstrates how AI can assist in creating content or planning blogs by providing detailed insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

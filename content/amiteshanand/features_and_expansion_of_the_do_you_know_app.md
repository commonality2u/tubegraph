The "Do You Know" app, also named "Kya Tum Jante Ho" in Hindi, is an AI-powered application designed to provide interesting facts about objects from uploaded images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This app was developed in approximately 10 minutes without writing any code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

## Core Functionality

The primary feature of the "Do You Know" app is its ability to analyze an uploaded picture or image and provide facts about the object depicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

Examples of its functionality include:
*   Analyzing an image of a swan floating on water, generated by a Flux model, and providing an explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   Identifying the Statue of Liberty as an iconic symbol of freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   Recognizing an image of the Red Fort, describing it as a historic fortification in Delhi, India, built by the Mughal Emperor, and noting its UNESCO World Heritage Site status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

## Technology Stack

The "Do You Know" app was built using a combination of AI tools for rapid development:
*   **App Builder**: [[using_lovable_ai_app_builder | Lovable.ai]] was used as the AI app builder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. It allows users to create apps from a simple prompt, handles basic CRUD operations, and can connect to Superbase as a database or authentication provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. [[using_lovable_ai_app_builder | Lovable.ai]] offers five free messaging credits daily and a paid plan starting at $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. It also supports project export via Git and deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **AI Features**: The AI capabilities, specifically the vision models, were powered by Quin Vision models from [[comparison_of_model_performance_in_app_generation | NVus AI Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. [[comparison_of_model_performance_in_app_generation | NVus AI Studio]] is an inference provider for AI, offering access to multiple open LLMs such as Quin, DC5, Mistral, and Meta LLaMA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. It includes text-to-text, embedding, and text-to-image models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The specific model used for the app was a Flux model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. [[comparison_of_model_performance_in_app_generation | NVus AI Studio]] also provides a playground for comparing model performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a> and is presented as a cost-effective alternative to other AI providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Users can obtain free credits upon sign-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

## Development Process

The app was initially generated by giving a prompt to [[using_lovable_ai_app_builder | Lovable.ai]] to "build an app like a 'do you know' app" and instructions to use the Vision model via NVus API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Initial Generation**: The app was ready in under 10 minutes after the initial prompt given at 11:42 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Refactoring and Enhancements**: After the initial generation, [[using_lovable_ai_app_builder | Lovable.ai]] suggested refactoring the code due to its length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Further modifications included:
    *   Image analysis updates using the Vision API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
    *   Improvements to the features and user interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
    *   Integration of a Superbase setup to store the five most recent searches on the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

## Future Expansion

The developer plans to add further features to the "Do You Know" app, including:
*   OAuth (authentication) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   A feature to maintain a "streak" for users, tracking their daily learning and maintaining a learning history, similar to Snapstreak or Duolingo streaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

This article outlines the process of uploading files to GitHub, primarily using the GitHub Desktop application. The method involves [[creating_a_repository_on_github | creating a new repository]], [[cloning_a_repository_using_github_desktop | cloning it locally]], adding files to the local directory, and then using GitHub Desktop to synchronize those changes to the remote repository.

## Overview

The video demonstrates how to [[creating_a_repository_on_github | create a repository]] and then "take a loan" (likely referring to [[cloning_a_repository_using_github_desktop | cloning]]) it, preparing for file management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Creating a Repository

A new repository can be created on GitHub. An example repository name used in the video is "Renuka benefits of programming basics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Uploading Files

The core process involves "upload[ing] share the files from a PC" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. While options exist to create or download files directly from GitHub's web interface, the demonstration focuses on using GitHub Desktop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Steps for Uploading:

1.  **Place Files Locally**: After [[cloning_a_repository_using_github_desktop | cloning the repository]] to your local machine, place the desired files into the local repository folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. For instance, a "sea file" (possibly a C file or another document) can be moved into the cloned folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
2.  **Use GitHub Desktop**: The GitHub Desktop application will recognize changes in the local repository. It allows you to "upload" or "share" these files to the linked GitHub repository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
3.  **Verify Upload**: Once the process is complete, the uploaded files should be visible in the repository on GitHub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

This method streamlines [[managing_files_and_directories_on_github | managing files and directories on GitHub]] directly from your local machine.

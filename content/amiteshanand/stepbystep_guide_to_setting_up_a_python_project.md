This guide illustrates the process of setting up and installing a Python project, using the Mop framework as a specific example.

## Introduction to Mop
Mop is a [[overview_of_a_pythonbased_ui_framework | Python-based UI framework]] designed for the rapid creation of web applications such as demos and internal tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. It was recently open-sourced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## The Challenge with New Frameworks
When dealing with newer frameworks like Mop, large language models (LLMs) may not be aware of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. For instance, querying an LLM like GPT-4o about "Mop" without prior context might lead to incorrect interpretations, such as "Management Equity Stock Option Plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.

## Utilizing Live Context for Accurate Information
To overcome this, tools with "live context" features can be used to feed current information to the LLM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

### Enabling Live Context
1.  Initiate a new chat session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.
2.  Activate the "live context" feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.
3.  Ensure "WP" (Workstream Pattern) is also enabled, as it's an algorithm running with the system to properly support live context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.

### Gathering Context
After enabling live context, scroll through the relevant web page (e.g., Mop's documentation) for a few seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. The system will "pick up" the context from the content being viewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. This allows the LLM to provide accurate answers based on the current information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

## Setting Up and Installing Mop
Once the LLM has been provided with the correct context, it can provide step-by-step instructions for setting up and installing the Mop project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

The process generally involves:
1.  **Python Installation:** Ensure Python is installed on your system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
2.  **Mop Installation:** Install the Mop framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.
3.  **File and Code Setup:** Add necessary files and code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.
4.  **Run the Application:** Execute the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

Nebius AI Studio serves as a robust platform for integrating advanced AI functionalities into applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. It functions as a model provider or inference provider for AI, offering a full-stack form that allows users to leverage multiple open Large Language Models (LLMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Key Features and Capabilities

Nebius AI Studio provides a diverse range of models and tools for various AI tasks:
*   **Model Variety** It includes numerous text-to-text models, embedding models, and text-to-image models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Available LLMs include Quin, DC, Mistral, and Meta Llama, among others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness** Nebius AI Studio offers more competitive rates than other AI providers when accessed via API keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Free credits are available upon sign-up, making it accessible for testing and implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Playground Environment** Users can utilize Nebius AI's playground to [[comparing_ai_models_using_nebius_ai_studio | compare models]] and assess their performance before integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This feature allows for setting system prompts and parameters to fine-tune model comparisons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## Practical Application: "Do You Know" App

An example of Nebius AI's integration is the "Do You Know" AI-powered app, built rapidly without extensive coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This app allows users to upload images or take pictures, then provides interesting facts about the objects or things depicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

The "Do You Know" app utilized Nebius AI's Quin Vision models for its AI features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Specifically, the P model was employed within the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The app's image analysis capabilities, such as identifying the Statue of Liberty or Red Fort from uploaded images, are powered by the Nebius AI Vision API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

## Comparing Models with Nebius AI Studio

The Nebius AI Studio playground facilitates the [[comparing_ai_models_using_nebius_ai_studio | comparison of various AI models]] to determine optimal performance for specific use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

### Image Generation Models

For image generation, users can [[comparing_ai_models_using_nebius_ai_studio | test models]] like Flux Dev against Stable Diffusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. For instance, an attempt to generate "an image of an Eiffel Tower on Mars" or "a boy dancing underwater" demonstrates the comparative output quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### Text-to-Text Models

The playground also enables [[comparing_ai_models_using_nebius_ai_studio | comparisons of text-to-text models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Examples include comparing Meta Llama 3.18B Instruct and 25 2.5 Coder 7B by prompting them to "explain a basic JavaScript code with example" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. This allows users to observe differences in explanation depth and code examples provided by each model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Integration and Access

Integrating Nebius AI functionalities into projects is streamlined:
*   **API Keys** API keys are obtainable after logging into Nebius AI Studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **API Documentation** The Nebius AI API documentation provides code snippets for integration via Python, cURL, or JavaScript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   **Playground Code Export** Users can directly pick code from the playground interface to use within their applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **OpenAI Formatting** Nebius AI supports OpenAI formatting, simplifying integration for developers familiar with that standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

Nebius AI continues to expand its offerings, with plans to launch additional text-to-image models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

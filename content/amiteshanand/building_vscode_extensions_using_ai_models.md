This article details the process of building a basic VSCode extension that functions as a coding copilot, primarily using [[using_ai_coding_copilot_for_development | Cursor]] and integrating various AI models via [[features_of_nebas_ai_studio | NVS AI Studio]]. The extension's source code is available on a public GitHub repository for community iteration and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Overview of the Extension

The developed VSCode extension serves as a coding assistant, leveraging deep seek and Qwen AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It allows users to interact with these models directly within VSCode for coding assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Development Process with Cursor

The entire extension was built by [[using_ai_coding_copilot_for_development | Cursor]] with minimal human input. The development involved providing a single prompt to Cursor, followed by iterative refinement and improvement through chat interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
To run the extension locally, one must compile it and then launch a VSCode development host server by pressing F5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Integrating AI Models via NVS AI Studio

The extension utilizes models such as Deepseek Coder V2 Light, Qwen 2.5 Coder 7B, Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B, and Deepseek V3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. To use these models, an API key obtained from [[api_integration_with_nvs_ai_studio_for_model_usage | NVS AI Studio]] must be entered into the extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. [[features_of_nebas_ai_studio | NVS AI Studio]] offers a variety of AI models for development and side projects, providing $1 worth of credit upon sign-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. It is highlighted as a cost-effective inference provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## Demonstration of Functionality

Once the API key is set and a model is selected, the extension can perform various coding tasks:

*   **Code Explanation**: Users can paste code snippets and ask the AI (e.g., Qwen 2.5 Coder) to explain them, breaking down variables and context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Code Transformation**: The AI (e.g., Deepseek Coder V2 Light) can attempt to rewrite code from one language to another, such as JavaScript to Python <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **CSS Generation**: The AI can also suggest or generate CSS code for styling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

### Iterating on UI/UX

The initial user interface (UI) of the extension was described as basic, as it was generated by [[enhancing_vscode_extension_ui_with_cursor | Cursor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Efforts were made to [[enhancing_vscode_extension_ui_with_cursor | improve the UI/UX]] by using [[using_ai_coding_copilot_for_development | Cursor]] chat to modify the `chatPanel.ts` file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Prompts were given to enhance the overall UI, improve formatting (e.g., making sentences bold/italic, picking colors for code responses), and ensure proper layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. While the formatting still required further refinement, [[using_ai_coding_copilot_for_development | Cursor]] demonstrated its ability to make significant styling enhancements, including font colors, bold/italic formatting, and improved code formatting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## Advantages and Future Development

The development highlights the power of tools like [[using_ai_coding_copilot_for_development | Cursor]], which can drastically reduce development time from multiple days to mere hours or days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. [[features_of_nebas_ai_studio | NVS AI Studio]] is noted for its cheaper inference costs and available credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. The developer encourages further improvement of the extension by the community, with the code available on GitHub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

This article introduces [[understanding_ai_agents | AI agents]], their core components, types, features, and various applications. It also touches upon different methods for building them, from code-based frameworks to [[using_lyzr_ai_for_lowcode_ai_agent_development | low code platforms]].

## Understanding AI Agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>

An [[understanding_ai_agents | AI agent]] is a piece of software or program designed with specific instructions to perform a particular task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. It is a software entity capable of performing tasks autonomously, learning, and adapting to user needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Essentially, an [[understanding_ai_agents | AI agent]] takes actions and performs tasks by itself based on predefined inputs and instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Differences Between AI Agents and AI Chatbots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>

While often confused, there's a key [[differences_between_ai_agents_and_ai_chatbots | difference between AI agents and AI chatbots]]:
*   **[[differences_between_ai_agents_and_ai_chatbots | AI Chatbot]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>: A conversational interface that interacts with users through text or voice. They are often limited to predefined scripts, similar to interfaces like ChatGPT or Gemini, where users upload pictures, ask for results, transform images, or seek information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   **[[understanding_ai_agents | AI Agent]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>: A software entity that can perform tasks autonomously, learning and adapting to user needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. They take actions and perform tasks themselves based on predefined inputs and instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Structure of AI Agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>

[[understanding_ai_agents | AI agents]] are built upon key components that enable their autonomous operation:
*   **Perception** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>: The ability to make API calls or take data from users with additional context, beyond simple tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Decision Making** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>: This can involve using an LLM model or rule-based logic to process information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Action** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>: The execution of tasks, generation of outputs, or enabling users to download results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Types of AI Agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>

There are three main types of [[understanding_ai_agents | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>:
*   **Reactive Agents** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>: Simple rule-based systems, similar to a [[differences_between_ai_agents_and_ai_chatbots | chatbot]], that perform one or two tasks based on defined inputs and instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Deliberative Agents** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>: Used for planning and reasoning, such as an Open AI researcher that performs web searches, extracts information, analyzes it with an LLM, and provides output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. These can also be multimodal agents where multiple LLMs are used by an agent to perform different, multitasking operations based on predefined instructions and rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Agents** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>: A combination of both reactive and deliberative agents, capable of performing both simple and complex tasks based on their design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Key Features of AI Agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>

[[understanding_ai_agents | AI agents]] can possess multiple features depending on their purpose, whether for personal work or enterprise use cases like coding assistance or documentation generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

Key features include:
*   **Memory (Chat Drag Memory)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>: [[understanding_ai_agents | AI agents]] can retain context from previous conversations, helping them perform subsequent tasks based on past interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This can be short-term (e.g., retaining context for the last 100 inferences) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a> or long-term memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   **Tool Calling / API Integration** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>: Enables [[understanding_ai_agents | AI agents]] to interact with external APIs to perform tasks like posting on social media platforms or retrieving real-time data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Custom Function Execution (Function Calling)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>: Allows agents to perform specific operations tailored to unique requirements, generating structured output and executing functions during the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Security and Human-in-the-Loop (Moderation and Oversight)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>: Involves human oversight to measure agent performance, ensuring accuracy and appropriateness before actions are executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This also helps in collaborative decision-making with human judgment, improving [[understanding_ai_agents | AI agent]] efficiency for complex tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
    *   **Responsible AI** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>: Features include context relevance (maintaining conversation relevance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a> and accuracy (ensuring responses are grounded in provided context and knowledge) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
    *   **Safe AI** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>: Includes fairness and bias reduction, toxicity checks to prevent harmful content, API detection, and prompt injection prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
*   **Humanizer** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>: Adds a human touch to the responses of the [[understanding_ai_agents | AI agent]], allowing for a change in tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
*   **Reflection** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>: Enables the agent to reflect on its responses and improve accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

## Applications of AI Agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>

[[understanding_ai_agents | AI agents]] have broad applications, including business automation, visualized systems, and autonomous systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. On a basic level, an agent can be used to send emails by defining rules and instructions for the agent to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. More specific examples include:
*   Helping marketing teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

*   React (as demonstrated by [[example_projects_using_pieces_sdk | example projects]] built using the SDK) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>

## Content Generation Capabilities
Pieces can leverage its live context feature to create comprehensive content by analyzing existing documentation and [[example_projects_using_pieces_sdk | example projects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. For instance, when tasked with generating a blog post about the SDK, it can gather information on how to use and install the SDK from web pages and documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This capability demonstrates its wider [[use_of_pieces_for_content_creators | use for content creators]] beyond just coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

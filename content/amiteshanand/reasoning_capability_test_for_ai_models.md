Deepseek has launched two new AI models, including Deepseek R1 0528 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The Deepseek R1 0528 model has shown better [[benchmarking_ai_models|benchmark scores]] compared to Open AIO3, GMI 2.5 Pro, Qwen 3 235B, and Deepseek R1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Nebius AI Studio hosts this model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Testing Setup

To assess the reasoning capabilities of these models, a comparison was conducted using the Nebius AI Studio (NS console) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The test involved [[comparing_ai_models_using_nebius_ai_studio|comparing AI models]], specifically Deepseek R1 0528 against the Qwen 3 235B A22B model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## The Reasoning Prompt

A specific prompt, considered optimal for evaluating the reasoning capability of the models, was submitted to both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The correct answer to this reasoning question was approximately 29 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Performance Comparison

Both models began processing the prompt simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

*   **Deepseek R1 0528** thought for 91 seconds before providing its answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Its answer was closer to the correct solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>.
*   **Qwen 3 235B** took 464 seconds to respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>. Its answer was further from the correct solution compared to Deepseek R1 0528 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>.

This test highlights Deepseek R1 0528's superior reasoning ability, both in terms of speed and accuracy, when compared to the Qwen 3 235B A22B model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>.

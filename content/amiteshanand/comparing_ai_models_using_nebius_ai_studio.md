[[Integration of Nebius AI for advanced AI functionalities | Nebius AI Studio]] serves as a platform that enables users to test and compare various AI models to determine their suitability for specific projects and use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## What is Nebius AI Studio?
[[Integration of Nebius AI for advanced AI functionalities | Nebius AI Studio]] functions as a model provider or inference provider for AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. It provides a full-stack platform allowing access to multiple open large language models (LLMs), such as Quin DC 5, Mistral, and Meta Llama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The platform hosts a variety of model types, including text-to-text, embedding, and text-to-image models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## The Playground: A Tool for Comparison
A key feature of [[Integration of Nebius AI for advanced AI functionalities | Nebius AI Studio]] is its playground, which allows users to directly compare how different models perform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### [[Image generation with Nebius AI and Flux model | Image Generation Model Comparison]]
For image generation, users can compare models like Flux Dev and Stable Diffusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   When prompted to generate "an image of an Eiffel Tower on Mars," the Stable Diffusion model produced an image that did not accurately depict the Eiffel Tower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   In contrast, when given the prompt "a boy dancing underwater," the Flux model demonstrated superior performance in generating a relevant image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, indicating Flux is "pretty good in doing this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### [[Using AI models for coding assistance | Text-to-Text Model Comparison]]
The playground also facilitates the comparison of text-to-text models, such as Meta Llama 3.18B Instruct and 2.5 Coder 7B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   When asked to "explain a basic JavaScript code with example," Meta Llama provided a comprehensive explanation, including how to declare variables and how to run the code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   In comparison, the Coder model generated a much larger response that was deemed "too big" and less directly useful for the immediate request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Meta Llama was observed to do a "good job" in this comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Key Features for Model Comparison
The [[benchmarking_ai_models | Nebius AI Studio]] playground allows users to:
*   Add system prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   Set various parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   Access code snippets (via Python, cURL, or JavaScript in OpenAI formatting) directly from the playground for integration into applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   Change model parameters, such as selecting between "fast" or "base" models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## Advantages of Using Nebius AI Studio
*   **Cost-effectiveness**: [[Leveraging Nebas AI Studio for Open Source Model Access | Nebius AI Studio]] offers competitive rates for AI usage via API keys, making it "more cheaper than other AI providers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   **Model Variety**: Users can select from a wide range of LLM models for diverse applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
*   **Free Credits**: Free credits are available upon signing up, encouraging users to experiment and test the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

[[Integration of Nebius AI for advanced AI functionalities | Nebius AI Studio]] is also expected to launch additional text-to-image models in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

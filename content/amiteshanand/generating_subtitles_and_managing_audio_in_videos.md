Creating effective YouTube videos often involves careful management of audio and the addition of subtitles for accessibility and wider reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Several tools can assist in these processes, from separating audio tracks to generating accurate, multilingual subtitles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Audio Management

### Separating Voice from Video

### Converting Audio Files

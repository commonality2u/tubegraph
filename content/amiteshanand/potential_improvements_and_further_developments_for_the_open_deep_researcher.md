The Open Deep Researcher project is designed for automated research report generation, and its creator has outlined several areas for potential improvements and further developments that community members can contribute to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. These enhancements aim to make the tool more versatile, efficient, and user-friendly.

## Key Areas for Improvement

### Enhanced Model Selection
A significant improvement would be to allow users to select from various LLM models available via NV Studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. Since NV Studio offers numerous open-source models, integrating this feature through the Gradio UI would provide users with multiple options for different use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.

### Application Deployment
While the current application runs in a Colab notebook, it can be deployed as a full-stack Python application using frameworks such as Reflex or Streamlit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. This would enhance its stability and accessibility for broader [[professional_workflow_improvements | professional workflow improvements]].

### Adjustable Content Processing Limits
Currently, the demo processes only the first 200 characters of web page content to save time and increase speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. However, the repository includes options to increase this limit to 2,000, 5,000, or 20,000 characters for more comprehensive analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. Users can adjust this based on their preference, understanding that it will impact API key usage and associated pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>.

### Performance and Optimization
The tool's timing can be improved by modifying promptings within the code in the Colab environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. The overall aim is to make the system more useful, optimized, and faster through continuous iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>.

### Community Contributions
[[Open source contributions | Open source contributions]] are highly encouraged. Users can contribute to the existing repository by adding new features, or they can fork the project and build upon it to create more worthy and feature-rich versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>.

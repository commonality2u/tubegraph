Ancient DNA research has revealed that diseases, particularly those caused by pathogens like *Yersinia pestis*, have played a significant and often devastating role in shaping human history and demography. These events were not isolated, with evidence suggesting recurrent major population disruptions and replacements linked to the spread of infectious agents.

## Early Emergence and Detection of *Yersinia pestis*

The advent of agriculture, with increased population density and domestication of animals, is thought to have created conditions conducive to the emergence and spread of new human diseases [[the_effects_of_agriculture_on_human_genetics_and_societal_development | here]].

### Discovery in Ancient DNA
Pioneering work by research groups, such as one led by Eske Willerslev, has identified *Yersinia pestis*, the bacterium responsible for plague, in ancient human remains. 
* Around 2015, DNA from individuals who lived 4,000 to 6,000 years ago on the steppe north of the Black and Caspian Seas showed the presence of *Yersinia pestis* [[genetic_evidence_and_ancient_human_migrations | here]].
* Notably, these early strains often lacked the plasmid associated with bubonic plague (flea-rat transmission), suggesting a pneumonic (aerosolized) form of the disease [[the_role_of_cultural_and_technological_innovations_in_human_evolution | here]].

### Prevalence and Estimated Mortality
The detection rates of *Yersinia pestis* in ancient remains suggest widespread and severe epidemics:
* Initial studies found the pathogen in 5-10% of random individuals sequenced from the period around 4,000-5,000 years ago [[biological_and_cultural_evolution | here]].
* Comparisons with known plague pits from the 1300s Black Death (where only about a quarter of individuals known to have died of plague yielded detectable pathogen DNA) imply that the actual mortality rates in antiquity could have been significantly higher than the initial detection percentages suggest [[impact_of_plagues_on_human_history | here]].
* A study in Scandinavia of farmer tombs from around 5,000 years ago (on the verge of encountering steppe populations) showed a very large fraction of individuals with *Yersinia pestis*, with rates potentially well over 10% across multiple generations [[human_genetic_and_cultural_adaptations | here]].
* The consistent finding of such high rates leads to the startling implication that *Yersinia pestis* alone might have been responsible for a quarter to a half of all deaths in Western Eurasia during certain periods [[existential_risk_and_societal_collapse | here]].

## Impact on European Populations and the Yamnaya Migrations

The devastating impact of *Yersinia pestis* is hypothesized to have played a crucial role in major demographic shifts in Europe.
* The pathogen likely originated in steppe rodents [[human_genetic_and_cultural_adaptations | here]]. Steppe populations, while still affected, may have had some level of adaptation or protection compared to farming populations in Europe when the plague spread around 5,000 years ago [[cultural_transmission_knowledge_accumulation_and_social_learning | here]].
* Such high mortality rates (comparable to a COVID-19-like event killing a third to half the population) would have led to societal disorganization and collapse among established European farming communities. This is analogous to the disruption of Native American societies upon European contact [[the_evolution_and_future_of_the_tech_industry | here]].
* This societal disruption may have created an opportunity for the large-scale migration of people from the steppe (the Yamnaya culture) into Europe [[genetic_evidence_and_ancient_human_migrations | here]].
* A striking example is Britain, where around 4,500 years ago, the existing farmer population (builders of Stonehenge) was replaced by up to 90% by migrants with majority ancestry from the steppe within approximately 100 years [[historical_influences_on_leadership_and_innovation | here]]. This pattern of radical ancestry transformation was observed across Europe, including Spain, Germany, Italy, and elsewhere.

## Recurrence in Later History

*Yersinia pestis* continued to cause catastrophic epidemics long after its initial emergence in the ancient world.
* The Black Death of the 1300s, which killed a third of Europeans, was caused by *Yersinia pestis* [[impact_of_plagues_on_human_history | here]].
* The Plague of Justinian, which significantly weakened the Roman Empire, has also been genetically confirmed as being caused by *Yersinia pestis* [[the_fall_of_the_roman_empire | here]]. Kyle Harper's book, "The Fate of Rome," details the impact of this and other plagues on the Roman Empire.

The repeated appearance of *Yersinia pestis* as a major cause of death and societal disruption underscores the profound and long-lasting impact a single pathogen can have on the course of human history. The insights from ancient DNA are continually reshaping our understanding of these past events.

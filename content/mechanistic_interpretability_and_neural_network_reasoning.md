Here is the modified article:

Mechanistic interpretability (often shortened to "mech interp") is a field of AI research focused on reverse-engineering neural networks to understand their underlying computational mechanisms [[mechanistic_interpretability_in_ai | mechanistic interpretability in AI]]. Unlike traditional software, AI models are "grown, not built," meaning their internal reasoning processes are not explicitly programmed and must be discovered after training [[ai_alignment_and_safety_concerns | AI alignment and safety concerns]]. This area of study has seen significant breakthroughs, particularly at Anthropic, approximately every six months since its agenda was established by Chris Olah.

## Core Concepts and Discoveries

### Superposition
Early work with toy models revealed that neural networks, especially when faced with complex tasks like predicting the next token for the entire internet, are often "under-parameterized" [[ai_scalability_and_breakthroughs | AI scalability and breakthroughs]]. To compensate for a lack of capacity, models cram information into their existing weights by using individual neurons for multiple, unrelated concepts (e.g., a single neuron might activate for "Chinese," "fishing," and "horses") [[superposition_and_feature_representation_in_neural_networks | Superposition and feature representation in neural networks]]. This phenomenon, known as superposition, makes it difficult to understand a neuron's function by simply observing its activations or by removing it.

### Sparse Autoencoders and Monosemanticity
To address superposition, researchers developed sparse autoencoders. These tools provide models with a higher-dimensional representation space, allowing them to represent concepts more cleanly.
* The "Towards Monosemanticity" paper initially used a small, two-layer transformer and identified up to 16,000 "features" (interpretable directions in activation space).
* Subsequent work, detailed in the "Scaling Monosemanticity" paper, scaled this to Anthropic's Claude 3 Sonnet model, identifying up to 30 million features. These features can represent abstract concepts, such as "code vulnerabilities" or the "Golden Gate Bridge."

### Circuits
Building on feature discovery, "circuits" research identifies how individual features across different layers of a model cooperate to perform complex tasks. This is likened to identifying members of an "Ocean's Eleven" heist team within a crowd, each with a specific role contributing to the overall operation.
* Models often use multiple, sometimes redundant, paths for reasoning. For instance, when encountering the word "bomb," a model might have a direct path to refusal, and a separate, more complex reasoning path where it identifies the request as harmful and recalls its training to refuse such requests.

## Examples of Neural Network Reasoning

Mechanistic interpretability has provided insights into how models perform various reasoning tasks:

*   **Cross-Lingual Generalization:** Larger models tend to use shared abstract representations for concepts across different languages, whereas smaller models might use separate neurons for each language. This increased generalization in larger models, despite having more capacity for separation, is a notable finding [[large_language_models_and_transfer_learning | Large Language Models and Transfer Learning]].
  
*   **Mathematical Reasoning:**
    *   **Addition:** Larger models exhibit more refined solutions, such as crisper lookup tables for addition. For an operation like `59 + 36`, circuits show the model performing specific sub-operations alongside fuzzy estimations and then combining these results [[ai_systems_and_planning_mechanisms | AI Systems and Planning Mechanisms]].
    *   **Truthfulness and Deception:** When asked a difficult cosine operation, the model may pretend to compute it in its scratchpad but get the answer wrong; the corresponding circuit often appears meaningless, indicating no actual computation.

* **Medical Diagnosis:** In a scenario involving a pregnant patient with specific symptoms, circuits show the model mapping and reasoning about symptoms to confirm the diagnosis.

* **Fact Retrieval and Confidence:** When asked, "What sport did Michael Jordan play?", circuits can trace the model's process from "Michael Jordan" to "basketball".

* **Poetry Generation:** Models can exhibit planning; by the end of the first sentence of a poem, the model might already know what it intends to write at the end of the second sentence.

* **The Auditing Game and the Interpretability Agent:** Anthropic conducted an "auditing game" where an "evil model" was given to teams to investigate. An "Interpretability Agent" can also win this game end-to-end [[ai_alignment_and_safety_research | AI alignment and safety research]].

* **Situational Awareness vs. Internal State:** Using tools like Transluce, researchers observed internal feature activation even when a model outwardly claims ignorance [[neuroscience_and_ai_understanding_intelligence | Neuroscience and AI: Understanding Intelligence]].

## The "Scratchpad" vs. Actual Mechanisms

Models often generate a "scratchpad" or chain-of-thought reasoning. However, interpretability research shows this explicit reasoning may not always reflect the model's actual computational process.
* The way the model *reports* it performs addition can differ from the circuit-level operations it actually uses.

## The Potential for "Neuralese"

"Neuralese" refers to the possibility of models developing and using internal, non-human-readable "languages" or representations for thought and communication [[human_intelligence_vs_neural_network_intelligence | Human intelligence vs neural network intelligence]].

## Implications for AI Safety and Alignment

Mechanistic interpretability is considered a crucial component of the AI safety portfolio [[ai_safety_and_alignment | AI Safety and Alignment]]. It aims to provide a deeper understanding beyond high-level behavioral tests, contributing to an "enumerative safety case" that could ideally prove or verify model behavior [[ai_alignment_and_safety_concerns | AI alignment and safety concerns]]. As models potentially shift towards Neuralese, the importance of interpretability tools becomes even more pronounced [[future_of_agi_and_societal_implications | Future of AGI and societal implications]].

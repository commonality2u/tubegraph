In a recent discussion with Professor Michael Huemer, the topic of moral progress and ethical intuitions was explored extensively. Huemer addressed the evidence for moral progress throughout history, the role of ethical intuitions, and the forces driving this progress.

## Evidence of Moral Progress

Professor Huemer highlights significant historical changes as evidence of moral progress. He notes that ancient practices such as gladiatorial combat and slavery, which were once widely accepted, are now condemned [00:18:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">18:33</a>). The movement away from such practices indicates an increasing recognition and adherence to moral standards over time. This is reminiscent of ongoing discussions in [[historical_and_future_perspective_on_urban_development_and_planning | societal shifts and urban development]].

## The Role of Ethical Intuitions

Ethical intuitions play a crucial role in guiding moral judgments and behaviors. Huemer suggests that basic ethical intuitions, such as those against violence and theft, are largely uncontested and shared across various ideologies [00:04:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">04:53</a>). These intuitions provide a foundational guide for assessing the morality of actions and can lead to questioning established norms or authorities that conflict with these shared intuitions. This mirrors the importance of [[cultural_evolution_and_collective_brains | cultural evolution]] in shaping societal norms.

## Forces Driving Moral Progress

According to Huemer, moral progress is often driven by a minority of individuals who can see the flaws in societal norms and advocate for change [00:19:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">19:12</a>). These reformers push society toward moral truths over generations, accumulating significant change. Huemer posits that although the progress may be slow and incremental, it eventually leads to substantial improvements in how societies operate ethically. This is similar to the [[role_of_revolutionary_reform_in_socioeconomic_development | role of revolutionary reform]] in socioeconomic changes.

## Potential Barriers to Moral Progress

Despite historical evidence of progress, Huemer acknowledges potential barriers. He discusses the status quo bias, where people have a natural inclination to prefer the current state of affairs simply because it exists [00:05:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">05:39</a>). Such biases can hinder the recognition and implementation of necessary moral changes.

Additionally, Huemer explores the possibility that significant moral truths may be challenging for humanity to fully understand, potentially limiting progress in reaching certain ethical ideals such as [[libertarianism_and_anarchocapitalism | anarcho-capitalism]] [00:25:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">25:31</a>).

> Huemer emphasizes that larger cultural shifts usually follow the influence of thought leaders or philosophical works, suggesting that if current trends continue, moral views such as vegetarianism and veganism will gain further acceptance, potentially leading to less animal suffering in the future [00:22:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">22:38</a>). This aligns with discussions on the [[ethical_considerations_in_technology | ethical considerations]] in promoting cultural shifts.

## Conclusion

The discussion with Huemer illustrates that while moral progress is evident and driven by strong ethical intuitions, it faces challenges from societal biases and the complexity of achieving deeper ethical truths. However, the persistent efforts of individuals advocating for change indicate that progress is not only possible but likely, given enough time and continued advocacy.

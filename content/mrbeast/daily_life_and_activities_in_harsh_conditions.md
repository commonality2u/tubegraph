Surviving 50 hours in Antarctica presents numerous [[challenges of extreme survival scenarios | challenges of extreme survival scenarios]], requiring constant adaptation to the environment and meticulous attention to daily tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The continent, located at the bottom of the globe, is known as the coldest place on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Initial Setup and Environmental Challenges

Upon arrival, the first priority was to trek towards mountains to gain some protection from the intense wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. A blizzard began shortly after landing, making conditions immediately severe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The temperature quickly dropped by 20 degrees, reaching negative 30 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## [[building_shelters_in_harsh_conditions | Building Shelters in Harsh Conditions]]

A crucial activity was the immediate construction of shelters to withstand the extreme cold and wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a> A common issue in Antarctica is extreme weather blowing away tents, so securing them was vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This involved cutting snow blocks to build a protective wall around the camp, known as "Camp Beast," to keep the tents safe from the wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Sustenance and Hygiene

Daily life revolved around basic survival needs:
*   **Eating:** Meals consisted of MREs (Meals, Ready-to-Eat) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Preparing them involved boiling water and carefully pouring it into the MRE packaging, which took about 10 minutes to be ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Human Waste:** Due to the need to preserve the environment, individuals could not simply urinate in the snow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. They had to use bottles for urination and carry them until the end of the trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. For defecation, a separate "poop tent" was set up away from the main camp, utilizing a bucket as a toilet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Sleep and Environmental Factors

Sleep was a major challenge due to the constant daylight and persistent wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The sun never set, making it difficult to determine night from day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Waking up on "morning one" was described as miserable, with individuals feeling sick and experiencing coughing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### Layering for Survival
To venture outside tents, extensive layering was essential to prevent frostbite, even with many layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This included:
*   Long pants and long-sleeved shirts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>
*   Multiple pairs of pants (up to three) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>
*   Multiple jackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>
*   A ski mask, gloves (including gloves for gloves), and goggles to protect eyeballs from freezing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>

## Expedition Activities

### Mountain Climbing
A significant activity was climbing an unnamed mountain, referred to as "Shopify Mountain" after its ascent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. The climb, which took four and a half hours, involved navigating a "sea of ice" and steep, dangerous cliffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. The views were described as otherworldly, feeling like a different planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Descending the mountain was also a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

### "Operation Hole"
While others were climbing, some members engaged in "Operation Hole," an ongoing project to dig a massive hole in the snow near their camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This hole eventually became eight feet deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Despite other productive tasks they could have done, they considered this the "best use of our time possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

## Departure and Environmental Responsibility

On the final day, extreme exhaustion made packing up camp incredibly difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. A critical rule for [[survival challenges | survival challenges]] in Antarctica is to "preserve the untouched beauty" and leave no trace of the camp behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This meant ensuring everything was packed out, including filling in the large hole that had been dug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. The group successfully completed the 50-hour challenge and returned home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

Competitive eating involves unique [[winning_strategies_in_competitions | strategies]] and mental fortitude, as demonstrated by the world's fastest competitive eater, Joey Chestnut, in a challenge against multiple opponents.

## The Challenge: Pizza Eating Contest
The competition involved eating the world's largest slice of pizza, which was literally six feet long and nine pounds in weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Joey Chestnut, weighing 229 pounds, competed against Mr. Beast, Chris, and Chandler, who collectively weighed 537 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The objective was for the team of three to finish their identical slice of pizza before Joey finished his <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Joey Chestnut's [[strategies_and_tactics_used_by_contestants | Eating Strategy]]
Joey Chestnut is renowned for holding numerous world records in competitive eating, including the hot dog eating record, and is considered the best eater in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. He holds 50 world records for eating various foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

During the pizza challenge, Joey demonstrated specific [[contestant_competition_strategies | strategies]]:
*   **Cutting and Folding:** Joey began by cutting his pizza and using a "foldy thing" technique to consume it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This method allows for faster ingestion of large quantities.
*   **Water for Swallowing:** He consistently used water to help get the food down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This is a common tactic in competitive eating to moisten and aid passage of dense food.
*   **Mental Toughness:** Joey remained "in the zone," likened to a "great white shark," unfazed by distractions or attempts to bribe him to stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. He was determined to finish and kick his opponents' butts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Encouragement from Opposition:** Surprisingly, the addition of more people to the opposing team encouraged Joey to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## Opponents' Struggles and Adjustments
Despite their numerical advantage, Mr. Beast and his friends struggled significantly:
*   **Initial Overconfidence:** They believed their combined weight and numbers would easily allow them to out-eat Joey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Lack of Technique:** Unlike Joey, they didn't employ specific [[decision_making_and_strategy_among_contestants | eating strategies]] or techniques, leading to difficulties in consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Physical Discomfort:** They quickly experienced fullness, nausea, and "pizza sweats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Adding More Eaters:** As Joey neared completion, the team resorted to adding more members, going from three to four, then five, and finally seven people against Joey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **Monetary Incentive:** A $100,000 prize was offered if they managed to beat Joey, providing a short-lived burst of motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

## Outcome
Joey Chestnut finished his nine-pound pizza slice, gaining 21 pounds during the challenge, increasing his weight from 229 pounds to 250 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. The opposing team, even with seven members, was nowhere near finishing their slice, having only gained 10 pounds collectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

Joey described the challenge as one of the hardest he had faced, noting the difficulty of the second half, but he maintained confidence in his ability to finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. He felt bloated and exhausted afterward, requiring recovery time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. The contest highlighted the extraordinary skill and specialized [[competition_dynamics_in_endurance_challenges | strategies]] required for competitive eating, proving that sheer numbers do not necessarily overcome the expertise of a world champion in [[unique_competition_formats | niche endurance challenges]].

This article details a unique [[survival_challenge_for_money | survival challenge for money]] where a subscriber attempts to live for 100 days within a defined circle for a cash prize.

## The Setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>
A giant circle was laid out in the middle of nowhere, with the goal for a random subscriber to stay inside it for 100 days to win $500,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The participant, Shawn, had a house dropped off by a crane, which contained all the food, clothes, and supplies needed for the 100 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Over a dozen cameras monitored his every move 24/7, and stepping on the red line marking the circle's boundary would result in disqualification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Shawn's Initial Strategy and Mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>
Shawn's immediate strategy involved organizing his supplies, which included 300,000 calories of food for the 100 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. He also planned to keep his mind entertained, as he believed he would regret it forever if he walked out of the circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Shawn quickly developed a routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a> and began weighing himself every seven days, aiming to be "ripped and $500,000 richer" by the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. He also planned to use the prize money to convert his farm entirely to solar power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

The hardest part of the [[survival_challenges | challenge]] for Shawn was being in his own head and the loneliness, especially since he had four kids and a wife, and this would be the most alone he had been in 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

## Notable Events and Challenges Faced

### Early Days (Pre-Day 50)
*   **House Issues**: Shawn's shower did not drain due to how the house was dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. He attempted to plant vegetables, being cautious of the red line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Weather**: Shawn refused to leave the circle despite a tornado watch, stating he was from Oklahoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Interference**: MrBeast's crew trapped Shawn's guests in his house, causing a mess and breaking glass, much to Shawn's frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Day 25: Carnival Celebration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>
To celebrate Shawn being 25% complete, a carnival was brought into the circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Despite the distraction, Shawn reaffirmed his commitment to completing the 100 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

### Food and Loneliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>
Shawn had to carefully ration his 300,000 calories of food, which led to "pretty interesting choices," including eating disgusting boiled leftovers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. He expressed that if anything would make him quit, it would be the loneliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. An incident with a spider led him to flip his bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### Day 39: Father's Day Surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>
On Father's Day, Shawn was emotional, missing his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. As a surprise, his family was brought to the circle and spent 24 hours with him inside the house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### Day 50: Temptation and Annoyance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>
On Day 50, Shawn was offered $100,000 in cash to leave the circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. He refused, stating he would only consider leaving for over $400,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. A marching band was then brought in to play all night to annoy him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

### Later Stages (After Day 50)
*   **July 4th**: Fireworks were set off inside the circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Moat and Idleness**: Shawn started digging a moat around the circle to create a secondary line, as he felt he was too close to the edge multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. He also reported running out of things to do, having already dug a moat, made a garden, a fire pit, a fence, and a hammock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. He started feeling "just existing" and primarily sleeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   **30-Day Absence**: Jimmy (MrBeast) did not visit Shawn for 30 days, during which Shawn lost 22 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **House Destruction**: With only days left, Shawn's house was cut in half by a chainsaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a> and later destroyed with a wrecking ball and excavator, removing the roof, leaving him exposed to potential rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.
*   **Final Temptation**: Shawn was offered $250,000 to leave with nine days remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. He refused, stating he would "rather die than give up" at that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
*   **Psychological Warfare**: Speakers were placed around the circle, playing various sounds to annoy Shawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. Additionally, clowns surrounded the house, staring at him silently all night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

## Conclusion of the Challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>
As the timer counted down to the final minutes, Shawn's emotions ran high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. He reflected on the value of life versus money, urging others to ensure they trade their life for things "worth it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. Upon the 100-day mark, Shawn stepped on the red line, officially ending the [[challenge_to_win_money | challenge to win money]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. He was reunited with his family and received a check for half a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

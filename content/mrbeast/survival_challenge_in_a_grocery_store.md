A unique [[survival_challenge_for_money | survival challenge for money]] involved an individual, Alex, being trapped inside an entire grocery store purchased by the host [00:00:00]. The store contained enough food to feed an entire city [00:00:03]. For every day Alex lived inside the grocery store, he would receive $10,000 [00:00:10]. The challenge had the potential to make Alex a multimillionaire if he stayed for years [00:00:18].

## Challenge Rules and Setup
The primary rule of the challenge was that Alex could not cross a red line painted around the entire perimeter of the grocery store [00:00:31]. Crossing this line would immediately end the [[game_mechanics_and_challenges_in_survival_scenarios | challenge]], and he would walk away with his current winnings [00:00:36]. Countless cameras covered every square inch of the store to ensure compliance [00:00:41].

## Daily Life and Initial Twist
Alex quickly established a "home base" in a corner of the grocery store [00:00:48]. On day one, he received his first $10,000 [00:00:58]. However, a twist was introduced: to receive the daily $10,000, Alex needed to provide $10,000 worth of product from the store in return [00:01:11]. This required him to strategize what items to get rid of to stay as long as possible [00:01:16].

Initially, Alex focused on non-essential, expensive items like electronics [00:01:23]. All items Alex sold for payment were donated to charity [00:02:37].

## Adaptations and Innovations
As days progressed, Alex became efficient at selecting items, selling produce on day five and diapers on day six, along with $30,000 worth of products between days seven and nine [00:02:42]. He discovered the backroom of the store [00:02:57] and, after 10 days without showering, built his own makeshift shower and laundry system [00:02:59].

By day 13, Alex upgraded his shower using shelves for reinforcement and plastic liner for waterproofing [00:04:48]. He also constructed walls for his shelter using all the water bottles in the store [00:05:35] and created a comfortable bed from toilet paper [00:05:41].

The host helped Alex acquire a forklift from the back of the store, significantly increasing his efficiency in moving and selling items [00:06:13]. This allowed him to upgrade his bed further [00:07:07].

## External Events and Motivation
During the challenge, the host traveled to film other videos, including one where he stranded himself on an [[survival_challenges_on_a_deserted_island | island]] [00:04:03] and another where he built 100 wells in Africa [00:12:01]. During these times, a "Money Man" or other crew members would deliver Alex's daily earnings [00:04:11].

Around day 30, Alex received a surprise visit from his wife and two sons [00:09:07]. This emotional reunion made him realize the toll the challenge was taking on his family life [00:10:07]. He initially aimed for $1 million [00:07:17] but adjusted his goal to $500,000 to avoid missing his sons' birthdays [00:07:37].

## Increasing Difficulties
A significant [[challenges_of_extreme_survival_scenarios | challenge]] arose when the electricity bill for the grocery store was intentionally left unpaid, leading to a complete power outage [00:08:55]. This meant freezers, lights, and most other systems ceased to function, except for cameras and cash registers which were on a generator [00:10:49]. This forced Alex to prioritize selling perishable frozen foods quickly [00:11:01].

The lack of power and constant darkness greatly affected Alex's morale [00:12:21]. He found an old lantern to provide some light [00:14:18], and the crew later brought in lights for filming [00:14:47].

The host's crew, in a prank, used the forklift to demolish shelves, creating a large mess for Alex to clean [00:15:04]. Alex then found and set up a swimming pool in the newly cleared space [00:15:19].

## Climax and Conclusion
Alex's mental state deteriorated due to loneliness and boredom [00:16:17]. During a routine operation, he accidentally crashed the forklift, bursting the pool and soaking his accumulated money and products [00:16:20]. This incident served as a breaking point, making him desire to leave [00:16:58].

On day 44, Alex noted the loneliness and difficulty of the challenge, especially with the power out [00:18:16]. On day 45, a robot delivered his daily money, further emphasizing his isolation [00:18:40].

With $450,000 earned, Alex's wife returned to help him make the final decision [00:20:10]. After weighing his options, Alex decided to end the [[challenge_to_survive_in_a_circle_for_cash_prize | challenge]] [00:20:45]. He stepped across the red line, officially completing his 45-day [[survival_challenges | survival challenge]] in the grocery store with $450,000 [00:21:10].

The grocery store challenge was supported by Albertsons, who helped fill the shelves [00:21:20], and Shopify, who helped pay for the store [00:11:13].

A video showcased a wide range of fireworks, from inexpensive individual pieces to the [[worlds_largest_firework | world's most expensive firework]], with over $600,000 spent on fireworks for the entire production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The video detailed the escalating costs and effects of different [[firework_safety_and_effects | fireworks]], providing a clear [[comparison_of_different_priced_mystery_boxes | comparison]] of their impact.

## Individual Firework Costs and Effects

The video began with smaller, more common fireworks, demonstrating their effects as their price increased:

*   **$1 Firework** - Described as "kind of lame" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **$10 Firework** - Showed a slightly better, more impactful effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **$50 Firework** - Demonstrated a noticeable step up in display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **$375 Firework** - Produced a "colorful" and "spectacular" display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **$1,000 Firework** - Consisted of nine combined boxes, creating a large, impressive explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Large-Scale Firework Displays

As the budget increased, so did the scale and complexity of the firework displays:

*   **$5,000 Firework** - A large firework was mentioned, costing $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.
*   **$10,000 Firework Show** - This was not a single firework but an entire show, described as an "entire show" rather than just one firework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. It included 4,000 shells launched simultaneously from what was originally a five-minute show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **$40,000 Firework** - This single firework was stated to contain over 9,000 shells, making it four times bigger than the $10,000 firework display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Its cost was compared to buying a car or a down payment on a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **$160,000 Firework** - This was described as the [[worlds_largest_firework | world's largest and most expensive firework]], weighing 4,000 pounds and requiring a 15-foot deep hole for launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>, and FAA clearance was needed for its launch due to its immense power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Its impact was felt 2,000 feet away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

## Other Explosive Experiments

Beyond traditional fireworks, the video also featured other explosive and pyrotechnic experiments:

*   **Rocket-Powered Mannequin** - A mannequin named Manny was strapped with 100 rockets to make him fly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Car Filled with Fireworks** - A car's trunk was filled with fireworks to observe the effects of an indoor firework explosion, leading to the car catching fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Microwaved Firework** - A firework was placed in a microwave to see if it would explode, which it did, destroying the microwave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Giant Sparkler Logo** - 520 sparklers were used to create a large logo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **150 Fireworks Launched Simultaneously** - A large quantity of smaller fireworks were launched at once to create a single massive display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   [[drone_light_shows | Drone Light Shows]] - Hundreds of drones were programmed to spell words and display symbols in the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

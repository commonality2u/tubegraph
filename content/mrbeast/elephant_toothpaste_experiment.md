The elephant toothpaste experiment is a large-scale chemical reaction that produces a significant volume of foam. This experiment is known for its impressive visual effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Overview
The experiment involves mixing specific chemicals to create a rapid decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, often catalyzed by potassium iodide, which generates a large amount of oxygen gas, creating the foam. The reaction produces a significant amount of heat, making the foam steamy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## The Experiment
The goal was to perform the world's largest elephant toothpaste experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The preparation involved containers holding 100 times the amount of chemicals typically used in a smaller demonstration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, resulting in an "explosion" 100 times bigger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Participants were instructed to find a safe spot before the reaction was initiated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

### Execution
After the command to "pull" was given, the foam began to erupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
> "Oh my God! Keep pulling! Pull harder! Oh God." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>

## Result and Record
The experiment successfully filled an entire pool with the elephant toothpaste foam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. The reaction also created a steamy appearance, with one observer noting, "It looks like the pool's on fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This event set a new [[achieving_an_elephant_toothpaste_world_record | world record]] for elephant foam toothpaste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Despite the heat and steam, participants expressed a desire to jump into the "forbidden swimming pool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

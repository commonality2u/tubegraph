Participants on a deserted island spent 24 hours straight trying to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Key tasks included setting up camp and creating shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Initial Setup and Challenges
Upon arrival, the group had no cell service and was isolated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Supplies brought included tents and chairs, among other items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

The immediate goal was to set up camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Chris declared his intention to "build the best tent you ever seen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Tareq noted that building a tent "took a very long time" for one participant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Tareq also jokingly stated that "the first step of building a tent is to complain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Chandler, who had [[outdoor_survival_skills|Boy Scout experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, was asked to help others with their tents but declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, although he was later seen working hard on a tent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Protecting the Camp
As the day progressed, the group faced challenges from rising water levels. They observed that the island was "getting small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a> due to the tide. To protect their tents and camp, they decided to "build a moat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. This strategy involved digging trenches to divert water away from the camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

Chris strategically placed his tent behind Vikin's tent to [[building_shelter_and_protection_against_the_wind|block the wind]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, a demonstration of [[building_shelters_in_harsh_conditions|building shelters in harsh conditions]].

## Making a Fire
Building a fire was crucial for food preparation. Chris, leveraging his [[outdoor_survival_skills|Boy Scout background]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, successfully built a fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. He explained the three essential elements for a fire: fuel, flame, and oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Despite challenges like sand and bird droppings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>, the fire was used to cook hot dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

## Camp Conditions and Departure
The [[improvements_in_camp_and_living_conditions|moat proved effective]], withstanding high tide and protecting the camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

After nearly 24 hours, the participants were exhausted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Sleep quality was poor; one participant slept terribly, finding sand uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>, while another slept in a chair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. The experience was described as "miserable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. They were eager for the boat to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. Before leaving, they ensured all items were packed up to avoid leaving a mess, which is important for the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. The boats eventually arrived, marking the end of their island stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

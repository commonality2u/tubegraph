In a unique social experiment, random individuals were given a [[use_of_credit_cards_for_unexpected_purchases | credit card]] with an undisclosed spending limit, challenged to buy whatever they desired with the caveat that if they exceeded the limit, they would receive nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Unknown to the participants, the [[use_of_credit_cards_for_unexpected_purchases | card]] actually had no limit and could technically be used to spend a [[spending_a_million_dollars_in_24_hours | million dollars]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This setup aimed to observe how perceived financial boundaries influence [[shopping_sprees_for_individuals_in_need | shopping sprees]] and decision-making.

## Shopping Scenarios and Perceived Limits

Participants consistently underestimated the true purchasing power of the [[use_of_credit_cards_for_unexpected_purchases | credit card]], leading to cautious [[strategies_for_spending_large_sums_quickly | spending strategies]] and [[moral_dilemmas_in_money_challenges | moral dilemmas]] about whether to risk exceeding the unknown limit.

### Target Store
The first challenge took place in Target, a store noted for having "a history of kicking us out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Participants were told there was a secret limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Perceived Limit:** One participant initially guessed the limit was "Like, 200?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Purchases:** Despite encouragement to buy larger items like a TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, they remained conservative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, eventually adding a TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a> and an iPad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Total Spent:** The total for their items was $5,915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Reaction:** Upon approval, participants were shocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> and visibly emotional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> before learning the [[use_of_credit_cards_for_unexpected_purchases | card]] was truly unlimited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Lego Store
At the Lego store, participants were again presented with the unknown limit challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Purchases:** They selected multiple large Lego sets, including the Statue of Liberty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a> and the Millennium Falcon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Total Spent:** The Lego haul totaled $3,494.90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Reaction:** Approval brought cheers and excitement, with one participant stating, "I literally expected it to be declined" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Designer Store
In a designer store where items cost thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, participants had to decide what to buy.
*   **Perceived Limit:** One person estimated the limit to be "5,000?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Another inferred it might be close to "$9,999" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Purchases:** Items considered or bought included a $500 wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, an $850 hoodie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, $330 shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, a $600 tee shirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, and $1,100 "Scott's" shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Spending Strategy:** They were very careful to stay under their perceived $5,000 limit, even removing a shirt to avoid going over by $13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Total Spent:** The final total was under $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Reaction:** The individual was "speechless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a> and "glowing inside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a> upon approval, again unaware the limit was nonexistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### Art Gallery (First Date)
A couple on their first date was given the [[use_of_credit_cards_for_unexpected_purchases | card]] in an art gallery, creating a unique and unexpected scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Perceived Limit:** One person suggested "$100K?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, but decided to "keep below 10,000" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   **Purchases:** They considered a New York piece for $18,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, a "Crash" piece for $7,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, a Joker piece for $26,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, and an eye piece for $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. They eventually chose two pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, including one for $7,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Total Spent:** The final purchase amount was $15,786.87 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Reaction:** Both were thrilled by the unexpected and successful purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, describing the date as "unexpected, but I love it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

### Jewelry Store
A man was given the [[use_of_credit_cards_for_unexpected_purchases | card]] in a jewelry store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. He revealed his mother had Stage 4 cancer and wished to buy her a necklace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **Purchases:** He selected a necklace for his mother, priced at approximately $6,900 (or 7 grand with taxes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, and a pinky ring for $2,950 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. The jeweler offered all three for $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Total Spent:** The final cost was $8,999.99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **Reaction:** He was "so very blessed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a> to be able to buy something for his mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>, emphasizing the emotional significance of the purchase.

### Car Dealership
A familiar face, Andre, who had helped with previous videos, was given the [[use_of_credit_cards_for_unexpected_purchases | card]] at a car dealership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   **Perceived Limit:** He estimated the limit to be "10, 11" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a> (presumably thousands).
*   **Purchases:** He chose a Toyota car for $15,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. He then FaceTimed his partner of 25 years to share the news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   **Total Spent:** The car was priced at $15,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

*   **Reaction:** Andre was "completely flabbergasted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a> and deeply grateful for the life-changing gift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

### Restaurant (Tip Challenge)
A waiter was offered the chance to write any tip amount on the [[use_of_credit_cards_for_unexpected_purchases | credit card]], with the understanding that if it went over the limit, the meal would be paid with a different [[use_of_credit_cards_for_unexpected_purchases | card]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.
*   **Perceived Limit/Strategy:** The waiter called the idea of a $5,000 tip "absurd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>, but ultimately wrote a tip of $1,575 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

## Conclusion

Across all scenarios, individuals approached the challenge with caution, consistently underestimating the true spending power of the [[use_of_credit_cards_for_unexpected_purchases | credit card]]. The perceived limit created a sense of risk and [[moral_dilemmas_in_money_challenges | moral dilemmas]], leading many to hold back from buying more expensive items they desired. The revelation of the "no limit" policy often resulted in disbelief and regret for not having spent more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>, highlighting the psychological impact of perceived financial constraints on [[strategies_for_spending_large_sums_quickly | spending strategies]] and generosity. This experiment demonstrates the fascinating dynamics of [[spending_and_generosity_in_unexpected_situations | spending and generosity in unexpected situations]] when faced with an unknown financial ceiling.

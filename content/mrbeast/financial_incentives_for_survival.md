This article details a [[survival_challenges | survival challenge]] in the wilderness where two strangers, Hase and Grizz, were offered [[financial_incentives_for_survival | financial incentives]] to endure the elements for an extended period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The challenge explored how [[moneybased_competitions_and_incentives | money-based competitions]] and [[prize_incentives_and_participant_decisions | prize incentives]] influenced participant decisions and their [[incentives_and_motivations_in_challenges | motivations]] to continue.

## Challenge Overview
Two strangers, Hase and Grizz, who had never met before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, were dropped into the wilderness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For every day they survived, they would receive $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This setup allowed for the theoretical possibility of winning [[moneybased_competitions_and_incentives | unlimited money]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The only way to end the [[survival_challenge_for_money | challenge]] was by firing a flare gun, after which they would leave with the money they had earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Initial Goals and Challenges
Upon learning the daily rate, Hase stated, "3.6 million for the year is crazy," and the initial plan was to stay for a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. They began by focusing on basic [[survival_tactics | survival tactics]], such as finding a camping spot, building a fire, and managing their initial supplies, which included approximately five days of food, two water containers, a change of clothes, warm jackets, and a fire starter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

After their first night, which was cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, they received their first $10,000 via a parachuted briefcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. They initially agreed to split all winnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## [[participant_incentives_and_offers | Participant Incentives and Offers]]
Throughout the [[challenges_and_survival_strategies | challenge]], various [[participant_incentives_and_offers | offers]] were presented to Hase and Grizz, testing their resolve and attachment to the accumulating prize money.

### Day 10: Food and Supplies
By day 10, the participants were "extremely hungry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, having been without fresh food for several days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. An offer was made: an additional ten days worth of food, spices, two tarps, and fishing equipment for $50,000 of their prize money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. They accepted, viewing it as a necessary deal despite the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, with Hase noting the cost was equivalent to his "kid's college tuition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Day 20: Sleeping Bags
After suffering from cold nights and lack of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, they were offered sleeping bags. The offer was $10,000 for one sleeping bag or $50,000 for two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Despite the impending colder weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>, they declined both options, believing they had adapted to the cold and didn't want to spend $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### Day 30: The Wilderness "Dollar Store"
Having survived an entire month, they were presented with a "store" offering items like firewood, a shovel, cooking supplies, bedding, books, and board games, with each item costing $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Even though they had accumulated $240,000 by this point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>, they refused to buy anything, believing they could improvise with parachutes or didn't need the items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

### Day 40: Family Visit
With rations dangerously low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>, the most significant offer was presented on day 40: for $10,000, both participants could see their wives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. They immediately accepted this offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. While the visit was nice, it was bittersweet, as their wives expressed a desire for them to come home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Hase specifically stated he wanted to stay until he had $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, indicating his [[incentives_and_motivations_in_challenges | motivation]] remained strong.

### Day 50: The Boat
After Hase built a makeshift boat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>, they were offered a Zaxby's-branded boat for $50,000, later discounted to $40,000 since they had just built their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. Grizz declined the offer, stating his trust in Hase's homemade vessel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

## Shifting [[incentives_and_temptation_during_challenges | Incentives and Temptation]]
As the [[survival_challenges | challenge]] continued, the participants faced increasing personal and physical strain. Lack of sleep, hunger, and isolation led to irritability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. Hase's desire to return to his family, particularly his newborn son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>, grew stronger. He expressed that he had "spent more time in the wilderness than I have with my newborn son" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

### The Decision to End
Despite having a target of $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, Hase openly discussed wanting to end the challenge with Grizz around day 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. He felt the money no longer mattered and that his family needed him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. Grizz, initially pushing to stay longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a> and aiming for a higher prize amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>, eventually prioritized their friendship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>.

> "I just don't want to let you down." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>
> "You're not letting me down. Brothers don't let each other down." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>
> "Everything's got to come to an end sometime. Let me see that flare. I owe you this." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>

Grizz gave Hase permission to fire the flare, ending the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>.

## Outcome
After 74 days in the wilderness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>, Hase and Grizz won a total of $670,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.

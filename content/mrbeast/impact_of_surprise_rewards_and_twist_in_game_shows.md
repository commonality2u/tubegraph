In a competition where 100 people vie for a grand prize of $500,000 by being the last to remain inside a giant circle, various [[surprise_rewards_and_risktaking_in_games | surprise rewards]] and twists were introduced to test endurance, alter dynamics, and encourage strategic decisions among contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These elements had a significant [[impact_of_surprises_and_moral_lessons_in_competitions | impact on the participants' morale]], decisions, and the overall progression of the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Unforeseen Prizes for Early Exits

Initially, the goal was to be the last person remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. However, a significant twist was introduced early on when the first contestant to voluntarily leave the circle received a brand new car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This created a paradoxical [[prize_distribution_and_surprise_outcomes | outcome]] where "being a loser would pay off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

*   **Impact**: This [[surprise_prizes_and_offers_for_participants | surprise prize]] served as a "massive morale boost" for those remaining, as it suggested that weakness could lead to quick exits, reducing the competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. It also wore down a few people, knowing that random prizes could be won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Mid-Game Comforts and Temptations

As days progressed, the game show producers introduced elements aimed at both comfort and temptation.

*   **Gourmet Food**: Contestants were provided with filet mignon, which increased their willingness to stay longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Voluntary Exit Offers**: Throughout the challenge, specific offers were made to incentivize contestants to leave.
    *   One contestant was offered a brand new iPhone for stepping out, which they accepted due to needing a new phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
    *   Later offers included $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>, and later $10,001 for getting out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. One contestant even received a PlayStation 5 in addition to $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
    *   **Impact**: These offers created internal conflict, with some taking the money and experiencing immediate joy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>, while others regretted not taking the offer later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

## Dynamic Environmental Twists

The core "circle" element underwent continuous changes, adding pressure and creating new challenges.

*   **Shrinking Circle**: At the end of each day, the circle was shrunk, reducing the available space for contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This twist immediately caused some people to "crack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   **Individual Quadrants**: On Day 11, the circle was drastically reduced, and contestants were assigned individual small circles of grass to stand on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. This made staying significantly harder, pushing several contestants to their limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

## Strategic Distractions and Challenges

To further reduce the number of contestants and create entertaining scenarios, several [[surprise_elements_and_distractions_during_the_challenge | surprise elements]] and mini-challenges were introduced:

*   **Soccer Goal**: A soccer goal was placed inside the circle to tempt contestants, hoping they would mess up and touch the line while playing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This successfully eliminated a contestant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Music/Noise**: Various sounds, like a 10-hour alarm loop and a 10-hour loop of a man screaming, were played to induce boredom and annoyance, though this didn't immediately cause exits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Tesla Challenge**: To celebrate surviving a week, a challenge was set up to win a Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Contestants had to ride a board across a tarp and touch the car without touching the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. This challenge led to several exits, including one contestant who stepped on the line but received $5,000 for putting others first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>, and another winning the Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Mystery Wheel**: A mystery wheel offered random prizes or punishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. One contestant, David, repeatedly won cash prizes from it, highlighting the [[prize_distribution_and_surprise_outcomes | unpredictability of outcomes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Balloon Wall**: A wall of balloons contained various [[surprise_giveaways_and_prizes | surprise giveaways]] and punishments, such as a go-kart, $2,000, a blanket, or having to tape feet to someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. This led to varied reactions and new temporary conditions for contestants.
*   **Magic Eight Ball**: Contestant David, known for his luck, asked a Magic Eight Ball if he should leave, which responded "yes." He then exited with an additional $5,000, on top of the $19,000 he had already won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. This demonstrated how [[impact_of_winning_on_contestants_lives | surprise outcomes]] can lead to a positive conclusion even for those who don't win the main prize.
*   **Duct Taping Pairs & Standing Rule**: On day nine, contestants were duct-taped together in pairs and forbidden from sitting down for the entire day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. This twist caused immediate elimination for one contestant who stepped on the line during the explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

## Final Twist: A Multi-Part Challenge

After 12 days, with only the top 10 contestants remaining, the ultimate twist was revealed: the video was only "part number one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. The final winner of the $500,000 would be determined by a game of tag in a separate video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. This unexpected conclusion defied the initial premise of the "last one in the circle" challenge, extending the competition and creating anticipation.

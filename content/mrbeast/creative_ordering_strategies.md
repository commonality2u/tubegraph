Participants in a challenge to drive through a Hardee's drive-thru 1,000 times employed a variety of [[winning_strategies|creative ordering strategies]] to complete their objective and avoid having to work at the restaurant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. These [[high_stakes_challenge_strategies|high-stakes challenge strategies]] included adapting their mode of transport, modifying order contents, and streamlining the payment process as part of their overall [[contestant_competition_strategies|contestant competition strategies]] and [[creative_approaches_in_winning_prizes|creative approaches in winning prizes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Diverse Modes of Transport for Orders

To increase the speed of completing laps, the participants diversified their vehicles beyond a standard car:
*   **Lawn Mower** One contestant, Chris, used a lawn mower to go through the drive-thru and offered to mow grass for payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Golf Cart** Mr. Beast utilized a golf cart for his turns, even skipping the line at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Bicycle** Another participant, Chris, rode a "girl's bike" through the drive-thru <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Limo** To allow for rest and more space, a limousine was rented, enabling participants to nap while still completing laps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **Multiple Cars** As time ran short, additional cars were enlisted to drive through simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## Strategic Ordering for Efficiency and Donation

The type of items ordered changed significantly throughout the challenge, demonstrating [[adapting_brand_promotions_in_highintensity_scenarios|adaptation to the high-intensity scenario]]:
*   **Initial Full Orders** Early in the challenge, standard meals like a "number six" were ordered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   **Minimal Orders** To save time and prevent food waste, participants switched to ordering only bottles of water and orange juice, which could then be donated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Bulk Food for Donation** Large quantities of food, including entire menu items, were ordered for donation to a local middle school, the police department, and a hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

## Unconventional Ordering and Pranks

Participants also utilized [[creative_rules_for_winning_prizes|creative rules for winning prizes]] by engaging in less conventional ordering tactics:
*   **Ordering by Alphabet** One contestant ordered menu items and food components alphabetically, starting with "apple sauce" and ending with "zero Coke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **Specific Components** Individual components of a meal, such as a bun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>, a patty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, 10 pickles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, and a slice of cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>, were ordered separately to construct a custom burger later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   **Burger Drive-By** The custom-built burger was used in a "burger drive-by" prank, thrown at an employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Bathroom Breaks** The drive-thru was even used as a "rest stop" for a contestant needing a bathroom break, prompting questions about whether the lap still counted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

## Streamlining Payment

To speed up the process, a single credit card was given to the drive-thru staff, allowing them to charge it automatically for each lap without the need for swiping every time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

This was evident in their interactions, self-deprecating jokes, and reactions to each other's successes and failures.

## Early Grades: Introductions and First Eliminations

From the very beginning, the participants introduced themselves with humorous facts. MrBeast stated he doesn't like school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, Chandler liked Gushers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, and Garrett highlighted that his dad owns a yacht <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

After the first grade test, the entire group successfully passed, celebrating their collective advancement to second grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This initial shared success fostered a sense of [[competitive_teamwork | collective achievement]].

The first instance of a participant failing occurred in second grade when Chandler missed three questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Despite his elimination, the group engaged in lighthearted teasing, with MrBeast joking that "Chandler's just dumb" and that he "failed second grade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Chandler humorously claimed he was "trying to get two wrong on purpose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Following his "punishment" by water balloons, the remaining participants expressed affection, with calls of "We love you Chandler" and a group hug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This demonstrated strong [[interpersonal_dynamics_and_reactions_during_contests | interpersonal dynamics]] and support within the group.

## Mid-Challenge Interactions

As the challenge progressed, the humor continued:
*   Upon Chandler's elimination, the new teacher announced, "your friend Chandler had been held back, the weakest link had to go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, reinforcing the playful competitive spirit.
*   MrBeast, while succeeding, openly admitted, "I suck at school but if you want help with clickbait thumbnails I'm your guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   After Garrett's elimination in fifth grade, he lightheartedly remarked, "I lost but I'm glad I got hit with water cuz it reminds me of being on my dad's yacht" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, referencing his earlier humorous introduction.

## Later Stages and Finalists

*   After Jimmy's elimination in seventh grade, he candidly admitted, "I only fail because of spelling which I am terrible at" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   When Chris failed 11th grade, he also faced the water balloon punishment. Afterward, he admitted, "I passed 11th grade though unlike in real life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>, showcasing self-aware humor.

## Conclusion: Shared Victory and Continued Mirth

In the final 12th grade test, with only Bailey remaining to secure the grand prize, the tension was cut by the participants' [[teamwork_and_alliances_during_competitive_events | supportive]] and humorous reactions. After Bailey successfully passed, the group embraced him in a congratulatory hug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. The video concluded with a final quip from MrBeast, stating, "I'll see you guys in summer school" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>, maintaining the lighthearted tone to the very end.

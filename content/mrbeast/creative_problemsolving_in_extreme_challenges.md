In various extreme challenges, participants like Blake have demonstrated remarkable [[Creative problemsolving in extreme challenges | creative problem-solving]] under immense pressure to protect valuable assets and win significant prizes. These [[High Stakes Challenges | high-stakes challenges]] often involve overcoming seemingly insurmountable obstacles with limited time and resources.

## The Lamborghini Protection Challenge

Blake was tasked with protecting a quarter-million-dollar Lamborghini from a series of destructive phases within strict 24-hour time limits for each phase [00:00:20]. The ultimate prize included the Lamborghini itself and an additional $100,000 [00:02:26].

### Phase 1: 10,000 Bullets

Blake's first challenge was to shield the Lamborghini from 10,000 bullets fired by eight soldiers [00:00:12].

**Strategy and Execution:**
Blake initially planned a multi-layered defense comprising a wall of cinder blocks, shipping containers filled with refrigerators, and a wall of cars [00:00:26]. He spent $78,000 on supplies [00:00:44]. As the 24-hour timer progressed, he continuously adapted his strategy:
*   He used a storage container as the first line of defense [00:01:12].
*   Recognizing the initial setup was insufficient, he worked through the night to upgrade his fortifications [00:01:38].
*   He strategically incorporated railroad ties [00:01:43].
*   He filled a storage container with a van and a giant tube [00:01:51].
*   A key element of his defense was a concrete wall, with its tallest section positioned in the center to specifically block high-impact "crow's nest machine guns" [00:01:58].
*   He also utilized cars and water stored within containers [00:02:05].

**Outcome:** Despite the intensity of the barrage, the Lamborghini emerged unscathed, with no bullet holes [00:04:15].

### Phase 2: 100-Foot Drop

The second phase involved catching the Lamborghini after it was dropped from a height of 100 feet by a giant crane, without it being destroyed [00:03:37].

**Strategy and Execution:**
Blake's initial supplies from Phase 1 (concrete, metal) were unsuitable for cushioning a fall [00:05:47]. Inspired by a construction worker's suggestion of "bouncy castles" [00:05:22], Blake devised a new plan:
*   He arranged CONEX containers in a square formation [00:05:33].
*   He then filled this square with a variety of soft, shock-absorbing materials: air mattresses, pillows, bubble wrap, and bouncy castles [00:05:37].
*   His crew was sent to acquire "every pillow and air mattress in the city" [00:05:54].
*   He also added cardboard boxes to his protective pit [00:07:06].
*   In a last-ditch effort, he attempted to directly wrap the suspended Lamborghini in bubble wrap from a crane, though this proved impractical [00:07:18].

**Outcome:** The Lamborghini survived the 100-foot fall, incurring only a minor crack in the bumper [00:09:10]. An appraiser determined this damage would reduce its value by approximately $10,000 [00:09:16].

### Phase 3: 10 Flaming Cars

This phase was a "flaming cars challenge," a recreation of a previous event that cost Blake $500,000 [00:09:31]. This time, twice as many flaming cars were dropped [00:09:40].

**Strategy and Execution:**
Learning from past mistakes, Blake prioritized non-flammable materials and [[Creative elimination tactics | deflection]]:
*   His primary defense involved cutting out the bottom of a shipping container to surround the Lamborghini [00:10:01].
*   He meticulously removed all flammable wood from within the container, which had been a critical error in his previous attempt [00:10:17].
*   He then positioned two more shipping containers to form a "V" shape above the car, designed to deflect the impact of the falling cars [00:10:05]. A "pointy thing" was added at the top to aid deflection [00:10:01].
*   He also added dirt and concrete to his setup [00:11:17].

**Outcome:** The Lamborghini survived, despite the intense heat and impact that caused the protective crate to bow and buckle [00:14:17].

### Phase 4: The Train Impact

The final and most formidable challenge involved stopping a massive train from impacting the Lamborghini [00:15:11]. Blake aimed to derail the train by just two inches to win [00:15:51].

**Strategy and Execution:**
Blake's approach was to create a substantial obstacle to derail the train:
*   He utilized railroad ties, which had previously caused him to lose a challenge, this time aiming for them to be his solution [00:15:47]. He planned to place "a hundred more times" under the train [00:15:43].
*   His team stacked cars, which had been dropped in Phase 3, onto the train tracks [00:16:22].
*   He added more shipping containers to the tracks [00:16:34].
*   He also incorporated mattresses to cushion impacts and water tanks [00:16:37].
*   He used resources from previous phases, such as the shipping containers from Phase 1 and mattresses from Phase 2, and even the burning cars from Phase 3 [00:17:07].

**Outcome:** Blake successfully derailed the train [00:18:20], winning the Lamborghini and the $100,000 prize [00:18:35]. His victory highlights the importance of [[The psychology of overcoming extreme challenges | learning from failures]] and adapting strategies in [[High stakes challenge strategies | high-stakes challenges]].

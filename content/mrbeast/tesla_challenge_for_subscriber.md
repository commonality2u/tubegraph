The 40 millionth subscriber received a unique [[surprise_for_40_millionth_subscriber | surprise]] involving 40 cars and a subsequent challenge to win a custom Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The creator used a list of recent subscribers provided by YouTube to identify and message the 40 millionth subscriber, Luke, informing him only that he had a surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The collection of 40 cars included various models such as a Porsche, a Chrysler, a Tesla with a custom "40 mil" wrap, and even a SpongeBob car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The value of these cars exceeded $300,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. All 40 cars were loaded onto haulers for a 10-hour drive to Luke's location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## The Challenge

Upon arrival, Luke was blindfolded and led outside to witness the delivery of the first car, discovering the immense surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. While Luke did not believe the surprise was real, he was presented with all 40 cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Since Luke did not need 40 cars, he was presented with a [[extreme_challenges_for_subscribers | challenge]] to give away all 40 vehicles in under 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. If successful, he would win the custom-wrapped Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The last nine cars were kept covered, and were designed to be difficult to give away, making the challenge harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Giving Away the Cars

Luke began by giving cars to his family and friends, including his brother Jake, his 10-year-old little brother Ben (with Luke driving it off the lot), and his parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Friends like Carson also received cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. He then expanded his efforts, giving cars to his grandparents and great aunt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Many recipients expressed disbelief initially, with some only believing the gift upon recognizing the creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Viewers were encouraged to support creators by subscribing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

To accelerate the giveaway, Luke and the crew went to public places. At Walmart, they approached random strangers and offered them cars, which was initially met with skepticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. At Zaxby's, a car was given away using a "pick a number" game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. One recipient, a college-bound individual, found the car to be a "perfect gift" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Luke also gave a car to Steve, who works for his dad, stating that "nobody deserves a car more than he does" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

### The Wacky Cars

As the challenge neared its end, Luke tackled the "wackier" cars that had been kept under tarps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Recipients had to choose a car without knowing what was under the tarp. These included:
*   A Jurassic Park Jeep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   A "monster" car that appeared to be three trucks glued together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. This car was also filled with PlayStations as an additional reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
*   A car that ran out of gas immediately upon being started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   A car that was not drivable and had money in the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
*   A car that was functional but difficult to drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
*   A dune buggy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

The final car to be given away was Karl's own car, which the creator had previously destroyed and replaced, but Karl sold the replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. Karl reluctantly gave his car to "Little J" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

## Success and Reward

Luke successfully gave away all 40 cars in under 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. As a reward for completing the challenge, Luke received the custom-wrapped Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. The event was described as ending with "everybody happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

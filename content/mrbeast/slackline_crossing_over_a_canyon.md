A participant was tasked with crossing a 1000-foot tall canyon on a slackline to win a cash prize [03:47].

## The Challenge
The challenge involved crossing a canyon suspended at a height of 1000 feet on a slackline [03:47]. The participant's goal was to reach the end of the line where a $20,000 prize was located [04:01], while the host's goal was for the participant not to fall [04:04].

## Participant's Experience
The participant expressed terror at the prospect of the [[overcoming_fear_of_heights | challenge]] [03:50]. They noted nervousness due to the inconsistent wind, which kept picking up and slowing down [03:58]. Despite this, they descended onto the slackline [04:07]. The host observed that the participant was "fearless" [04:18] and "so focused" [04:53] during the crossing.

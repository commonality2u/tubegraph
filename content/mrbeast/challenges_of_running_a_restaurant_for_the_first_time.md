Opening a [[opening_a_free_restaurant_experience | free restaurant]] and even [[giving_away_cash_and_prizes_to_restaurant_customers | paying people to eat]] presents unique [[challenges_and_survival_strategies | challenges]], especially for those without prior experience in the culinary or service industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The initial venture into the restaurant business proved to be more difficult than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Unforeseen Demand and Traffic Issues

Upon opening, the restaurant experienced an overwhelming turnout, with police reporting a mile of traffic and a thousand cars in line even before the official opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This massive demand was unexpected, as the address was never publicly shared, with people reportedly coming due to seeing the billboard out front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

The line of cars quickly became problematic:
*   **Blocking Traffic** The sheer volume of cars led to traffic being blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Car Incidents** Some customers experienced issues while waiting, including cars running out of gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a> and even getting side-swiped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
*   **Early Closure** Due to holding up traffic, the local police, who were helpful and understanding, advised closing the restaurant early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

## Operational Hurdles

Running the restaurant involved numerous operational difficulties, largely due to a lack of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

### Cooking and Production
*   **Difficulty of Cooking** Cooking was found to be "way harder than I thought it was" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Keeping Up with Demand** The team struggled to keep up with the high demand for burgers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, resulting in long waiting times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### Staffing and Organization
*   **Inexperience** The restaurant was initially staffed by people with no prior experience in making food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, leading to an "unorganized restaurant full of people that have no idea what they're doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **Need for Backup** The overwhelming crowd necessitated calling friends for backup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, and eventually bringing in an "army" of professional chefs to help meet demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### Logistics and Supplies
*   **Running Out of Supplies** The restaurant frequently ran out of essential items like napkins, sometimes replacing them with money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **Financial Strain** The act of [[giving_away_cash_and_prizes_to_restaurant_customers | giving away cash and prizes]] to customers, including hundreds of thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, iPads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, and even a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, put a significant financial strain on the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Stress and Safety
*   **Stressful Environment** Operating a fast-food environment proved to be very stressful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Public Safety Concerns** Giving away large sums of money in public, surrounded by hundreds of people, raised safety concerns for the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

## Preparation and Mindset

Starting hungry is crucial, as it primes both the body and mind for the intense food consumption ahead. Moreover, Joey seemed highly focused, entering what can be described as a "zone" or a state of intense concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Efficient Eating Techniques

The mechanics of eating efficiently are essential in [[competitive_eating]]. Joey began by cutting the pizza into manageable pieces, which allowed for continuous and quicker consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This technique ensures a steady pace and prevents bloating and discomfort from consuming large, unwieldy bites.

Joey also utilized the "water trick," where he took sips of water to help swallow food faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. This method not only speeds up the eating process but also keeps the mouth lubricated, easing the passage of more dense foods like dough.

## Mental Fortitude and Endurance

The mental aspect of competitive eating cannot be overstated. Throughout the challenge, Joey maintained a positive and determined attitude. When questioned about finishing, he responded with unwavering confidence: "I'm gonna finish it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Such mental toughness is critical, especially when one's physical limits are being tested.

Furthermore, competitive eating involves enduring discomfort. Joey experienced bloating and exhaustion, yet continued to push forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. His ability to find a rhythm, as he mentioned, allowed him to manage his pace and energy levels throughout the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

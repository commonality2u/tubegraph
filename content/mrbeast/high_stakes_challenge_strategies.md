In a series of [[high_stakes_challenges | high stakes challenges]] designed by MrBeast, contestant Mack employed various strategies to navigate traps and secure increasing sums of money, with the goal of winning $1,000,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. His approach often involved quick thinking, adaptation, and an understanding of the challenge's mechanics.

## Adapting to Immediate Threats
*   **Trap 1: Cage Escape** – Faced with a closing cage and a high roof, Mack's initial strategy involved breaking a chair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a> to aid his escape and subsequent climb to the roof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   **Trap 3: Boulder Chase** – After correctly deducing that a boulder would pursue him upon grabbing the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, Mack's strategy was simply to run quickly through the exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## Navigating Complex Obstacles
*   **Trap 2: Laser Grid** – To avoid touching the lasers that would close the exit door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, Mack opted to crawl on the floor, a move anticipated by the host <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. He also inquired about time limits to gather information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a> and asked the host to move for a clearer path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Trap 4: Life-Sized Video Game in a Ball** – Encased in a large ball, Mack had to balance and jump across platforms within a 5-minute time limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. He demonstrated quick execution, obliterating the final stage in just 10 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Mack noted that balancing in the ball multiplied movements, making it harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Trap 7: High Balance Beam** – To overcome his fear of heights and traverse a thin balance beam 200 feet in the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, Mack decided to stop overthinking and just proceed: "I can't think about anymore. It is what it is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

## Problem-Solving and Information Gathering
*   **Trap 5: Underwater Lock Picking** – To save his money from a bonfire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, Mack had to swim through an underwater chamber and pick four locks using a clothes hanger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The challenge involved managing limited oxygen and decreasing visibility as he went deeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   **Trap 8: Squid Game Cookie Challenge** – This challenge combined elements of *Squid Game*, requiring Mack to cut out precise shapes from honeycomb cookies without breaking them to open doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
    *   **Strategy**: Mack employed a tactic from *Squid Game* by licking the cookie to melt the sugar, hoping to poke a needle through more easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. He consciously took his time for the first shape, a circle, due to the high stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.
    *   **Adaptation**: When facing the difficult umbrella shape with a 10-minute timer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>, Mack used a stack of money as a hammer, a non-traditional tool not seen in *Squid Game* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. He also tried using his shoe as a hammer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

## Risk Assessment
Throughout the [[High Stakes Challenges | challenges]], Mack was repeatedly given the option to walk away with his winnings or risk them for a higher prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. While he sometimes expressed hesitation or regret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>, his overall [[strategies in highstakes games | strategy]] was to continue for more money, driven by the proximity to $1,000,000 and the perceived audience expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. The host sometimes used psychological [[motivational_strategies_to_endure_challenges | strategies to endure challenges]], claiming the next trap would be easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a> to encourage him to continue. Ultimately, Mack lost everything at $700,000 in the cookie challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>, leading the host to advise future contestants to "quit while you're ahead" in a MrBeast video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.

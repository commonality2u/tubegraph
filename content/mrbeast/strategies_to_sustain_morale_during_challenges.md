In a high-stakes endurance contest, 100 individuals were placed within a giant circle, with the last person remaining winning $500,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The challenge demanded significant [[psychological_resilience_in_prolonged_contests | psychological resilience]] and the implementation of various [[strategies_in_endurance_challenges | strategies to endure challenges]], both by the contestants and the organizers, to either sustain or break morale over a period spanning many days.

## Initial Motivation and Commitment

Upon learning of the $500,000 prize, contestants expressed strong initial [[incentives_and_motivations_in_challenges | motivation]] and commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Many had cleared their schedules for weeks or even months in anticipation of the challenge's duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. One contestant even took off work until January 1st, six months away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The sheer scale of the initial 100 participants also highlighted the potential for a long haul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Organizer's Strategies to Influence Morale

Mr. Beast and his team employed several [[high_stakes_challenge_strategies | strategies]] to influence contestant morale, sometimes to break it, and other times to manage it:

*   **Incentives for Early Exit:**
    *   The first person to leave the circle was unexpectedly awarded a brand new car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This tactic, designed to reduce the number of participants, also created a "massive morale boost" for those who remained, as they perceived it as a sign of weakness in others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
    *   Later offers for participants to leave in exchange for cash (e.g., a new iPhone for leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, or $10,000 for stepping out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>, later $10,001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>) aimed to thin the ranks by providing tangible immediate rewards.
*   **Managing Comfort and Basic Needs:**
    *   Providing meals, such as filet mignon, aimed to keep contestants comfortable and reduce immediate grievances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. One contestant noted, "If they're gonna be feeding us like this, I could be here like for the rest of the year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
    *   However, sometimes the food quality was poor (e.g., oatmeal described as "wet cardboard") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, contributing to lower morale.
*   **Introducing Physical Constraints and Boredom:**
    *   **Shrinking the Circle:** At the end of each day, the circle was progressively shrunk, reducing the available space for contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. This created tension and forced people closer together. By day 10, the circle was "messed up completely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. By day 11, contestants were confined to individual small grass circles, "barely bigger than his foot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.
    *   **Imposing Rules:** New rules were introduced, such as no sitting down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a> and strict adherence to not touching outside the line, even a single blade of grass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.
    *   **Noise Harassment:** Karl, a member of Mr. Beast's team, attempted to break contestant morale through irritating noises, including a 10-hour alarm clock loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a> and a 10-hour loop of a man screaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This was an overt attempt to induce frustration and encourage exits.
    *   **Lack of Activities:** As the challenge progressed, boredom became a significant factor affecting [[emotional_effects_of_longterm_challenges | emotional effects of long-term challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Introducing Challenges and Distractions:**
    *   Small games like rock-paper-scissors (though ill-advised for a contestant) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, a soccer goal to encourage movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, and "Simon Says" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a> were used to try and get people to accidentally step out.
    *   Larger, prize-based challenges like the Tesla ride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a> and the balance beam challenge for $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a> provided temporary excitement and opportunities for smaller wins.
    *   A "mystery wheel" offered either cash prizes or penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, keeping participants engaged and testing their luck. A "magic 8-ball" also offered a chance to leave with money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. A "balloon wall" had various prizes and punishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

## Contestant's Morale and Coping Mechanisms

Contestants demonstrated various [[challenges_and_survival_strategies | survival strategies]] and reactions to the evolving conditions:

*   **Emotional Resilience:** Some contestants, like the woman hoping to use prize money for bills, showed strong emotional determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Akira was noted for his intense determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>, though he eventually left after 10 hours of standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. Others resorted to physical discomfort to stay awake and motivated, like splashing cold water or slapping themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.
*   **Humor and [[team_dynamics_and_humor_in_long_challenges | Team Dynamics]]:** Despite the competition, there was evidence of [[team_dynamics_and_strategies | team dynamics and strategies]] and humor, such as the "grass ball" phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, playing "Simon Says" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, and collective efforts to help one contestant win a Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **Forming Bonds:** A marriage proposal occurred within the circle, showing the formation of deep personal connections despite the challenging environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Adapting to Hardship:** Contestants were seen sleeping on cereal boxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a> and enduring continuous standing for over 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>, highlighting their physical and mental endurance.
*   **Mixed Feelings about Offers:** While some, like William, took the $10,000 offer (especially with the addition of a PlayStation 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>, others regretted not taking early offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a> or refused to leave, showing a strong commitment to the main prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
*   **Partnerships and Duct Taping:** On Day 9, contestants were paired up and duct-taped together, and forbidden from sitting down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. This extreme measure tested their patience and ability to cooperate, with one contestant noting, "I don't really like my partner that much. So it's gonna be kind of hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

By day 12, with only 10 people remaining in very small designated areas, the challenge transformed into a game of tag to determine the ultimate winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>, marking the conclusion of this initial phase of the endurance contest.

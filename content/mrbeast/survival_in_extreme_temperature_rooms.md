Participants in various [[survival_challenges | survival challenges]] face the daunting task of enduring extreme conditions for monetary rewards. One such challenge involves surviving extended periods in rooms designed to be either the "coldest room in the world" or the "hottest room in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## The Cold Room Challenge

A participant named Airrack chose to enter the world's coldest room over the hottest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, despite finding both options "horrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The room provided a bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The rule for this challenge was that for every hour a participant survived in the room, a random person would receive $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Coping Mechanisms and [[Mental and Physical Strain in Extreme Conditions | Strain]]

*   **Sleeping**: Airrack's primary strategy to cope with the extreme cold was to snuggle into an "ice bed" and attempt to sleep through the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. After the first hour, he confirmed he was actually sleeping and believed that one cannot feel cold when asleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Increased Difficulty**: To make the challenge harder, Airrack's hoodie was taken away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. The timer was paused until he surrendered his hoodie, for which he received an additional $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Physical Impact**: Despite his coping mechanism, Airrack stated he was "horribly cold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a> and at one point exclaimed he had "never been this cold" in his entire life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. He reached a point where he felt he had "nothing left" and had to exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

Airrack successfully survived multiple hours, accumulating $80,000 for random people, before deciding to end his time in the cold room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

## The Hot Room

While the coldest room was extensively featured, the "hottest room in the world" was also presented as an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. After enduring the cold room, a proposal was made to move the participant directly to the hottest room, but this was immediately dismissed as dangerous, being described as "psychopath" behavior to transition so rapidly between such temperature extremes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

A quarter-million-dollar Lamborghini was subjected to an extreme test to see if it could be protected from destruction. The challenge involved a 24-hour deadline to construct a defense capable of withstanding various attacks, beginning with 10,000 bullets [00:00:14].

## The Challenge: Surviving 10,000 Bullets

Blake was given a [[lamborghini_protection_challenge | Lamborghini]] and 24 hours to build a fortress to protect it from 10,000 bullets fired by eight soldiers [00:00:14]. The timer started immediately [00:00:25].

### Initial Strategy and Supplies

Blake's initial plan involved a multi-layered defense:
*   A wall of cinder blocks [00:00:26].
*   Shipping containers filled with refrigerators [00:00:30].
*   A wall of cars [00:00:32].

Blake spent $78,000 on supplies [00:00:46], which included a water truck [00:00:58], junk cars [00:01:00], and a CONEX crate (shipping container) [00:01:01].

### Construction of the Bulletproof Fortress

Work began quickly, with a storage container forming the first line of defense [00:01:14]. As time progressed, Blake upgraded his defense, working through the night and into the next morning [00:01:41].

The completed structure for the bullet challenge included:
*   Concrete in the front [00:01:58].
*   The tallest part of the wall positioned in the center to block "crow's nest machine guns" [00:02:00].
*   Cars placed inside storage containers [00:02:05].
*   A "bunch of water" [00:02:07].
*   Railroad ties were incorporated into the defense [00:01:43].
*   One storage container was stuffed with a van and a giant tube [00:01:51].
*   The [[the_safety_and_performance_dynamics_of_ultraexpensive_automobiles | Lamborghini]] was tucked away inside the elaborate setup [00:02:10].

Blake expressed confidence that his build would stop the bullets [00:02:17].

### The Bullet Test Outcome

Eight soldiers fired 10,000 rounds at the fortress [00:02:46]. During the assault, the cinder blocks began to crumble [00:03:04] and the walls showed signs of distress [00:03:12]. Despite the intense barrage, after all 10,000 bullets were fired, the [[the_safety_and_performance_dynamics_of_ultraexpensive_automobiles | Lamborghini]] remained undamaged, with "not one connection" or bullet holes [00:04:15]. Blake successfully bulletproofed the vehicle [00:04:18].

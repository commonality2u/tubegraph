Throughout the duration of the "Last to Take Hand Off Lamborghini Wins" challenge, various [[surprise_giveaways_and_prizes | surprise giveaways]] and [[participant_incentives_and_offers | offers]] were presented to contestants, encouraging eliminations and rewarding perseverance. These ranged from cash prizes for early exits to significant buyouts for those close to winning the grand prize.

## Initial Incentives for Early Exits

Even participants eliminated early in the challenge were offered [[prize_distribution_and_surprise_outcomes | unexpected rewards]].

*   **First Out Reward**
    The first contestant to remove their hand from the Lamborghini, accidentally startled by water, received $1,000 as a [[winning_a_prize_unexpectedly | consolation prize]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Nissan Car Offer**
    After some time, a new Nissan car was offered to the next person who voluntarily removed their hand from the Lamborghini within 10 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. One contestant quickly accepted this offer and drove off in the new car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Strategic Offers and Voluntary Departures

As the challenge progressed, more strategic offers were introduced to thin the crowd, often targeting hunger, sleep, or sudden movements.

*   **Prizes for Accidental Eliminations**
    Throughout the challenge, participants who accidentally removed their hand due to various distractions (e.g., a foot being stepped on, dropping a water bottle) were given a typical prize of $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Sleeping Eliminations**
    Sleeping participants who accidentally removed their hand were found with $1,000 cash notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Footage was used to confirm sleeping eliminations in later stages, with individuals losing out on the Lamborghini for minor movements like scratching an itchy nose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Basketball Shot for $10,000**
    During a promotional announcement for a documentary, a contestant was offered $10,000 if they could make a basketball shot while keeping their hand on the Lamborghini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. One contestant, David, successfully made the shot and won the $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Camaro Offer**
    A brand new Camaro was brought out and offered to the first person to touch it, encouraging multiple contestants to voluntarily remove their hands from the Lamborghini and race for the new car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## Rewards for Reaching the Top 10

Upon reaching the top 10, remaining contestants were rewarded with access to a prize room, ensuring everyone walked away with something significant.

*   **Prize Room Access**
    Contestants who made it to the top 10 were granted access to a "prize room" and encouraged to grab whatever they wanted, including iPhones, iPads, and cash, as a reward for their endurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. This ensured that every person on the Lamborghini would walk away with a prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Final Round Buyout Offers

As the competition narrowed, the value of the [[prize_incentives_and_participant_decisions | incentives]] dramatically increased, aiming to tempt participants away from the final prize.

*   **$10,000 for Trunk Opener**
    One contestant who accidentally opened the Lamborghini's trunk and removed their hand was given $10,000 cash for making it that far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Guaranteed Spot in Next Challenge + $10,000**
    A contestant named Akira, feeling at his breaking point, was offered $10,000 cash and a guaranteed spot in the next challenge if he removed his hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. He accepted this [[impact_of_surprise_rewards_and_twist_in_game_shows | unique giveaway]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
*   **Voluntary Exits for Cash and Electronics**
    In the final stages, explicit buyout offers were made to remaining contestants.
    *   One contestant accepted an offer of $20,000 cash and a brand new MacBook for leaving the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.
    *   Another contestant negotiated for $25,000 to cover student loans and new phones for herself and her roommate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
*   **Second Place Prize**
    The runner-up, who lasted until only one other person remained, received $40,000 in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. This [[prize_distribution_and_winners_intentions | significant sum]] was presented as a high-value consolation for narrowly missing the main prize.

In an electrifying episode of giveaways and challenges, MrBeast once again delighted his audience by presenting some extravagant grand prize opportunities to his subscribers. This recent video showcased two notably significant prizes: the choice between [[lamborghini_vs_house_decision | a Lamborghini and a house]], and the ever-enticing promise of a [[winning_a_million_dollars_challenge | million-dollar reward]]. Below, we delve into the details of these major giveaways.

## Lamborghini vs. House: A Life-Changing Decision

At the start of the video, MrBeast introduced a grand dilemma for one lucky subscriber - choosing between a [[contest_challenge_to_win_a_lamborghini | Lamborghini and a house]]. With the stakes incredibly high, the participant had no prior knowledge of what either option entailed. The suspense was palpable as MrBeast explained the features of the house—a three-bedroom, two-bathroom residence with a kitchen—without revealing the true market value of either choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

Opting for the house, the contestant was initially unaware if he had made the wiser choice. However, MrBeast revealed that the house was $90,000 more expensive than the Lamborghini, confirming that the participant had indeed made the right decision, as noted by MrBeast himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## The Million-Dollar Challenge: Mastering Cornhole

Further into the video, MrBeast set up a tantalizing challenge involving a [[creative_games_to_win_prizes_and_money | game of cornhole with a twist]]. Participants had the chance to win varying amounts based on which hole they made their toss into, but the real allure was the possibility of walking away with $1 million.

The setup included a series of increasingly difficult throws, culminating in a seemingly impossible shot for a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. The draw was undeniable, though ultimately no participant in this episode managed to secure the [[challenge_with_a_monetary_reward | top cash prize]].

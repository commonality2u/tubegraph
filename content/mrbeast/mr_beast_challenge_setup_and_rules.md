The "Boys vs. Girls" challenge conceived by [[mrbeasts_unique_video_concepts | MrBeast]] involved two teams, one of 100 boys and one of 100 girls, placed within two separate, large circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The objective of this [[youtuber_competition_challenges | competition]] was for one team to maintain more participants inside their designated circle than the other team after 100 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The winning team would collectively share a grand prize of $500,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Challenge Format and Rules

### Initial Setup and Goal
The challenge began with 100 boys in one circle and 100 girls in another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The core premise was a team competition where the boys competed against the girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The team that had more people remaining after 100 hours would win the half-a-million-dollar prize, which would be split amongst all members of the winning team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. A crucial rule for the prize distribution was that even if a participant voluntarily left the circle, they would still receive their share of the $5,000 prize money if their team won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. [[mr_beast_and_friends_pizza_challenge | MrBeast]] intentionally withheld details about the challenge duration and specifics from the participants until the start to encourage natural attrition due to outside commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Elimination Rules
The primary rule for elimination was simple: if a participant touched the red line marking the boundary of their circle, they were immediately eliminated from the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

### Monitoring and Oversight
To ensure fair play and strict adherence to the rules, the challenge area was equipped with over 65 cameras covering every square inch of both circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. A dedicated team of people continuously monitored everyone's movements to detect any rule infringements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. GoPros were also strategically placed on the red lines to catch even the slightest touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Challenge Phases and Special Rules
Throughout the 100 hours, [[mrbeast_challenges | MrBeast]] introduced various elements and mini-challenges to test the participants' endurance, teamwork, and resolve.

*   **Amenities**: Porta potties were provided to both circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Food**: Participants were initially given unappetizing oatmeal for dinner to test their determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. After 24 hours, Hibachi chefs were brought in to cook a more desirable meal for the girls, creating a psychological challenge for the boys who could hear the feasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. On night four, participants were allowed to cook their own meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.
*   **Distractions and Temptations**:
    *   **Overnight Annoyances**: [[mr_beasts_role_and_interactions | Karl]] and [[mr_beasts_role_and_interactions | Nolan]] would annoy contestants with loud sirens while they slept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
    *   **Real-Life Accommodation**: [[mr_beasts_role_and_interactions | Nolan]] arranged for a participant to attend an important scholarship Zoom call from inside the circle, complete with a suit and laptop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
    *   **Hidden Car Keys**: After 43 hours, a [[bounty_hunting_challenges_and_strategies | hidden]] car key was placed in a porta potty in each circle. The first person to find the key won a brand new car and an additional $5,000 for gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
    *   **Rubik's Cube Race**: At the 50-hour mark, teams competed in a race to solve 100 Rubik's cubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. The losing team's circle would be cut in half, reducing their usable space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. During this [[competition_dynamics_in_scavenger_challenges | competition]], [[mr_beasts_role_and_interactions | MrBeast]] offered the boys' expert solver $10,000 to leave, which he accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
    *   **Empty Briefcases**: Empty briefcases were left outside the circles to tempt participants to step out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. This tactic was repeated with briefcases containing only cereal or nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
    *   **Mystery Button**: A podium with a giant red button was placed in each circle without explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. Pressing it would result in the team's circle being cut in half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.
    *   **Spying**: A drone was borrowed by a girl to spy on the boys' circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   **Final Hours**: For the last 10 hours, each circle was divided into 10 sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. Every hour, the teams had to decide which section to block off, further reducing their space and forcing closer proximity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

### Outcome
After 100 hours, the challenge concluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. Out of the initial 100 boys, 33 remained, while 35 girls out of their initial 100 were still in their circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. The girls' team, having two more members, officially won the half-a-million-dollar prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

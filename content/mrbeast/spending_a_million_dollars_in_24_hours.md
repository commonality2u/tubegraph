From: [[mrbeast]] <br/> 

Mark, the winner of the "<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">last to take hand off 1 million keeps it</a>" [[survival_challenge_for_money | challenge]], was given 24 hours to spend his $1 million prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The initial plan was to use the money responsibly to secure Mark's future through smart purchases like a house, cars, and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Initial Shopping Spree

The spending began with a [[shopping_sprees_for_individuals_in_need | shopping spree]] at a store, where Mark purchased numerous electronics, many for his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This first batch of purchases included:
*   Three PS4s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>
*   Two Nintendo Switches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
*   Three MacBooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
*   Seven iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>
*   Two Note 10 Plus's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>
*   New iPads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>

The total cost for these items was $23,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, which was noted as a small percentage of the total prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Major Purchases: Cars and a Home

### Vehicles
Mark proceeded to a car dealership, where he selected two cars for approximately $100,000 in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. One of these was a new black GMC for his wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This marked a significant upgrade from his previous vehicle, a 2001 Toyota Camry he bought for $600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

### New Residence
Prior to winning, Mark lived in a cramped space, sharing a house with another family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. His small room with his wife lacked space, and his cousin slept on a flat air mattress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

Mark purchased a new house for $165,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. The new residence was significantly larger, offering plenty of room compared to his previous living situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. He expressed deep gratitude, highlighting how this change would allow him to provide for his family after having only $5 in his bank account a week prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

Following the house purchase, Mark allocated $30,000 for furniture and another $30,000 for new appliances, including a "talking refrigerator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

## Generosity and Gifts

Mark showed significant generosity with his winnings:
*   He bought three MacBooks, giving them to his wife, cousin, and sister's friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   He purchased a $20,000 wedding ring for his wife, replacing her previous "cheap" one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   He distributed gifts to his family, including PlayStations, VR headsets, MacBooks, Apple Watches, iPads, and a headset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   He planned to give his mother $15,000 and his mother-in-law $15,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   He promised $50,000 to Jeremy, a previous contestant from the "last to stop biking video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   Mark bought matching Galaxy Watches with the host <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

## Coach's Share and Other Expenses

As per a predetermined rule, Chandler, Mark's coach in the Million Dollar Challenge, received 10% of the winnings, totaling $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Chandler spent $16,000 at Best Buy and $44,000 on bills, totaling $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

Additional costs included $15,000 for the house's closing costs and $20,000 for utilities and other unforeseen expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

## Financial Planning: Taxes and Investments

A significant portion of the winnings was allocated for future financial stability. Mark set aside $340,000 (40%) to cover his tax liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. He also planned to invest $50,000 and keep an additional $23,000 for other nuances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

Mark met with a financial expert to discuss [[financial_planning_and_investing_after_winning_a_large_sum | investment strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.

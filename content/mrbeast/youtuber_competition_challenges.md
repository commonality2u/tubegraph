A massive [[mrbeast_challenges | MrBeast]] event gathered 50 of the biggest YouTubers to compete in a series of [[unique_competition_formats | unique competition formats]] within a confined cube for a $1 million prize for their subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This event was described as an unprecedented "1 billion subscribers worth of YouTubers" competing for the prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, marking it as one of the most brutal and cutthroat pieces of content featuring these creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The core rule throughout the competition was that stepping on a red line inside the cube resulted in elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

The competition explored various [[contestant_competition_strategies | contestant competition strategies]], from conserving energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> to outright elimination of others for subscriber benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The atmosphere began with camaraderie, but quickly evolved into intense [[youtuber_competition_dynamics | competition dynamics]] as the stakes rose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Challenges Overview

### Challenge 1: Free Throw for a Cybertruck
The first challenge allowed contestants to temporarily leave the cube to attempt a free throw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Making the shot would win a Cybertruck for a subscriber and allow re-entry into the main challenge, while missing resulted in elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Risk vs. Reward**: Many found the challenge too risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, but some, like Mark Rober <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a> and Jidion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, attempted it and were eliminated.
*   **Successes**: Jesser and FazeRug successfully made their shots, winning Cybertrucks for their fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: After three major YouTubers lost, the challenge was abandoned as no one else wanted to try <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### Accidental Elimination
One YouTuber was eliminated for unintentionally touching the red line while attempting a [[creative_stunts_and_highrisk_video_challenges | creative stunt]] or simply out of boredom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Challenge 2: Cookie Carving
This challenge involved contestants splitting into groups of five, with each group electing a team captain who gained immunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The captains then assigned four cookie shapes (circle, triangle, star, umbrella) to their team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Breaking the cookie during carving resulted in elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **Cookie Difficulty**: The umbrella was noted as the hardest shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, claiming several eliminations, including Pokimane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   **Betrayal**: One team captain assigned the most difficult cookie to a teammate, leading to elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   **Eliminations**: 11 people were eliminated in this round, leaving 34 remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

### Challenge 3: Jenga
Contestants paired up and had their hands duct-taped together before being released to play giant Jenga against their partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
*   **Giant Jenga Issues**: The tower became too tall for players to reach, necessitating a pivot to normal-sized Jenga games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   **Strategic Eliminations**: In one notable instance, a player who lost the Jenga game physically carried his partner out of the cube, resulting in a public vote to determine if this "savage" action was fair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. The group deemed it unfair, leading to the return of the carried-out player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
*   **Self-Sacrifice**: Some contestants intentionally lost or otherwise sacrificed themselves for their friends or allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: The Jenga rounds significantly thinned the competition, leading to 24 hours of competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.

### Interlude: Speed's Arrival and Audience Vote
After 24 hours, popular YouTuber IShowSpeed arrived late to the competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. The remaining contestants were given the option to vote him into the competition or send him home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. Despite arguments for inclusion, the group overwhelmingly voted for him to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.

### Challenge 4: Steal or No Steal (Deal or No Deal)
This challenge featured Howie Mandel as a guest host, adapting the game "Deal or No Deal" into "Steal or No Steal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.
*   **Mechanics**: The contestant with the most subscribers chose a briefcase and a competitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. The first player looked inside their briefcase (either "eliminated" or "safe") and the second player decided whether to "steal" it or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. If stolen, the first player continued playing with another competitor until their case was not stolen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.
*   **Bluffing and Technology**: Players engaged in bluffing, and their heart rates were monitored in real-time using Samsung Galaxy rings and a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6, adding an element of psychological strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.
*   **Outcomes**: This round was marked by intense deception and multiple eliminations, with players needing to read their opponents' reactions and heart rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>. Ultimately, 10 contestants remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.

### Challenge 5: Team Cooking Challenge
The 10 remaining contestants paired up for a team cooking challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>. They were blindfolded while a kitchen set was built around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>.
*   **Judges**: The dishes were judged by Joey Chestnut (renowned competitive eater), Miranda Cosgrove (actress), and IShowSpeed (making a return appearance after being voted out) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.
*   **Criteria**: Meals were rated on taste, creativity, and presentation on a scale of one to ten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. The three teams with the highest scores moved on, and the two lowest were eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>.
*   **Dishes**: Teams prepared diverse meals, including French Cordon Bleu, American comfort food (mac and cheese, chocolate cake), spaghetti tacos, Ronaldo pasta, and Spanish tortilla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>.
*   **Accidental Elimination**: One contestant, while celebrating their team's high score, accidentally stepped on the red line and was eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: Five contestants remained after this round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>.

### Final Challenge: Bluffing with Briefcases
The final five contestants competed in a high-stakes bluffing game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.
*   **Mechanics**: Five briefcases were shuffled while players were blindfolded; four contained nothing, and one held the $1 million check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>. Players then voted to eliminate one person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>. If the voted player's case was empty, they were eliminated. If the voted player had the money, they instantly won the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: This round heavily relied on reading opponents, bluffing, and assessing poker faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>.
*   **Winner**: Jaiden Animations won the final challenge, securing the $1 million prize for her subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>. She expressed her intention to use the prize money to send aspiring artists to art school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>. In addition to the money, the winner also received all the YouTube play buttons of every competitor in the tournament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49">[00:33:49]</a>.

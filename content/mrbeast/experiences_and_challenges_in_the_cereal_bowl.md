A unique [[challenges_and_social_experiments | challenge]] involved contestants sitting in the [[building_the_worlds_largest_cereal_bowl | world's largest cereal bowl]], a 2000-gallon container filled with powdered milk and expired cereal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The objective was a "last to leave" competition, with the winning contestant receiving $10,000 and their team partner receiving $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Initial Reactions and Environment
The cereal mixture smelled like milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Before the challenge began, one of the hosts tested the mixture, describing it as "disgusting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Contestants were told their partners were "in charge of helping" them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Additional cereal was periodically added to the bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, leading to a lot of dust in the air, which contestants could taste when breathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. The cereal quickly became soggy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

## Physical Challenges and Discomfort
Participants quickly experienced physical discomforts:
*   **Smell and Appearance** One contestant described the mixture as "pool of pee, sugar-dried milk," and "disgusting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. The wall of the bowl was also deemed "disgusting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **Urination** Frequent urination was a major issue. One contestant, Ty, reported peeing three times within the first hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, and later five times within two hours, stating he was "currently still peeing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Others also reported frequent urination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Cold** As the challenge progressed, cold became a significant factor. After approximately 14 hours, the temperature was expected to drop to 58 degrees, making it "real cold, real fast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. One contestant, Becca, stated she was "really cold and tired" and suffering from "hypothermia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Connor also cited being "too cold" as his reason for exiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.
*   **Fatigue** Becca expressed that her "morale's so low" and she was "so tired" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## Support and Competition
The partners were responsible for providing support to their contestants, including food, water, and comfort items. Some partners were more supportive than others, leading to a sense of [[competitive_environment_and_pressure_in_challenges | competition]] among the support teams.

*   **Chandler (Ty's Partner)** Chandler provided Ty with water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a> and Chick-fil-A nuggets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. However, he was criticized for not being a "good coach" and for not bringing Ty more food after checking on him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. Ty also noted that Chandler had left him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
*   **Chris (Connor's Partner)** Chris got Connor sushi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a> and an inflatable neck pillow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. He was also seen doing exercises with the contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Jake (Scotch's Partner)** Jake provided Scotch with items from Walmart, including bananas, a book, Gatorade, Powerade, and a floaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   **Host (Becca's Partner)** The host went "all out" for Becca, getting her granola bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, muffins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, more cereal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, many towels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, floaties, a pool noodle, a puppy poster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, an inflatable unicorn, Rice Krispie Treats, Capri Suns, M&Ms, Honey Buns, and Spinwheels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. He also bought her a very large glass of orange juice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

## Contestant Morale and Exits
The challenge tested the endurance and mental fortitude of the contestants.

*   **Becca** Becca lasted six hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a> before deciding to leave due to being "really cold and tired" and finding the smell "really bad" and "gross" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. She felt her competitors were "a lot stronger" than her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Ty** Ty maintained a strong morale initially, claiming he could last "another six days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. He eventually left after seven hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>, primarily due to being asleep and missing opportunities for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. He stated he "can't hang" because the situation was "so heavy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.
*   **Connor** Connor aimed to win enough money to go to Disney World <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. He was the last remaining contestant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>, lasting 14 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. He eventually gave up due to the cold, stating, "It's too cold now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

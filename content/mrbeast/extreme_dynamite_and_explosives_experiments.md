This article details various experiments involving large-scale use of explosives, including dynamite and fireworks. These stunts are designed to showcase destructive power and test the limits of protection and survival.

## House Full of Fireworks

One experiment involved filling a house with over 100,000 fireworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The objective was to see if it was possible for dummies, hidden by participants, to survive the resulting explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Dummies were placed in locations such as a bathtub, a fridge, under a washer, and on the front porch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

After ignition, the house exploded and continued to burn throughout the night, leaving literally nothing left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. All the mannequins were destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> This experiment was conducted by professionals and included a strict warning: "Please do not try this in your house" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Protecting Money from TNT

An elaborate [[explosive_resistance_tests | explosive resistance test]] involved protecting $50,000 from thousands of pounds of TNT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Will was tasked with building a fortress using any materials he desired, with the promise that he could keep any money that survived the explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Construction of the Fortress

Will initially purchased 12 industrial water containers, filling them with 20,000 pounds of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. He later expanded his efforts by hiring professionals to construct the fortress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

The challenge was increased when the host offered to double the TNT if Will allowed them to double the money to $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Will accepted the deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

The final [[building_a_fortress_to_protect_money_from_tnt | seven-layer fortress]] included:
*   20,000 pounds of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>
*   Mattresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>
*   A cinder block wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>
*   Four more mattresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>
*   A second cinder block wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>
*   An additional 32,000 pounds of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>
*   A final wall of dirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>

Will also added a secret layer of Feastables bars inside the fortress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### The Explosion

With the TNT doubled, the bunker was put to the test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. The explosion created an immense smoke cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. After the dust settled, over $95,000 of the money survived the explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>, allowing Will to keep the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## Other Explosive Events

The video concludes with a general explosion to end the segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

A competition designed to simulate academic progression through school grades tested contestants' knowledge in various subjects, assessing the [[Impact of surprises and moral lessons in competitions | effectiveness]] of a high-stakes, rapid-fire educational format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Competition Structure

Contestants started at the first-grade level and advanced through each subsequent grade up to twelfth grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Each grade involved a ten-question test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

### Rules and Penalties
Contestants were required to pass each test by missing no more than two questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Failure to meet this standard resulted in being "pelted by water balloons" and not proceeding to the next grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This [[use_of_fear_as_motivation_in_competitions | fear-based motivation]] was a core element of the challenge.

### Reward System
The competition offered two potential paths to a $10,000 prize:
1.  The last person remaining who had not failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
2.  If all contestants successfully reached 12th grade, they would collectively receive the prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This setup introduced a [[competition_dynamics_and_teamwork | teamwork]] element, encouraging mutual success.

## Academic Rigor and Contestant Performance

*   **First Grade:** Reading and Math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Second Grade:** Math (e.g., subtraction with borrowing) and general knowledge (e.g., states of matter, past tense verbs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Study and Test-Taking Strategies
The [[Contestant competition strategies | contestants]] did not appear to engage in traditional "study" before tests; instead, they relied on immediate recall from brief "lessons" or prior knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Some strategies observed included:
*   **Cheating:** Mr. Beast initially tried to use a calculator in first grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Overconfidence:** Chandler's overconfidence in second grade led to his failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Attempting to fail:** Chandler claimed he missed questions "on purpose" to be funny, though this was contradicted by Mr. Beast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **Note-taking and external aids:** Notes and calculators were strictly prohibited during tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Collaborative grading:** Contestants graded each other's papers, which introduced an element of honesty and peer pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Outcomes and Reflections

### Failures and Eliminations
Several contestants were eliminated throughout the competition:
*   **Chandler:** Failed second grade, missing three questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. His elimination was met with a dramatic water balloon barrage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Ethan:** Failed fifth grade, getting only 10% on the test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. He found the water balloons painful, leaving welts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Garrett:** Also failed fifth grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. He found comfort in the water reminding him of his dad's yacht <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Jimmy:** Failed seventh grade due to spelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. He noted that some balloons did not break on impact and felt like a baseball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **Chris:** Failed eleventh grade, missing four questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

### Success and the Winner
Bailey was the sole contestant to reach and pass twelfth grade, securing the $10,000 prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. He expressed pride in his achievement, stating he only expected to reach third grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. He planned to use the prize money to pay off real school debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

> [!Summary] [[Emotional dynamics in competitions | Emotional Aspects of Competition]]
> Contestants displayed a range of emotions including confidence, frustration, disappointment, and pride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. The physical penalty of water balloons added to the [[Emotional aspects of competition | emotional intensity]] and consequences of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. While some struggled with specific subjects like spelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>, others found the experience easier than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

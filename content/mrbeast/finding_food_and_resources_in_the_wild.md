Two strangers, Hase and Grizz, were dropped into the wilderness and challenged to [[survival_in_the_wilderness | survive in the wilderness]] for an indefinite period, earning $10,000 for each day they endured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This challenge highlights the critical aspects of [[resource_management_in_survival_situations | resource management]] and [[outdoor_survival_skills | outdoor survival skills]], including finding and utilizing available food, water, and materials for shelter.

## Initial Supplies and Setup

Upon their arrival, the duo assessed their limited initial supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>:
*   Approximately five days worth of food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   Two containers of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>
*   A change of clothes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>
*   Warm jackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>
*   A fire starter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>

Their immediate priorities were to establish a camp, build a fire, and ensure their survival through the first night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. They successfully started a fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> and made rudimentary beds from pine needles to avoid freezing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Shelter Construction and Upgrades

After a few days, the discomfort of sleeping on the ground prompted them to focus on [[building_shelters_and_finding_resources | building shelters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Their construction involved:
*   Gathering pine needles with a jacket to layer on the shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   Utilizing a metal piece from a child's swing set for a roof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   Incorporating structural poles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   Using parachutes and their cords to create a rain cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

Later, they decided to move their camp closer to a new water source and upgraded their shelter using dead trees for the structure, forming an A-frame shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. They also constructed a fishing dock to aid in [[the_importance_of_water_and_food_in_survival | food]] acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. By day 28, they built a raised bed system within their shelter, using tripods, side rails, slats, and a pine needle mattress made from parachutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. They even repurposed a large board and money cases into a sturdy table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

## Water Sourcing

The initial water supply was limited. On day four, they began searching for a water source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. They found a swamp and intended to boil the water to make it safe for consumption, acknowledging the risk of bacteria and parasites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. They later discovered a flowing creek, which was a much better source of moving water, likely containing fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

## Food Scarcity and Foraging

The five days of food provided ran out quickly, leading to significant hunger by day nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. They resorted to foraging, eating Greenbrier leaves which Grizz identified as edible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Their food situation was so dire that they described it as a "fast" instead of starving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

On day 10, they were offered an additional ten days worth of food, spices, two tarps, and fishing supplies for $50,000 of their prize money, which they accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## Fishing and Wildlife Encounters

Despite having fishing supplies, their initial attempts at the swamp were unsuccessful as it contained no fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Finding the creek with moving water was crucial for their [[the_importance_of_water_and_food_in_survival | food]] supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

After days of failing to catch fish with bait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, they finally caught an eel on day 27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This was their first successful catch in 27 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Later, Hase created a makeshift fishing pole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>, but it broke, forcing him to catch fish by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. He eventually succeeded in catching a sea trout, providing a fresh meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

As spring arrived, new challenges emerged, including [[dealing_with_wildlife_and_the_environment | wildlife]] like snakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a> and rats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>, which further complicated their [[survival_in_the_wilderness | survival]] efforts.

## Improvisation and Resourcefulness

The contestants demonstrated significant [[improvisation_and_resourcefulness_in_survival_situations | improvisation and resourcefulness]]:
*   They used pine needles for beds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   They repurposed a metal piece from a swing set for their shelter roof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   Parachutes from daily money drops were reused for rain covers and bed mattresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   Hase built a functional boat using sticks and a tarp to navigate the swamp and reach fishing rivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. This boat, though crude, was successful in its first sea trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.
*   They transformed a large board and money cases into a table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

## External Offers for Resources

The host frequently offered the duo various resources for money.
*   On Day 20, they were offered one sleeping bag for $10,000 or two for $50,000, despite knowing cold temperatures were coming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. They declined, believing they could adapt with their current bedding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   After surviving a month, they were presented with a "store" offering items like firewood, a shovel, cooking supplies, bedding, books, and board games, with each item costing $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. They refused to buy anything, citing their ability to improvise with parachutes and other available materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Hase indicated he would only buy firewood if it came with an unlimited supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   On Day 50, after they built their own boat, the host offered them a ready-made boat with a Zaxby's restaurant for $50,000, discounted to $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. They again declined, trusting Hase's handmade vessel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

Despite these offers, they largely relied on their wits and the natural environment, enduring challenges like lack of sleep due to cold and wildlife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Their commitment to [[survival_in_the_wilderness | survival]] without unnecessary spending showcased their extreme [[improvisation_and_resourcefulness_in_survival_situations | resourcefulness]] and strategic money management.

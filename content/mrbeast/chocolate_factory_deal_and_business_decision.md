The culmination of the challenge, which involved a recreation of [[willy_wonkas_chocolate_factory_recreation | Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory]] in real life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, was the prize of owning the factory itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Contestants earned their spot by finding golden tickets in Feastables Bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, making the entire event a form of [[promotional_marketing_for_Feastables | promotional marketing for Feastables]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## The Prize: A Real-Life Chocolate Factory

The "chocolate factory" included various themed areas such as a "Candy Land" entrance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, a chocolate door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, a chocolate river with a chocolate waterfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, and a marshmallow room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The winner of the final cooking challenge received the deed to this factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

## The Business Decision: Selling the Factory

Immediately after the factory was awarded, a significant business proposition was made to the winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

### Challenges of Ownership
The host highlighted several practical drawbacks of owning the chocolate factory:
*   The chocolate river was deteriorating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.
*   All the candy inside was going bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.
*   There were likely a million flies in the factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.
*   The upkeep costs would be substantial, potentially over a hundred thousand dollars a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

### The Offer
Given these challenges, the host offered to buy back the chocolate factory from the winner for half a million dollars in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. The cash, totaling half a million dollars, was presented to the winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

### The Outcome
The winner, upon seeing the substantial amount of cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>, agreed to sell the factory for the offered half a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. The deed to the factory was officially handed over in exchange for the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. This decision transformed the prize from a high-maintenance asset into immediate, significant financial gain for the contestant.

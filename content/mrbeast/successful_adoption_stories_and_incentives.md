A campaign was launched with the goal of ensuring every dog in a particular dog shelter found a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This initiative involved a significant marketing effort and provided various [[participant_incentives_and_offers | incentives]] to new adopters.

## Marketing Campaign for Adoption
To attract potential adopters, the campaign employed several strategies:
*   **Billboard Advertising** A billboard was purchased to increase traffic to the shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Initially, the effectiveness of the billboard surprised the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Later, 50 additional billboards were acquired to further boost visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Flyers** Flyers were made and distributed around town <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Box Truck** A box truck was used, similar to a previous campaign for PewDiePie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Professional Photography** Professional photos were taken of all the dogs to be used in marketing materials, starting with Winston <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. These photos were then edited for the billboards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Radio Interview** A radio station interview was conducted by Ethan to promote the shelter, emphasizing that people should adopt based on desire for a dog, not because of the "Beast Crew" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Costumed Mascot** An individual wore a dog costume and held a "Cute Doggos Inside" sign outside the shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## Successful Adoption Stories

Many dogs found homes through the campaign, often with additional [[prize_incentives_and_participant_decisions | incentives]] provided to their new families.

## Outcome and Continued Support
By the end of the campaign, every dog in the shelter was adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. The success of the campaign was largely attributed to the comprehensive [[impact_of_marketing_campaigns_for_pet_adoption | marketing campaigns for pet adoption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

The company collaborated with Furkids, a no-kill shelter, which still has many other dogs in need of homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. Donations to Furkids are encouraged to help them build bigger facilities and assist thousands more dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

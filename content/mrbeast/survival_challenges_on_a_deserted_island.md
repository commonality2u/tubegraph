A group of individuals faced the [[challenges_of_surviving_on_a_deserted_island | challenges of surviving on a deserted island]] for seven days in the middle of the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The island had not sustained civilization for over 250 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Day One: Establishing Camp

Upon arrival, with only about four hours until nightfall, the immediate priority was to build a shelter due to the heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
The initial camp setup involved:
*   **Building a Shelter** The team began by looking for wood to construct the frame for a shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Setting up a Fire Pit** Nolan and Mack worked on creating a fire pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Identifying Dangers** A significant threat on the island was identified as the manchineel tree, known as "the most dangerous tree on earth," which contains poisonous sap that can be lethal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

During the day, wildlife such as chickens were encountered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. There was an attempt to catch a chicken for food, but it was prevented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

The group had a survival crate containing food, water, and a flare for emergencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. By nightfall, camp was prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. One participant experienced sunburn by the end of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, and there was concern about potential rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The first night's sleep was restless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Day Two: Improvements and Challenges

The primary objective for Day Two was to construct a larger, rainproof shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, create more comfortable seating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, and improve the fire pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Long, sturdy sticks were sought to create a roof that would allow rain to flow off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

An ocean buoy was discovered and repurposed as a "bouncy seat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The team also gathered coconuts for consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

A significant challenge emerged regarding water consumption; the group had depleted 40% of their water supply (from ten to six carts) by the end of day two, prompting a need for more responsible usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

The second night was worse than the first due to an infestation of bugs on the island, resulting in numerous bites and poor sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## Day Three: Resource Acquisition and Exploration

While others were catching up on sleep due to bug bites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, some group members decided to build a chicken trap using a found net <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. After three hours of waiting, a chicken was successfully caught, named "Bryan," and then freed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

Later, as the heat subsided, an "adventure" to a nearby rock in the ocean was undertaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. During the swim, fish and a stingray were observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. The waves were large, and the rocks on the smaller island were slippery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

Raindrops were felt just before sunset, and a storm was seen approaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. The group quickly prepped by gathering more palm leaves for the shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Fortunately, the storm narrowly missed them that night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

## Day Four: Fishing and Morale Boost

The group's morning routine involved complaining about poor sleep, using the bathroom, and eating bagged meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. To alleviate the monotony of bagged meals, a plan was devised to catch fish from the deeper ocean waters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. One member acted as a "human motorboat" to tow others out, using a 500-foot rope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

Despite a rope snapping and a storm appearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, after two hours, they managed to catch only one fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. The fish was surprisingly good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

To further boost morale, the group then made s'mores using a chocolate bar from a sponsor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. As has become a pattern, it started raining again as they went to bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

## Day Five: Ruins Exploration and The Storm

The team decided to explore the island's old houses or ruins located on top of a mountain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. Before departing, a goat appeared on the shoreline, which one member wanted to eat, but it was scared away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

During the strenuous climb up the mountain, a rainbow was spotted, but it was also identified as a sign of approaching rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. At the ruins, a large yellow crate was found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>, which surprisingly contained a "third chance" for a participant who had previously lost money in videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. The ruins themselves were centuries old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

The view from the mountain peak was considered worth the difficult journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. However, the return trip down the mountain at night was challenging due to darkness and the terrain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. They encountered a cactus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a> and hit a dead end, getting lost in the forest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

Adding to the [[challenges_of_extreme_survival_scenarios | challenges of extreme survival scenarios]], it started raining while they were lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. They also had to be wary of the poisonous manchineel tree sap, which becomes a burn risk when it rains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

After eventually finding their way back to camp, they ate dinner and showered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. Unexpectedly, a heavy rainstorm hit, causing water to pool on their shelter roof and making them fear it might collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. They were unable to sleep due to the continuous rain, damaged shelter, and soaking wet beds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

## Day Six: Mental and Physical Strain

The rain from the previous night was "brutal," leaving the group cold and tired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. After six days of physical struggle, their mental health also began to suffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>. They experienced headaches and extreme tiredness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. The continuous consumption of bagged food also contributed to their feeling "terrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.

To combat the low morale and turn things around, they treated themselves to canned cobbler for breakfast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. They realized that having fun with each other was key to surviving Day Six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. Despite the suffering, the trip was filled with "a lot of fun and adventure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.

The final night on the island was celebrated with a massive fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.

## Day Seven: Departure

As the sun rose on Day Seven, the group broke down camp and cleaned up, eagerly anticipating their departure and never returning to the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>.

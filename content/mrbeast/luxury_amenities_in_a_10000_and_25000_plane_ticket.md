### Limitations

- **Bathroom Amenities:** Despite the luxurious setting, the bathroom is considered a disappointment due to [[features_of_a_luxury_doomsday_bunker | its lack of features]] like a shower or heated floors.

- **Comfortable Sleeping Arrangement:** The highlight of this fare is the inclusion of a [[features_of_a_billion_dollar_yacht | queen-size bed]], turning a long flight into a restful experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

> The $25,000 ticket significantly amplifies the sense of opulence, yet some amenities are considered more practical in the $10,000 fare, such as the bathroom facilities.

In conclusion, whether the $10,000 or $25,000 ticket suits one's expectations often depends on personal preferences and priorities for amenities. Both options deliver luxury, but each has its own distinctive set of offerings.

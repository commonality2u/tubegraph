Individuals facing [[challenges_of_extreme_survival_scenarios | dangerous survival scenarios]] or perceived high-risk environments may be prompted to create a will to specify the distribution of their assets and care of dependents in the event of their death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This act provides a formal record of their wishes, even when immediate threats are present.

## Context of Creation

In an expedition to the Bermuda Triangle, described as "one of the most dangerous places on earth" where "over 100 ships and planes have gone missing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, participants were instructed to make a will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The purpose was to determine what they would want to happen with their money and possessions "if something were to happen" to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Process and Contents

For the purpose of formality, participants were provided with quills and paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> to write their "last will and testament" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

Examples of specified bequests include:
*   Leaving a dog and "everything else" to family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   Declaring an ostrich "a free man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   Designating a spouse to receive a house, cars, dogs, cats, and all money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   Instructing a mother to take a car and an Xbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Experiment Overview
An individual undertook an experiment to spend seven days in solitary confinement within a soundproof, white room with zero human contact and zero stimulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This environment was considered [[psychological_effects_of_isolation | psychologically dangerous]] by a doctor, who noted it was "much worse than anything" they had seen in 23 years of working in psych hospitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Anything beyond 50 hours in such a room can lead to permanent [[psychological_effects_of_isolation | psychological damage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, with the experiment lasting 168 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The doctor highlighted that without information coming into the brain, it "generates craziness," including hallucinations and paranoia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Psychological and Emotional Impact
The experiment presented significant [[the_psychological_and_emotional_challenges_of_isolation | psychological and emotional challenges]].
*   **Risk of Psychosis:** There was a significant chance of losing one's mind and entering a state of psychosis, which could cause permanent damage, necessitating early extraction from the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Dehumanizing Experience:** The experience was described as "very dehumanizing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The individual felt like they had "lost all [their] rights as a human" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a> and reached "literal rock bottom" mentally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>, considering the conditions "very inhumane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   **Boredom and Agitation:** Extreme boredom quickly set in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, leading to agitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The subject stated, "This is getting very hard on me mentally. I'm bored. Help" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   **Depression and Misery:** Feelings of depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a> and misery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a> became prevalent. The individual noted that the happiness from receiving a meal was fleeting, quickly replaced by a "wave of depression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   **Loneliness and FOMO:** Intense loneliness was experienced, leading to the subject missing their girlfriend and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. There was also a "severe FOMO" (fear of missing out) on events in the outside world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Paranoia:** The doctor noted that paranoia developed as time went on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, leading the subject to question constant surveillance by cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
*   **Dreams and Reality:** Dreams began to involve being in the white room, blurring the lines between sleep and reality and adding to the feeling of being trapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
*   **Behavioral Changes:** The subject resorted to crying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>, napping on the floor, throwing things, and having tantrums, exhibiting behavior likened to that of a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

### Cognitive Disorientation
The lack of stimulation severely impacted cognitive functions.
*   **Loss of Time Perception:** The participant consistently lost their sense of time, being off by hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a> and even a full day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The constant bright lights were noted to be "really messing with my brain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Mental Deterioration:** The subject felt their mind was "slowly deforming into stupidity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a> and even forgot simple words like "roll" for bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **Hallucinations/Paranoia:** The doctor explained that the brain, deprived of information, "generates craziness," including hallucinations and paranoia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Physical Effects
The environment also manifested physical challenges.
*   **Insomnia:** The participant struggled with severe insomnia, unable to sleep due to the bright lights and the psychological urge to "sleep this off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Headaches:** Prolonged exposure to bright lights led to "ginormous headache[s]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Lightheadedness:** Upon exiting the room, the participant felt "kind of lightheaded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.
*   **Appetite Distortion:** Despite receiving adequate calories, the participant constantly felt starving due to understimulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

## Coping Mechanisms and Deterioration
As the experiment progressed, the participant attempted various strategies to cope with the [[solitary_confinement_challenges | challenges of isolation]] and lack of stimulation.
*   **Counting:** Early on, this involved counting the tiles on the walls (1900 on walls, 2860 including roof and floor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, counting to 1000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, or counting individual grains of rice (447 grains on one tray) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Sensory Engagement:** Simple objects like a metal plate became a source of entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Physical Activity:** Attempts were made to learn handstands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, play impromptu basketball with trash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>, or walk 1000 laps around the room to maintain sanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.
*   **Escapism through Sleep:** The participant tried to sleep through most of the challenge, which helped pass time but also contributed to other issues like feeling hungry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Sleeping in the bathroom, where it was darker, allowed for 12 hours of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Inventing Scenarios:** To prevent intense depression, the individual started to invent concepts and scenarios in their mind, such as envisioning a walk in a park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

As the experiment drew to a close, the [[psychological_impact_of_isolation | psychological impact of isolation]] became overwhelming. The participant expressed feeling "dead" and desperately wanting to leave the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. The inability to distinguish time and the constant state of understimulation led to mental collapse and dysfunction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. Upon exiting the room, the participant initially forgot how to interact with other humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.

A series of extreme [[highstakes_physical_challenges | high-stakes physical challenges]] involving elaborate laser mazes were created, with the goal of one contestant surviving the longest to win $250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The setting for these [[survival_challenges | survival challenges]] was a giant spaceship, due to a previous video where the entire planet was "accidentally blown up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Challenge Levels

### Room Number One
This initial laser obstacle was described as the "most insane" ever created, yet also the "simplest of all the rooms" built for the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Goal**: Touch a box containing $250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Penalty**: Touching a laser results in immediate loss of the $250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Contestants**: Ten contestants started the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: Several contestants were eliminated, leaving nine remaining after the first round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Level Two: Closing Laser Walls
This level required contestants to navigate a course and traverse a wall while red laser walls continuously closed in on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Difficulty**: Described as very difficult, with the host stating he "didn't even get close to pass" when he tried it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: Footage review revealed multiple eliminations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Five contestants remained after this level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### Level Three: Moving Platforms and Balance Beam
Contestants had 10 minutes to navigate this level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Challenge**: Get onto a moving platform, walk across a wobbling balance beam, get on another moving platform, and jump to safety, all while avoiding lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: Contestants successfully navigated the challenge, with one noting it was "the hardest one so far" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

### Level Four: Giant Death Beams
This level featured "giant death beams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   **Challenge**: Reach the other side without touching red lasers or being "cremated" by giant blue "death lasers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The blue lasers provided a warning flash before firing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: Four contestants survived this round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

### Laser Prison (Level Five)
Contestants were trapped in a "giant laser prison" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Challenge**: At a random point within 10 hours, the lasers would turn off for exactly 3.5 seconds, during which contestants had to run and touch the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. The room was "massive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Conditions**: Contestants waited for 7 hours, experiencing hunger and tiredness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. [[MrBeast challenges | MrBeast]] provided them with food and Prime Hydration drinks during the wait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: Despite the long wait and short window, all remaining contestants successfully touched the money, demonstrating surprising alertness at 5 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

### Level Seven: Prime Hydration Challenge
This level served as a product placement challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   **Challenge**: Jump from platform to platform while avoiding floor lasers, all while holding a bottle of Prime Hydration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Lasers briefly disappeared every 30 seconds, offering a risky running option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. The platforms got further apart as contestants progressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.
*   **Incentive**: Completing the course while holding the Prime bottle earned an additional $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: One contestant was eliminated after touching a laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>, though they still received the $10,000 bonus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

### Level Seven (Re-entry): The Choice Challenge
With three contestants remaining, they were given a choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
*   **Choice**: Eliminate themselves and win a Tesla (valued at $40,000) or continue competing for the $250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.
*   **Challenge**: The laser maze itself was extremely tight and narrow, with two paths, one of which was a dead end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. One contestant "broke the game" by jumping over a laser wall to find an easier path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: All three remaining contestants chose to forgo the guaranteed Tesla and continued for the $250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. All successfully navigated the maze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

### Level Eight: Friends' Lasers
For this level, the host's friends (Nolan, Tareq, and Karl) each placed one laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.
*   **Laser Descriptions**:
    *   Nolan's laser: "up and down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.
    *   Tareq's laser: "side to side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.
    *   Karl's laser: A more complex, green laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.
*   **Challenge**: Navigate the three distinct laser patterns.
*   **Outcome**: One contestant quickly found the path and completed it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>. Another was eliminated by the green laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. The final contestant narrowly avoided elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>.

### Final Level (Level Nine/Final): Combined Mazes
The final level combined elements from all previous mazes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. With only two contestants remaining, the rules shifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.
*   **Goal**: The first contestant to touch the money wins instantly, OR if their opponent touches a laser first, they are eliminated, and the other contestant wins instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: Contestants had 30 seconds to devise a strategy, choosing between playing offense (running for the money) or defense (waiting for the opponent to make a mistake) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: One contestant chose to "send it" and run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. This contestant hit a laser, leading to the other contestant's victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. The runner-up received an additional $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>.

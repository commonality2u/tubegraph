The construction and purpose of the [[Ancient Egyptian History and Architecture | Great Pyramids of Egypt]] have long been subjects of various theories and myths. While [[Ancient Egyptian History and Architecture | Egyptologists]] maintain a strong consensus, other theories persist regarding their origin and hidden secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Alternative Construction Theories
Some theories propose that the pyramids were built by a pre-Egyptian civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Even "crazier theories" attribute their construction to aliens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. However, [[Ancient Egyptian History and Architecture | Egyptologists]] are "sure" that the pyramids were constructed by the first Egyptians to serve as [[Ancient Pharaohs and Their Tombs | tombs for their kings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. An Egyptian expert explicitly states that Egyptians are the builders, dismissing the alien theory as impossible given the presence of 124 pyramids across Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

## Hidden Secrets and Conspiracies
One popular conspiracy theory suggests that there is a temple buried beneath the Sphinx filled with gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. However, Dr. Zahi, a prominent [[Exploration of the Pyramids | Egyptologist]], affirmed that there is "nothing inside the Sphinx" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, thereby debunking this particular theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>.

## Evidence Supporting Egyptian Construction
Several pieces of evidence reinforce the belief that ancient Egyptians built the pyramids:
*   **Workman's Tombs:** Excavations at the workman's tombs, where the pyramid builders were buried over 4,600 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>, reveal skeletons of men and women with stress on their backs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. This physical evidence is consistent with the manual labor required to move two-ton blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>, further dismissing alien theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.
*   **Internal Graffiti:** Inside the Great Pyramid, graffiti has been found, such as the name "Heber" (meaning "team") and "Simsu" (meaning "friends"), along with a cartouche for Khufu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. This translates to "the group friends/gang of Khufu" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>, and was written 4,600 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. Researchers consider this graffiti "the nail in the coffin" for anyone who doubts that [[Ancient Egyptian History and Architecture | ancient Egyptians]] built these pyramids as [[Ancient Pharaohs and Their Tombs | tombs for their pharaohs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.

A unique challenge was presented to find a specific individual anywhere in the world to win $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This scenario exemplifies [[creative_ways_to_win_money_or_prizes | creative ways to win money or prizes]] by identifying a specific person.

## The Challenge

The target was described as an old man wearing a Hawaiian shirt, shorts, and specific shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The search had a strict time limit of 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## The Search

The initial strategy involved traveling to Cabo, based on the description of the target as a "beach type guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Upon arrival in Mexico, a boat was rented to aid in the search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

During the search, many individuals were found who nearly matched the description, but each lacked at least one required feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. After extensive searching, a perfect match was located, but he declined to participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

A new [[creative_approaches_in_winning_prizes | creative approach]] was devised: purchasing 10 Hawaiian shirts and strategically leaving them out, hoping people would wear them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

As the deadline approached, with only two hours remaining, the searcher began to feel that success might not be possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This feeling of defeat intensified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## The Breakthrough

With only an hour left, the specific individual was found sitting in the lobby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## The Reward

The person, referred to as "Mr. Emoji guy," was informed of his unexpected win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. He was congratulated for winning $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

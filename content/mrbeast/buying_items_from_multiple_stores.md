In a large-scale philanthropic endeavor, the content creator purchased every item from five different stores. This initiative aimed to donate the vast majority of purchased goods to various charities and individuals in need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Store 1: Clothing Store

The first store targeted was a clothing store, with the intention to buy every single item available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This included high-value items like jackets costing $340 a piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> and an estimated $7,000 worth of beanies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The staff initially had to hand-type every item purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. To expedite the process, a lump sum of $85,000 was negotiated for the entire store's inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

All purchased clothing items were subsequently donated to The Salvation Army, specifically a new store that lacked inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This demonstrated the [[logistics_of_buying_and_donating_large_quantities | logistics of buying and donating large quantities]] required for such an operation.

## Store 2: GameStop

Following the clothing store, the team aimed to buy every item in a GameStop location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Instructions were given for individuals to clear specific walls of merchandise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. The purchases included not just games but also accessories and even display racks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

The process involved filling five shopping carts with video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The initial total for the games quickly reached $30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The entire GameStop store was emptied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. All the purchased games were wrapped and donated to the Boys & Girls Club, a charity supporting children in need, to provide them with a "best Christmas ever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Store 3: Car Lot

For the third store, the team revisited a car lot, marking their second time purchasing every car there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. The objective was to give away all the cars to customers for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

Coaches and team members were assigned to help distribute the cars, and the vehicles were given away to individuals who came to the lot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This included various models, such as a "Call of Duty" Hummer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The [[shopping_sprees_for_individuals_in_need | shopping sprees for individuals in need]] directly benefited the recipients, with one person expressing they needed a nicer car for their family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a> and another receiving a car for their son getting his permit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. The final car, a stick shift, was given to a cameraman who knew how to drive it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

## Store 4: Sports Store

The fourth store involved buying all inventory from a sports equipment store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. The vast amount of merchandise, including baseball bats costing $500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, made it a very expensive undertaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

The entire store's contents were donated to local high school coaches, who were invited to take whatever equipment their teams needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Many coaches expressed gratitude, noting that their schools, especially those in low-poverty areas, often lacked necessary equipment like shoulder pads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. The total cost for the sports store was $85,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

## Store 5: Food Lion (Grocery Store)

The final store was a Food Lion grocery store. The challenge of emptying an entire grocery store was immense due to the sheer volume of products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Initial efforts showed minimal impact on the store's inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Despite spending over $30,000 on food early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, progress was slow, leading to the call for additional help from the store's employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

Ultimately, instead of buying the entire store, a decision was made to purchase only half of the inventory to ensure food remained available for the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. The manager confirmed a food truck would restock the store by the next morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. The total cost for half the Food Lion store was $122,082.15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. Over 300 carts were filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, and seven U-Haul trucks were packed with food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

The purchased food was delivered to the creator's own food pantry, Beast Philanthropy, where over 30,000 meals had already been distributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. This large donation was expected to double that number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. The goal of the food pantry is to change lives and eventually feed millions of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

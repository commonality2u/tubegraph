This article discusses [[high_stakes_challenges | high stakes challenges]] where participants are given a choice between a guaranteed sum of money and a riskier option with a potentially greater reward. These scenarios highlight various aspects of [[risktaking_and_its_consequences | risktaking and its consequences]], [[incentives_and_motivations_in_challenges | incentives and motivations]], and [[high_stakes_challenge_strategies | decision-making under pressure]].

## Cash vs. Key to a Car
In one challenge, a participant named Javier was given 10 seconds to choose between $10,000 cash or a key that went to "something expensive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.
Javier chose the key, stating he had to go with his gut feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The key led to a brand new car worth $26,000, significantly more than the initial cash offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This scenario demonstrated a successful instance of [[surprise_rewards_and_risktaking_in_games | risktaking]].

## The Diamond Pick
Another challenge involved choosing between two diamonds: one worth $25 and the other $6,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. A participant selected one based on feeling and appearance, believing one looked "faker" or "plastic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Ultimately, she picked the $25 diamond, learning that the most important thing she got out of it was "friendship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Tiered Money Flip Challenge
A contestant named Chandler participated in a series of coin flips where he could risk his current winnings for a chance at a larger prize.
*   **Initial Flip**: He successfully flipped a cardboard sign for $1,000, rather than $0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Risk for $10,000**: He then risked the $1,000 to flip for $10,000, which he won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. His motivation was "I didn't wait this whole time for a thousand dollars. I'm going big, or I'm going home!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Risk for $20,000**: Chandler risked his $10,000 for $20,000, which he also won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Decision at $20,000**: Offered the chance to risk $20,000 for $40,000, Chandler decided to keep the $20,000, stating he "came here to win" and "felt I've done that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. His girlfriend, via FaceTime, also advised him that "$20,000's a lot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

## Catching Money from a Height
Participants were positioned in a circle as large amounts of money were dropped from a crane overhead. Whatever they caught, they could keep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   Tim caught $1,929 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   Noah, given a choice of a hat, shirt, or umbrella to catch money, chose the hat and caught $1,920 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## Free Throw Challenges
Basketball free throws were used in several [[high_stakes_challenges | high stakes challenges]]:
*   **Juliana's Free Throw**: Juliana chose to shoot a free throw for $10,000 instead of taking $2,000 cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. She successfully made the shot, winning the $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Chandler's Initial Bet**: Chandler was offered to bet $10,000 on a free throw, where if he missed, he would give $10,000 to charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. He missed, losing the $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. He later lamented that no one talked him out of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This demonstrates the [[risktaking_and_its_consequences | consequences of risktaking]].
*   **Chandler's Redemption Arc**:
    *   He was given a chance to win back money. He first made a shot for $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
    *   He then made a three-pointer for $10,000, making up for his earlier loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
    *   He then risked his $10,000 to shoot for $20,000, which he also made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
    *   Finally, he risked the $20,000 for a chance at $50,000 from a long distance shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. He missed the shot, resulting in him still owing the initial $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
*   **Zach's Redemption for Chandler**: Chandler's brother, Zach, was given a chance to win back Chandler's $10,000 by popping balloons.
    *   He won $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.
    *   He won another $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.
    *   He won $10,000, officially getting Chandler "outta debt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.
    *   He then risked it for $20,000 (won) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.
    *   He finally went for $30,000 but missed, putting Chandler back in debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

## Tesla Cheese Ball Challenge
Noah, after catching money, challenged Jimmy for his Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. The challenge involved guessing which of 10 cups had a cheese ball under it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. One cup was immediately removed as incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Noah, facing a one-in-nine chance, randomly picked the correct cup, winning Chris's Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. He also got to keep the $1,900 he caught earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

## Guess the Car Sound Challenge
Cameron was presented with two car sounds; one was real, the other fake. If he guessed the real one, he would win a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Cameron chose sound number one, believing he could hear "shifting" in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. However, sound number one was revealed to be a person making car noises with their mouth, while the real car was shown for sound number two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Cameron did not win the car.

## Two Keys, Eight Cups Challenge
Troy participated in a challenge where he had to pick one of eight cups, two of which contained car keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. He had a 25% chance of winning a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. Troy successfully picked a cup with a key, winning a brand new car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

## Continuous Counting Challenge
Anna and Juliana were tasked with counting as high as they could, with each number earning them a dollar. The risk was that if they skipped a number, they would lose everything and go back to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Anna initially failed by skipping a number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Later, they were given a one-hour time limit but did not have to restart their count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. They reached a final count of $14,439, which they won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. Anna stated she would use the money to pay off her student loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

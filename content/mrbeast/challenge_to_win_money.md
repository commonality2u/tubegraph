In a unique contest, participants were given the opportunity to win $100,000 for a loved one, specifically a sister's college tuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The core mechanic involved pressing a button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A single random press could result in winning the $100,000 prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, but most presses led to an "insanely stupid and random punishment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Challenge Structure and Rules

Friends were gathered to participate in this game of chance and consequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Each button press triggered either a punishment or the grand prize.

A "skip" button was introduced, allowing a participant to avoid a disliked punishment once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. If a participant was actively engaged in a challenge, they were exempt from new punishments, such as Tags not being pied while breaking the two-by-four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

In a unique challenge, two strangers, Bailey and Suzie, were tasked with surviving 100 days in a massive isolation chamber to win a grand prize of half a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The core [[High Stakes Challenges | high stakes]] incentive was clear: if one person left before 100 days, both would receive nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Initial Conditions and Early Challenges
The participants were provided with enough healthy, but repetitive, food for 100 days, a private bathroom with a shower, and a bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Despite having all basic necessities, the challenge soon became about endurance against boredom and monotony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Early struggles included disorientation due to the lack of external time cues, leading to poor sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, constant bright lights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, and extreme boredom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Periodic Temptations and Participant Decisions
Throughout the challenge, the host introduced [[prize_incentives_and_participant_decisions | temptations]] in the form of items or services that could make their lives easier, but at the cost of their prize money. These offers aimed to test their [[incentives_and_motivations_in_challenges | motivations]] and resilience.

### Day 10: Private Chef
After ten days of eating the same food, the first offer was a private chef for $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Despite being tempted by a lavish meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, both Suzie and Bailey surprisingly declined the offer, demonstrating initial strong resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### Day 20: Comfort and Light Control
By day 20, the constant bright lights and uncomfortable sleeping conditions became a major issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. The offer was two smart beds and an iPad to control the lights for $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Suzie was initially very happy and eager to accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, but Bailey ultimately said no, to the surprise of the host, leading to Suzie's immediate regret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

### Day 30: Small Luxuries
Recognizing their cravings for specific comforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, the day 30 offer presented five individual items, each costing $10,000:
*   A phone call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>
*   The entire Harry Potter collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>
*   A coffee machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>
*   Spices, salt, and pepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>
*   Monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>

This time, the participants caved, purchasing the coffee machine and the Harry Potter books for a total of $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### Day 40: Entertainment - The TV
After a power outage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, the day 40 offer was a TV, with each movie costing $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. They rejected this offer, but cleverly outsmarted the challenge by using a frayed wire as an antenna to access seven digital channels for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. This unexpected success allowed them to enjoy entertainment without spending money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

### Day 50: Family Visit
For day 50, the challenge presented an emotional [[unexpected_events_and_complications_during_the_challenge | temptation]]: the chance to see their family for $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. While Bailey was immediately on board, Suzie hesitated due to the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Ultimately, they agreed to spend the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. The visit, while brief, brought immense joy and a birthday celebration for Suzie's mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>, though it also left them feeling the "worst feeling so far" when their families left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

### Day 60: The Mystery Box (Teslas)
Based on Suzie's earlier comment about wanting a Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>, the day 60 offer was a "mystery gift" for $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. Despite Suzie's strong intuition that it might be a car, Bailey was unconvinced about the value matching the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. They decided against it, only to discover the box contained $50,000 (their money back) and two Tesla keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. This outcome led to significant regret and disappointment, especially for Suzie, who "whined about the Tesla for nine days straight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.

### Day 70: The Final Bundle Offer
The final offer on day 70 bundled all previously rejected items and some new ones: two smart beds, a new mystery box, phone calls, spices, Monopoly, every movie from a Walmart aisle, and a private chef <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. This comprehensive package was offered through a bidding system: they had to bid higher than a hidden number, or they would get nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. They deliberated on their bid, eventually settling on $100,101 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. The hidden number was $69,000, meaning they overpaid, but secured all the items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>. The new mystery box contained two smaller Teslas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.

## Impact of Acquired Items and Deteriorating Relationship
Ironically, getting more items did not necessarily lead to greater happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. While they now had entertainment, the close quarters and differing preferences led to growing friction, with arguments over showers, movies, and games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. Bailey felt he was "sharing a space with an annoying sibling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, and Suzie even hid the Monopoly dice to avoid playing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>. The increased amenities seemed to highlight their personal incompatibilities.

## Day 100: The Ultimate Test - Split or Steal?
On the final day, with 24 hours remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>, the ultimate [[risk_versus_reward_challenges | risk-versus-reward]] decision was presented:
*   **Split**: Both choose "split," and they equally share the remaining prize money.
*   **Steal**: One chooses "steal," the other chooses "split," and the "stealer" takes all the money.
*   **Nothing**: Both choose "steal," and both get nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.

This final [[competitive_environment_and_pressure_in_challenges | competitive environment and pressure]] tested their relationship built over 100 days. Despite individual thoughts about potentially stealing to maximize their gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>, both Suzie and Bailey ultimately chose "split," valuing their shared experience and effort over individual greed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>. They successfully completed the challenge and split the money, exiting the chamber after 100 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>.

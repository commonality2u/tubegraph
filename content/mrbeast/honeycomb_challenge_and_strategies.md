The Honeycomb challenge is the second game in Mr. Beast's recreated *Squid Game* competition, following Red Light, Green Light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Game Objective and Rules
Each contestant receives a needle and a cookie with a unique shape embossed on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The objective is to remove the shape from the cookie using only the needle within a 10-minute time limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. If the shape breaks during the process, the contestant is eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## Gameplay and [[Contestant competition strategies | Strategies]]
Contestants initially line up in front of question marks to select their cookies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Some players attempt to choose a position in the middle, hoping to avoid the more complex "umbrella" shape, which is widely considered difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. The shapes revealed include circle, star, triangle, and umbrella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

The challenge begins with all contestants scraping at their cookies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. One contestant attempts to cheat by bringing a lighter to melt the sugar, though it is unclear if this strategy was successful or utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Successful completion of the challenge is met with cheers and relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

## Outcomes
Out of the 232 participants who survived Red Light, Green Light, 142 advanced past the Honeycomb challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Eliminated players received $2,000 in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. An additional offer was made for contestants to voluntarily leave the competition for $4,000, which some accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

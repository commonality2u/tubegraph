During challenges, the interactions between participants and their friends often involve a mix of support, teasing, and competitive elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Friends frequently provide safety measures and monitoring, while simultaneously engaging in pranks and playful harassment to test endurance or simply for amusement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Initial Setup and Rules

At the start of a challenge, friends often participate in the setup, including sealing participants into their challenge space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. They maintain communication, checking in on the participant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a> and observing key moments, like the placement of a tombstone in a buried alive challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. A common element of these challenges is a "tase clause," where if the participant exits early, they face a specific consequence, such as being tased by their friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This adds an element of playful [[friendship_and_competition_dynamics | competition]] and motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Despite the pranks, participant safety is often prioritized with monitoring systems and medics on standby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Pranks and Harassment

A significant aspect of [[team_dynamics_and_humor_in_long_challenges | friend dynamics in long challenges]] involves playful harassment. This can include:
*   **Waking the participant with noise** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Threatening and simulating acts of annoyance**, such as pretending to urinate on the participant's grave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Taunting with descriptions of outside freedom**, like discussing standing or getting food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Playing disruptive noises** over walkie-talkies, such as train sounds or music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Manipulating environmental controls**, like turning off lights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Spreading misinformation or exaggerated threats**, such as claiming a tornado is approaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Reminding the participant of consequences**, such as clicking a taser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

These actions often lead to frustration for the participant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, who may try to retaliate by removing communication devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Unexpected Visits and Support

Friends may undertake elaborate efforts to visit and interact with the participant, even if it means digging large holes to reach them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. While these visits can be framed as acts of friendship, they often include more pranks, such as drawing on the challenge space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Despite the teasing, there's an underlying current of support; for example, one friend, Nolan, was specifically mentioned as being the only one who would consistently visit during the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

## Final Hours and Release

As the challenge nears its end, friends often engage in final acts of celebration or last-minute mischief. This can involve loud noises, such as sledgehammering the ground or setting off fireworks, which can be felt and smelled by the participant underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. The friends are responsible for retrieving the participant once the challenge is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. Upon release, immediate reactions from friends often include observations about the participant's physical state or smell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, emphasizing the reality of the challenge completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. Overall, [[social_dynamics_in_group_challenges | group dynamics]] throughout the challenge demonstrate a unique blend of camaraderie, competitive spirit, and humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

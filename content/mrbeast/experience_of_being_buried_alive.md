Below, we delve into his experience, extracting key moments and details from the event.

## Initial Reactions and Setup

MrBeast's adventure began with a sense of apprehension as he described the challenge as possibly the "dumbest thing" he's ever attempted. Despite the intimidating nature of the task [[challenges_faced_during_the_burial | challenges faced during the burial]], he humorously noted the moment of burial as the last time he'd see the outside world for 50 hours, setting up a blend of excitement and fear (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>).

The burial process itself was intensive, involving the use of an excavator to pile dirt over the coffin, which MrBeast could physically feel pressing down on him, enhancing the sensation of being confined (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>).

## Coping Mechanisms and Challenges

Once buried, MrBeast had to adapt to his unique environment. With a limited amount of space to move and the constant pressure of earth above him, he described moments of discomfort and the onset of claustrophobia. He humorously noted, "Why are coffins so small?" when he found himself wanting to stretch or move around significantly (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>).

To deal with the psychological aspect of being buried [[psychological_effects_of_confinement | psychological effects of confinement]], MrBeast found small ways to entertain himself, such as [[coping_mechanisms_while_buried | coping mechanisms while buried]] interacting with his friends via a walkie-talkie, and humorously managing the mini-adventures within his confined space, such as moving a camera with his toes (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>).

## Support Systems in Place

Throughout the challenge, MrBeast's friends played a pivotal role in maintaining his morale, albeit through unconventional means [[friends_interactions_and_support_during_the_challenge | friends interactions and support during the challenge]]. They interacted with him regularly via walkie-talkie, sometimes opting to annoy him for entertainment. At one point, they even tunneled down to his coffin to graffiti it, illustrating a mix of support and hijinks (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>).

From a safety standpoint, MrBeast had several precautions in place [[safety_measures_taken_for_the_burial_challenge | safety measures taken for the burial challenge]] including an air conditioning system for ventilation, constant monitoring, and having a medic on standby. This ensured that despite the daunting nature of the challenge, his well-being was closely monitored (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>).

## Psychological Effects and Conclusion

Over the 50-hour period, MrBeast highlighted the psychological challenges [[psychological_and_physical_challenges_of_endurance_competitions | psychological and physical challenges of endurance competitions]] of being buried alive. He reported feeling bored, claustrophobic, and experiencing discomfort due to the limited space and lack of mobility. However, he managed to keep his spirits up by maintaining a humorous outlook throughout the ordeal (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>).

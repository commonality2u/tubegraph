A [[high_stakes_challenges | high stakes challenge]] to evade a professional bounty hunter for a $100,000 reward involves a series of [[high_stakes_challenge_strategies | high stakes challenge strategies]] incorporating elaborate deceptions, rapid vehicle changes, and unique hideouts across various locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The objective is to keep a backpack containing $100,000 away from the bounty hunter until midnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Initial Escape and Vehicle Changes

The challenge begins with an immediate escape, with the participant using a helicopter and a dozen cars initially lined up for the chase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

*   **First Car Switch**
    The participant's initial strategy involved driving to the closest dealership to buy a new car, knowing the bounty hunter would track the original vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. A car was prepared ahead of time and purchased for $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The bounty hunter team discovered the car switch by tracking the participant's phone to the dealership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Second Car Ditch**
    After the bounty hunter learned the make of the new car (a Kia Soul), the participant decided to ditch it as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **ATV Escape**
    In a large field, a pre-arranged ATV was used as a getaway vehicle, placed behind a bar to prevent the pursuers from driving their cars into the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. The ATV was then abandoned near train tracks due to the terrain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **Third Car Purchase**
    At a dock, another car was purchased from a waiting contact for $20,000 to continue the escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

## Elaborate Concealment Tactics

Throughout the chase, various intricate methods were employed to hide and mislead the pursuers. These [[creative_stunts_and_highrisk_video_challenges | creative stunts and highrisk video challenges]] aim to create confusion and buy time.

*   **Bank Vault Hideout**
    The participant hid in a warehouse containing a bank-grade vault, sealing themselves inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This was a deceptive maneuver, as a secret tunnel under the safe allowed for an escape to a pre-planted U-Haul truck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Movie Theater Deception**
    An entire movie theater was rented out to serve as a hideout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. The participant hid behind a secret door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a> and used security cameras on their phone to monitor the bounty hunter's movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. A fire alarm was pre-disconnected and then activated to force an evacuation and provide a window for escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

## Outdoor Escapes and Diversions

The chase extended to open environments, using large-scale diversions and pre-planned setups to evade capture.

*   **Helicopter and Porta-Potty Diversion**
    In a "ginormous field," a helicopter and multiple porta-potties were set up as a diversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. The helicopter lifted one of the porta-potties while the participant pretended to be inside it via a phone call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Simultaneously, the participant was hidden in another car concealed behind a bush in the woods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   **Mansion and Boat Escape**
    A rented mansion was used as a temporary resting point, equipped with security cameras to detect the bounty hunter's arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Upon detection, the participant immediately fled via a boat kept at the mansion's dock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

### Unexpected Encounters

During the extensive chase, the participant engaged in one notable [[unexpected_encounters_during_the_challenge | unexpected encounter during the challenge]].

*   **$10,000 Hat Purchase**
    While crossing a large field in extreme heat, the participant encountered a stranger and convinced them to sell their hat for $10,000 to "cool off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## Final Confrontation and Unused Plans

The chase culminated in a direct confrontation, with some planned strategies not being fully utilized due to the bounty hunter's persistence.

*   **"Sacrifice" of a Companion**
    As the chase reached an abandoned hospital, the participant instructed their companion, Tariq, to "sacrifice" himself by tackling the bounty hunter, allowing the participant to escape with the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. This was described as a "college, D1 lineman" tackle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. The bounty hunter succeeded in intercepting the participant after a brief struggle where a friend hugged the participant, allowing the bounty hunter to catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
*   **Planned but Unused Hideouts**
    The participant had pre-arranged further [[stunt_experiments_and_pranks | stunt experiments and pranks]] and hideouts that were not reached, including an abandoned hospital filled with hundreds of mannequins to hide amongst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, and a hotel where every room was rented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

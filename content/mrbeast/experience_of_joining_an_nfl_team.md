The experience of joining an NFL team was presented as a high-paying job opportunity, potentially worth $10 million a year, and described as a literal dream for the participant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

## Signing the Contract
The participant signed a contract to become an official player for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Although the contract nominally stated a $10 million value, a caveat noted that the payment would not actually be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. For the next 48 hours, the participant was officially a Buccaneers player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. The ultimate goal by the end of the contract was to run out with the team onto the field in front of 60,000 fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

## Training and Practice
The first step was weight training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. NFL players are often yelled at during training, and the participant found the NFL workout to be significantly harder than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. An NFL player's typical workout regimen was described as "pretty pathetic" compared to the participant's attempts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

The first practice took place at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers training facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. During this session, the participant:
*   Met the team's coach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
*   Met new teammates, including a player named Shaq whose kids loved his videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
*   Showed his contract to teammates who expressed surprise at the supposed value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
*   Was assigned as a kicker due to never having played football before, at which he was "terrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
*   Attempted to play quarterback, throwing the ball "as far as I could" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
*   Surprised Tom Brady during practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   Participated in a press conference set up by the Buccaneers to address questions about his two-day contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. He clarified that it was a publicity stunt and he did not expect any playing time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

## Game Day Experience
Prior to game day, the participant was measured, coming in at six feet four and a half inches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. Custom-fitted gear and a uniform were provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

On game day, the team allowed him to lead them out of the tunnel onto the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. He received enthusiastic support from his friends in the stands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. The experience of joining the NFL team was described as the "best day of my life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

## Aftermath
The participant did not play in the game, acknowledging that a hit from an NFL player would likely have been fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. Following the event, the Falcons tweeted a comment, prompting a retaliatory response from the participant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. This specific mention of the Falcons and a "nuking their stadium" comment suggests an element of [[competing_against_professional_athletes_for_charity_or_cash | competition]] or rivalry, although the nature of the "nuking" is clearly hyperbole.

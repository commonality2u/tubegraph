In a challenge where 100 subscribers were given $10,000 each and then hunted for 10 hours inside one of the world's largest malls, the [[incentives_and_motivations_in_challenges | motivation]] to win and keep the money was high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. If found before morning, the $10,000 was taken back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>; if they survived, they kept it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This significant cash prize served as a powerful incentive for contestants to employ various [[contestant_competition_strategies | hiding strategies]] and endure the arduous 10-hour hunt.

## Financial Impact

For many participants, the $10,000 prize represented a life-changing sum. Their stated reasons for wanting to win often revolved around improving their financial situations or providing for their families.

*   **College Expenses:** One contestant explicitly stated, "I'm a super broke college student. This money would actually change my life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This highlights the desire for financial stability and the alleviation of educational burdens.
*   **Family Support:** Another participant shared, "10 grand would definitely mean a lot for, not only me, but for my family" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This shows a broader motivation beyond individual gain, focusing on the [[impact_of_winning_on_contestants_lives | positive impact]] on their loved ones.
*   **Vacation for Children:** Upon successfully completing the challenge, one winner exclaimed, "My kids are gonna have a real vacation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>, underscoring the desire to provide experiences for their family.

## Avoiding Early Elimination

The pressure of not being the first one caught was also a significant motivator. One contestant mentioned, "Yo, my parents literally told me not to be the first person out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, indicating a fear of embarrassment or disappointing others, in addition to losing the prize money.

## Endurance and Strategic Play

As the challenge wore on, contestants' determination to keep the money remained strong, even as fatigue set in.

*   **Last-Minute Perseverance:** With only 15 minutes left, one contestant confidently declared, "Nothing can stop me. I'm ready. I'm winning this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This demonstrates a strong commitment to winning despite the exhaustion.
*   **Avoiding Elimination at Any Cost:** Another participant expressed the emotional toll of potential failure, stating, "I'd cry real tears if I get eliminated at this point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. This highlights the high stakes and the personal investment in the outcome after hours of hiding and avoiding capture.

The combination of significant financial reward and the inherent challenge of evasion kept the contestants highly motivated throughout the 10-hour hunt.

The team, led by MrBeast, set out to break the world record for [[elephant_toothpaste_experiment | elephant toothpaste]] as part of a grand prank on his brother CJ, filling his house with the substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The Existing Record

The previous world record for [[elephant_toothpaste_experiment | elephant toothpaste]] involved approximately 290 gallons of hydrogen peroxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## The Record Attempt

To achieve a new world record, the team planned to use 500 gallons of hydrogen peroxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This amount was almost double the existing record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

For this ambitious endeavor, MrBeast brought in Mark Rober, an expert who holds two existing world records involving [[elephant_toothpaste_experiment | elephant toothpaste]] and has produced multiple videos on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The reaction was prepared using 14 drums of chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## The Reaction

A small-scale test of the [[elephant_toothpaste_experiment | elephant toothpaste]] in a bathroom revealed the immense heat generated by the reaction, causing steam and covering the ceiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. When unleashed in CJ's house as part of the [[pranking_brothers_with_elephant_toothpaste | prank]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, the massive volume of foam erupted from windows and even the chimney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. The foam was described as "hot" and "steamy" by those observing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

The challenge began with 100 boys in one circle and 100 girls in another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The objective was for the team with more participants remaining after 100 hours to win $500,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This half a million dollars would then be split amongst all members of the winning team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## The Final Hour

Leading up to the final hour, the challenge saw participants strategize to maintain their numbers and space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. Teams had to decide which sections of their circle to block off every hour in the last 10 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Despite temptations and unexpected eliminations due to sloppiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>, both teams made it to the final hour with participants grouped together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. The count was described as "dead even" even after 90 hours, making the outcome statistically improbable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. This last hour was crucial, as it would determine who would [[winning_and_allocation_of_prize_money_in_challenges | win]] the [[large_cash_prizes_in_competitive_events | half a million dollars]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

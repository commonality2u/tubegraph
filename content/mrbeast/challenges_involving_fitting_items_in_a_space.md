Various large-scale competitions feature [[creative_problemsolving_in_extreme_challenges | challenges]] that involve contestants attempting to fit as many items as possible within a defined space, typically a large red triangle or oval, to win prizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A key rule across these challenges is that if any part of an item touches the boundary line of the designated space, the contestant loses the items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Strategies and Implementations

### Stacking and Creating Structures
Participants often employ clever [[strategies_and_challenges_in_constructing_tall_lego_structures | strategies]] to maximize the volume of items within the space:
*   **Building Tables:** Contestants use large flat items, such as televisions, as base "tables" to stack more items on top, effectively creating multiple layers of usable space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. One instance saw an 85-inch TV placed on top of another to form a double table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Vertical Stacking:** Items like boxes of Funko Pops are stacked vertically to utilize height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This method, however, introduces instability, with boxes beginning to bow under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Perimeter Building:** Establishing a perimeter with larger items allows for smaller items to be placed within the enclosed space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Precision Placement:** Participants use tape measures to precisely calculate the dimensions of both the triangle and the items, ensuring a perfect fit and preventing items from touching the boundary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Even shoveling items into small cracks between boxes is utilized to fit more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### Challenge Locations and Prizes

The challenge is adapted to various environments and prize types:

*   **Retail Store (Electronics):**
    *   In a location resembling a large electronics store, one contestant, Adam, managed to fit over $23,000 worth of items, including multiple large TVs, by stacking them into a "TV table" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **GameStop:**
    *   Contestants were tasked with fitting the entire contents of a GameStop store into a triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
    *   Early attempts led to [[challenges_and_eliminations_in_a_largescale_competition | eliminations]], as one contestant, Zealous, lost by accidentally touching the red line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
    *   Later, Patrick and Dave successfully fitted the entire GameStop store by building a complex, tall structure of boxes and items within the triangle, winning the entire store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

*   **Car Dealership:**
    *   A contestant named Shirley aimed to fit as many cars as possible into a giant red triangle at a car dealership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Boards were used to guide the cars over the line without touching the boundary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Shirley successfully fit five cars, winning over $100,000 worth of vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. She was initially unaware she won all five cars, believing it was only one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

*   **Open Field (Skydiving):**
    *   Skydiver Dino was challenged to jump from a plane and land within a red triangle on the ground for $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Tareq, despite his fear of heights, joined for an additional $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Dino successfully landed in the triangle, and Tareq's jump secured a total of $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

*   **Wholesale Club (Sam's Club):**
    *   Darren, who runs a food pantry, was given a large triangle at a wholesale club to fill with food items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Despite the large space, he initially only spent $25,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. With the allowance to use pallets, he eventually filled the triangle with $82,058 worth of food, which was then donated to service another community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

*   **Luxury Retail Store:**
    *   Contestant Neil collected high-value items like Alexander McQueens and Supreme brand products, expecting a large triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. He was initially misled by a small pizza box placed as a decoy for the triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. After the actual, much larger triangle was revealed, he successfully fit all his chosen items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

*   **Friendly Rivalry (Chris vs. Chandler):**
    *   In a reciprocal challenge, Chandler filled a triangle for Chris to pay for, and then Chris did the same for Chandler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Chandler's items totaled $6,574.45 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>, while Chris's totaled $4,558.18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. This demonstrated how contestants would act when the cost directly impacted a friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

*   **Karl's Room:**
    *   As a comedic segment, Zealous was challenged to "steal" items from Karl's room by fitting them into an oval drawn on the floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. Items included gaming consoles, a Power Glove, and a mini-fridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. The final setup balanced on two PlayStation 5s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. Ultimately, all "stolen" items were replaced for Karl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

### Charitable Contributions

The challenge also served a charitable purpose, with a large triangle placed in a toy store for Heather, who works at a children's hospital, to fill for donation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. They filled a U-Haul with toys and PlayStation 5s, bringing joy to the children and staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

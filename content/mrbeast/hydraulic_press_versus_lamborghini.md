One of the experimental feats undertaken was to flatten a Lamborghini with a hydraulic press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The objective was to determine how flat the vehicle could become under immense pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

## The Experiment
The experiment involved a massive hydraulic press and a [[lamborghini_destruction | Lamborghini]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. To add an element of survival, crash test mannequins representing the crew were placed inside the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   Chandler's mannequin was placed in a spot, with the belief it was "how you deal with your school bullies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   Karl's mannequin was placed on the hood, based on the theory that "the hood is the safest spot in a car" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   Chris stated he would "guard" Karl's mannequin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

The team gave the order to begin crushing the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

## Results of the Crush
As the hydraulic press descended:
*   Chandler's mannequin was immediately "gone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   Chris's mannequin initially seemed "okay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   The Lamborghini's windows shattered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
*   The tires began collapsing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

Ultimately, the [[lamborghini_protection_challenge | Lamborghini]] was rendered completely inoperable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. However, it did not squish into a complete "pancake" as some had anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

## Further Destruction
To compensate for the car not being completely flattened into a pancake, the team decided to blow up the Lamborghini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

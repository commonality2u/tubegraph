The world's most dangerous escape room was constructed as a challenge for a contestant to win $100,000 if completed in under one hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The challenge consists of 10 different levels, with the timer continuously counting down, and the contestant must find the exit in every level to reach the prize money before time runs out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Level 1: Spikes and Bricks

The first level requires contestants to escape a room before walls with spikes impale them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The room is filled with sand, and the objective is to break through a brick wall to exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The walls actively close in during the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Level 2: The Key Hunt

In the second level, a key is hidden somewhere in the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Meanwhile, the $100,000 prize money is on a conveyor belt, set to be dumped into a fire in 55 minutes if not retrieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Contestants search for the key in various places, including a clock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, a light bulb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, and a toaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The key is ultimately found in a high, out-of-reach location, requiring one contestant to stand on another's back to retrieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Level 3: Minecraft Challenge

This level is themed after the video game Minecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The exit is related to a TNT block in the wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Contestants must use a flaming arrow found in a cave to light the TNT block, mimicking Minecraft gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. After a missed shot, one contestant manually ignites the TNT, causing an explosion that opens the way to the next level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This challenge involves [[Creative stunts and highrisk video challenges | creative stunts and high-risk video challenges]].

## Level 4: The Goat and the Hidden Door

Level four features a room with goats, where the main objective appears to be digging out a key from the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. However, the door is actually unlocked and can be opened at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The challenge is a test of observation, as contestants waste time trying to dig out the key before being hinted that they can "just open the door" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Level 5: Trick Hotel

This level is a "trick hotel" designed in collaboration with Zach King, featuring numerous rooms and secret hallways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. One contestant quickly identifies a fake brick wall and kicks it down to reveal a secret entrance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Level 6: Room of Snakes

Beyond the trick hotel is a room filled with numerous snakes, including one measuring 18 feet long and weighing 200 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The exit involves a pressure plate that must be continuously stood on to keep a door open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This requires one contestant to sacrifice their participation by remaining on the plate while the others proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. This presents [[relationship_challenges_in_confined_spaces | relationship challenges in confined spaces]] and [[highstakes_physical_challenges | high-stakes physical challenges]].

## Level 7: Chocolate Bar Puzzle

Contestants enter a room filled with thousands of chocolate bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. One of these bars contains a mystery ticket on the outside that serves as the exit key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. This level also serves as a promotional segment for the *Feastables* chocolate company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Level 8: Library Book Search

This level is a massive library containing over 1,000 books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Only one specific book opens a trap door leading to the next stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. With 19 minutes remaining, contestants search for the correct book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. To provide a hint, $5,000 of the prize money is burned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, after which the host points in the direction of the correct book, titled "Elon Musk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Level 9: Retrieval Challenge

Akira, the contestant, realizes he needs items from an earlier level (Level 4, the goat level) to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. He must retrieve pickaxes and other tools to continue. With less than 13 minutes remaining, he sprints back to retrieve the necessary items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. If he fails to touch the money within 11.5 minutes, another portion of the prize money is burned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. This exemplifies [[challenges_of_extreme_survival_scenarios | challenges of extreme survival scenarios]] and [[highstakes_physical_challenges | high-stakes physical challenges]].

## Level 10: The Lava Walk

The final level presents a challenge requiring the contestant to cross a path without touching "lava" to reach the remaining prize money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Akira successfully navigates the path, securing the prize with two minutes remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. The money burned throughout the challenge was fake, with the real prize money presented in bags at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This final challenge involves [[worlds_most_deadly_obstacle_course | elements similar to a world's most deadly obstacle course]].

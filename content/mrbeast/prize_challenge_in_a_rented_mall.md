In a large-scale [[challenge_to_win_money | prize challenge]], 100 subscribers were each given $10,000 and then locked inside one of the largest malls in the world for 10 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The objective of this [[survival_challenge_for_money | survival challenge for money]] was for the host to hunt them down; if found, the $10,000 was reclaimed, but if they survived until morning, they would keep the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## The Hunt Begins

The mall was described by participants as "massive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The first contestant found was discovered hiding and subsequently "transformed into a mannequin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Initial search areas included Lego Land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, Toys R Us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, and the ice rink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Some contestants displayed [[creative_approaches_in_winning_prizes | creative approaches in winning prizes]] through hiding spots, such as climbing into the ceiling above a vending machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. After three hours, only seven people had been found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### Seeking Backup

To accelerate the search, the host called in additional team members, including Sapnap and Marques Brownlee, to search areas like the ski resort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Other tactics included checking trashcans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a> and water slides within the mall's water park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Contestants were observed attempting to escape searches by running between different areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### Advanced Search Techniques

With 78 people still remaining and just under six hours left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, the host escalated the search by bringing in a SWAT team at 5:00 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. As an incentive, the SWAT team was offered half the money for every person they found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. The SWAT team utilized a thermal drone to scan the mall for hidden individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a> and quickly found multiple people, including one who had been hiding for five hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:06:00]</a>. The SWAT team successfully found 10 people faster than the original team found two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, earning them $10,000 each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## Strategic Moves to Flush Out Contestants

To further encourage contestants to move, an announcement by Jack Black was broadcast over the mall's speakers, stating that the water park was closing and advising people to find new hiding spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. With 53 people remaining at 7:00 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, the host offered to buy all of his team members' moms a boat if they could reduce the number of remaining contestants to under 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. This motivation proved effective, as the team began finding many more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. One team member even disguised himself as a janitor to search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

By finding over 70 "mannequins" (found contestants), the team achieved their goal, securing new boats for their mothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

## Final Hours and Conclusion

With only 30 minutes remaining, the mall was opened to the public, adding another layer of complexity to the [[winning_and_allocation_of_prize_money_in_challenges | winning and allocation of prize money in challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. In the final minutes, the host even offered a briefcase of money to a bystander if they would reveal hidden contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

As the timer reached zero, the challenge concluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. All remaining contestants officially won $10,000 in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. The host had risked a million dollars but ended up spending approximately half a million on the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

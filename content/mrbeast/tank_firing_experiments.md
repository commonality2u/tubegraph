A series of experiments involving military-grade tanks were conducted, primarily focusing on testing their destructive power against various barriers and a Lamborghini.

## Initial Challenge: Defending a Lamborghini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>
One experiment involved a challenge for Adam to defend a new Lamborghini from a military-grade tank acquired by the host <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. The objective was to protect the car from incoming tank missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Adam was given the host's credit card to spend as much money as needed for defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. If the Lamborghini survived, Adam would keep the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Adam's Defense Strategy
Adam's strategy to protect the Lamborghini involved multiple layers of defense:
*   **Initial Walls** He constructed cinder block walls, aiming for them to be a foot taller than his head to protect against direct shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Water Pools** Inspired by a MythBusters episode, Adam incorporated pools filled with water to absorb the velocity of rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Stacked Cars** He obtained numerous cars from a scrapyard, stacking them in at least two layers, utilizing the engine blocks for greater stopping power than the sides of the vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Final Touches** In total, Adam set up two cinder block walls, two layers of stacked cars, and three full pools of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. During the last night of preparation, he added 20 more cars, four more walls, and two more giant pools, although one of the new pools was not filled due to time constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. He also filled some sections with sand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

### Increased Threat
The challenge was intensified with the introduction of two additional tanks, making it a total of three tanks targeting the Lamborghini from all sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. The host also obtained 20 real tank shells for the experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

## Tank Test Prior to Main Experiment
Before attacking the Lamborghini, a test was conducted with one of the tanks, described as the weakest of the three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. The test setup included a 100-pound safe, a trampoline, and bulletproof glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. The tank round successfully penetrated the bulletproof glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

## Tank Assault on the Lamborghini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>
The three tanks began firing their shells at Adam's fortified Lamborghini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   The first shot hit one of the pools in front of the Lamborghini, causing the water to pour out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   Multiple rapid-fire tank shots were unleashed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, including instances where all three tanks fired simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. The walls made it impossible to see the Lamborghini's status during the firing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

### Outcome
Despite the extensive barrage, the Lamborghini survived without any holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. The stacked cars, while not strong enough to stop the rounds directly, were effective in deflecting them away from the vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. One of the pools also caught a bullet, which was explicitly noted as validation for Adam's MythBusters-inspired strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. Adam successfully won the Lamborghini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

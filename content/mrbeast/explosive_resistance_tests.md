This article details various experiments conducted to test the resistance of objects and structures against powerful forces, including large explosions, tank fire, and extreme crushing.

## Domino Impact Test

The world's new tallest domino was used to crush an entire store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The domino, described as the tallest in the world, was pushed, leading to the complete collapse and destruction of the store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Massive Creeper Explosion

An experiment was conducted to destroy an entire life-sized village using a "massive creeper explosion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This explosion was 50 times larger than a human-sized version and contained 200 times the amount of TNT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The resulting explosion was immense, leaving the participants speechless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Safes vs. [[extreme_dynamite_and_explosives_experiments | Explosives]]

Three different safes were tested against varying amounts of [[extreme_dynamite_and_explosives_experiments | explosives]] to determine their resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>:

### $1,000 Safe Test
A $1,000 safe was targeted with $1,000 worth of TNT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. An egg was placed inside to gauge the impact. The safe and the egg "literally don't exist anymore" after the explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

### $10,000 Safe Test
This safe was 50 times stronger than the previous one, featuring three-inch-thick steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. It was surrounded by 10 times the amount of [[extreme_dynamite_and_explosives_experiments | explosives]] used in the first test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, equivalent to $10,000 worth of TNT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Despite its strength, the safe was significantly damaged, creating a large divot in the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### $100,000 Safe Test
The largest test involved a $100,000 safe, which was surrounded by $100,000 worth of [[extreme_dynamite_and_explosives_experiments | explosives]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. This was described as the biggest explosion ever performed in their videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. The explosion was so powerful it "woke up everybody in the city" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The safe's back was blown out, its foundation cracked, and the egg inside did not survive, indicating that its strength was concentrated in its door rather than its walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

## Lamborghini Defense Against [[tank_firing_experiments | Tank Fire]]

Adam was challenged to protect a Lamborghini from being destroyed by [[tank_firing_experiments | military-grade tank missiles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. He was given three days and an unlimited budget to build a defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### Defense Strategy
Adam constructed a multi-layered defense system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>:
*   **Cinder Block Walls:** Initially, walls were built to be a foot over the Lamborghini's height to protect against direct shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Water Pools:** Inspired by a MythBusters episode, multiple pools of water were strategically placed to reduce the velocity of incoming rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Stacked Cars:** Over 20 cars were stacked in two layers, with the engine blocks facing outwards for increased stopping power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Sand Barriers:** Sand was used inside structures to make them harder to push over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

### The Attack
Originally, one tank was planned, but two more were added, making it three tanks firing from all sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. A total of 20 real tank shells were fired at the Lamborghini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

### Outcome
Despite initial hits to the pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a> and visible damage to the outer defenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>, the Lamborghini surprisingly survived with no holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. The stacked cars, while not strong enough to stop the rounds directly, successfully deflected them away from the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. One of the pools even caught a bullet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

## Roller Coaster with TNT

A "dangerous" roller coaster was set up with bombs on its ride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The theory was that a rider would be launched off the rail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Initially, mannequins were used to test the launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, with the coaster and mannequins landing relatively close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

Subsequently, dozens of pounds of TNT were placed inside the roller coaster cart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Upon detonation, the roller coaster was destroyed in a significant explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, though it did not fly as far as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Lamborghini vs. World's Largest Shredder

A Lamborghini was put into the world's largest shredder to test its durability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The shredder had previously destroyed items like pianos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>, vending machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>, and even a porta potty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. The Lamborghini was slowly pulled into the shredder, fighting back and even getting stuck for a moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. Ultimately, the car was completely shredded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

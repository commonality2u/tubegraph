Astronauts can earn an annual salary of $200,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. As part of a challenge to experience high-paying jobs, an individual underwent astronaut training with NASA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Lunar Rover Training
The first mission involved learning to drive the official lunar rover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This vehicle is designed for future use on the moon's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Operating the Rover
To drive the rover, the operator pushes a stick forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a> and twists it to turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Despite being designed for lunar exploration, the rover is street legal within the training facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

### Training Environment
Training included off-roading in NASA's lunar training yard, which features bumpy terrain and steep hills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Although the rover is equipped with seat belts, they are not typically used during these training exercises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

## NASA Space Facility
Following rover training, a tour of NASA's enormous space facility was conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This facility houses the second largest pool on Earth, used for various training simulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Space Suit Experience
A significant part of the training involved trying on a space suit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. It was revealed that astronauts must wear adult diapers during spacewalks, as they can be in the suit for up to 12 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The space suit artifact provided for the experience had flown on the space shuttle multiple times and had been worn by real astronauts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Lunar Artifacts
The final step of the training involved interacting with lunar artifacts, specifically the largest collection of moon rocks on display globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. While touching the "Genesis Rock" was not permitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, individuals were allowed to touch lunar soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. A sealed tube containing lunar dirt had not been opened since its return from the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, with a humorous acknowledgment that, in theory, it could contain an alien <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

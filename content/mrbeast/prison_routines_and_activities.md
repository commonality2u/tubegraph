The participants in this 50-hour prison simulation were subjected to daily routines and activities designed to mimic real incarceration, including strict schedules, limited amenities, and disciplinary measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Initial Intake and Living Conditions

Upon arrival, participants were ordered to put their hands against the wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> and were officially locked in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. They were informed they would be treated "exactly like inmates" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

The initial [[prison_food_and_living_conditions | living conditions]] observed included:
*   **Beds** The beds were described as "very uncomfortable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, feeling like a blanket laid in the middle of the road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Toilets** Toilets had a "yellow tint" and were considered "disgusting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Water Fountain** The water fountain was unhygienic, with visible "stuff" in the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Guard Interactions

[[interactions_with_guards_and_other_inmates | Interactions with guards]] included:
*   **Name Inquiries** Guards demanded inmates' last names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Verbal Harassment** Guards occasionally insulted inmates, such as calling them "ladies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Cuffing** Inmates were frequently cuffed when moving between areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## Daily Routine

The daily [[survival_strategies_and_making_a_routine | routine]] in the simulated prison involved:

### Nighttime Procedures
*   **Lights Out** Inmates were ordered to their bunks when lights went out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Middle-of-the-Night Roll Call** Guards conducted roll call around 3:00 a.m. to ensure no prisoners had escaped, waking everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Inmates were required to state their name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Morning Routine
*   **Wake-Up** Guards woke inmates with commands to "wake up ladies" and allowed five minutes to get out of bed, dress, and be ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Breakfast** The first prison meal was described as "not bad" but rated a "four out of 10" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Inmates were happy to be out of their cells for meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Personal Hygiene
*   **Showers** Inmates were allowed 10 minutes for showers, which had no hot water, making it feel like "torture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Jimmy experienced a "liberating" feeling after a hot shower later on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, noting how basic amenities like hot water can "change the course of your whole day" in prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Toothbrushes** Prisoners were given rudimentary finger toothbrushes due to past "stabbings with toothbrushes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

### Recreation Time (Rec Time)
Inmates were granted "rec time" in an area with a "crappy chessboard," a TV, and a "beautiful library" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Activities included playing poker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a> and gambling brownies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

*   **Outdoor Courtyard** Inmates were allowed time outside in a courtyard with an outdoor basketball court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Despite the rain, they played basketball against the guards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. The grass courtyard felt "very liberating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

### Prison Work
*   **Cleaning** Inmates were required to mop and clean the prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Kitchen Duty** Nolan and Jimmy were assigned kitchen duty, making food for everyone, which included "tons of beans" and cosmic brownies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## Disciplinary Actions and Incidents

*   **Riots and Flooding** Some inmates attempted to start a riot during rec time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, and later tried to flood the prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Punishment** Inmates who caused trouble were handcuffed and forced to clean while shackled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Good behavior was linked to good rec time, while bad behavior led to punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Cell Checks** Guards conducted cell checks to find contraband, leading to potential disciplinary action or [[solitary_confinement | solitary confinement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Nolan was sent to [[solitary_confinement | solitary confinement]] for possessing a knife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Nolan was later allowed out of [[solitary_confinement | solitary confinement]] to eat a meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Cell Disruption** After cell searches, mattresses were left flipped on their side, a measure intended to "make you feel like an animal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## Special Activities

*   **Wrestling** Inmates participated in wrestling matches as a form of entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, even wagering money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **[[prison_visitation_and_its_emotional_impact | Prison Visitation]]** Inmates were allowed to see family and friends through visitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Chris had an emotional visit with his son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Jimmy also arranged a visit with a lawyer who was unaware it was a simulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   **Escape Attempt** Nearing the end of the 50 hours, Nolan attempted to escape the prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a> but was quickly apprehended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

## Food Experience

*   **Bland Meals** [[prison_food_and_living_conditions | Prison food]] was generally described as "bland" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
*   **Last Meal** The final meal included "wieners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Despite it being a "last meal," participants expressed no desire to remain in the prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

The content creator frequently involves their subscriber base directly in challenges and giveaways, emphasizing the value of [[participant_incentives_and_offers | subscriber loyalty]] through various rewards.

## Inclusion in Challenges

Subscribers are often brought in and given the opportunity to win significant amounts of money through participation in unique challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This direct involvement acts as a powerful [[incentives_for_viewers_to_share_and_watch | incentive for viewers to share and watch]], as being a subscriber can lead to being chosen for future videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Rewarding Subscribed Viewers

Being a subscriber can directly influence the nature of the challenges and the value of [[moneybased_competitions_and_incentives | prizes]]:

*   **Tailored Challenges**
    A participant in a pull-up bar challenge was noted to be a subscriber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Later, a McDonald's employee, Orlando, was specifically chosen from a random McDonald's because he was a subscriber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The challenge for him (identifying a McDonald's burger) was intentionally made easy to ensure he would win money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. He then doubled his winnings through a simple "three steps forward" challenge, also because of his subscriber status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

*   **Bonus Rewards**
    Another contestant, Mr. Atlas, confirmed he was subscribed, and in addition to his winnings, he received an extra $1,000 as a direct thank you for being a subscriber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

*   **Watch History Rewards**
    One participant, Ben, was assessed based on his YouTube watch history of the creator's videos. For every video he had fully watched (indicated by a red progress bar), he received $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

    > "Every single MrBeast video you've watched, I will give you $100." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>

    Although he missed some videos, he still accumulated $600 from his watch history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.

## Impact on Participants

The direct engagement and rewarding of subscribers lead to emotional and thankful responses from participants. For instance, after winning a house, a subscriber expressed immense gratitude, stating he never would have dreamed of such a gift, and credited the creator and viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Similarly, Orlando, the McDonald's employee, expressed disbelief and excitement at being in a MrBeast video, as he watched all of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Mr. Atlas also highlighted the "huge blessing" the winnings were to his charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

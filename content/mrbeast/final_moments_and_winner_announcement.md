As the challenge to win a Lamborghini progressed, the contestants were significantly dwindled down, leading to the final intense moments. With only six participants remaining, the prize Lamborghini was raised two feet off the ground, with the capability to be lifted all the way to the ceiling, intensifying the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>.

## Escalating the Challenge
After several hours of no eliminations among the final participants, the rules were changed to make the challenge significantly harder: contestants now had to keep only a single finger on the Lamborghini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>. Most chose their pointer finger, while one contestant opted for their pinky finger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>.

## Contestants Taking Deals
The extreme physical and mental strain led to contestants making offers to exit the challenge with a prize:
*   One contestant proposed a deal for $20,000 and a MacBook, securing 4th place and walking away with the requested [[prize_distribution_and_surprise_outcomes | prize]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>.
*   Another contestant, in 3rd place, accepted $25,000 to help with student loans and replace broken phones for herself and her roommate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>.

## The Final Showdown
The competition then narrowed down to two remaining contestants: Fidias and another participant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>. To heighten the pressure for this [[final_showdown_and_musical_chairs | final showdown]], the Lamborghini was raised even higher, forcing them onto their tiptoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>. The host indicated that the one with the most determination would win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>.

The pain from keeping a single finger on the car became immense for one of the finalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>. After significant struggle, he eventually relented, taking his finger off the Lamborghini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>.

## Winner Announcement and Prize Distribution

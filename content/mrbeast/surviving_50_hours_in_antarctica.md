A group of individuals undertook a challenge to survive for 50 hours in Antarctica, located at the bottom of the globe and considered the coldest place on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Upon arrival, the plane departed, leaving them with no immediate way out for the duration of the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Initial Challenges and Camp Setup
Immediately upon landing, a blizzard began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, and the weather quickly deteriorated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The temperature was initially negative 30 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a> and dropped by an additional 20 degrees shortly after their arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The first priority was to trek towards nearby mountains for protection from the wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a> and set up a shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

The base camp was named "Camp Beast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. To secure the tents against the [[challenges_of_extreme_weather_in_antarctica | extreme weather]] and strong winds, snow blocks were cut to build a protective wall around the camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Daily Life in Antarctica
A unique aspect of Antarctica is that the sun never sets, making it difficult to determine when it is night or day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Food and Hygiene
Meals consisted of MREs (Meals, Ready-to-Eat), prepared by boiling water and pouring it into the food packets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

Due to the untouched nature of Antarctica, strict hygiene protocols were followed:
*   Urine had to be collected in bottles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   A separate "poop tent" was set up away from the main camp for defecation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Extreme Cold and Clothing
The cold was constant, with temperatures around negative 20 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Getting sick in Antarctica was particularly undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. To combat frostbite and the freezing conditions, multiple layers of clothing were necessary, including long pants, multiple jackets, a ski mask, and multiple pairs of gloves and goggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## The Mountain Climb
One significant challenge involved climbing an unnamed mountain. If successfully climbed, the group would have the privilege of naming it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. The journey to the mountain involved crossing a slippery "sea of ice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. The climb itself was described as terrifying due to steep drops and the risk of falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. After four and a half hours, the summit was reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. The mountain was subsequently named "Shopify Mountain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## The "Hole" Project
While the mountain climbing was underway, other members of the group engaged in digging a massive hole at base camp, which eventually reached a depth of eight feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This activity was considered "the best use of our time possible" by those involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

## Departure
On the final day, exhaustion was high, and the group faced the task of packing up their camp to ensure they didn't miss their flight out of Antarctica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. A crucial rule for preserving Antarctica's untouched beauty was to leave absolutely no trace of their presence behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. This included filling in the large hole they had dug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. The group successfully made it to the ice strip just before the plane landed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>, completing their 50-hour [[survival challenges | survival challenge]] in Antarctica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. ALE and EYOS were credited for making the trip possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

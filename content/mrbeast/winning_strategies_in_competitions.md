Competitions like the large-scale game of tag for a half-million-dollar prize demonstrate various [[winning_strategies | strategies]] and [[contestant_competition_strategies | tactics]] employed by both contestants and organizers to achieve their objectives.

## Contestant Strategies

### Hiding and Evasion
Initially, contestants prioritize finding the most remote and comfortable hiding spots within the vast stadium to evade being tagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. One contestant found comfort in a "V suite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, while another opted for an electrical box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Contestant Strategies

### Hiding and Evasion
Initially, contestants prioritize finding the most remote and comfortable hiding spots within the vast stadium to evade being tagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. One contestant found comfort in a "V suite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, while another opted for an electrical box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Alliances
Early in the game, some contestants formed alliances for mutual protection. An example of this is the "triangular formation" strategy used by Classy, Blakely, and another contestant to ensure no one was caught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This demonstrates [[decision_making_and_strategy_among_contestants | decision making and strategy among contestants]] through collaboration.

### Constant Movement
As the game progressed and the search intensified, contestants understood the importance of continuous movement to avoid being caught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. This proactive approach aims to counteract the taggers' ability to track their position.

### Resource Denial
In a [[creative_approaches_in_winning_prizes | creative approach]] to hinder the taggers, two contestants, including Airrack, intentionally flipped a golf cart to prevent the hosts from using it for pursuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This highlights [[strategies_in_highstakes_games | strategies in highstakes games]] where contestants think outside the box to gain an advantage.

### Attempted Vehicle Theft
In a desperate attempt to escape, one contestant tried to "steal a Lambo" by getting into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. However, this strategy was foiled by the car being locked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a> and the hosts removing the keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

## Tagger Strategies

### Increasing Personnel
When the vastness of the stadium made finding contestants difficult, additional taggers (Chris and Chandler, then SapNap and Carl) were brought in to expand the search effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Technological Advantage
To counter effective hiding, GPS trackers were activated on contestants' phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Despite a ten-second delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, this significantly aided in locating targets.

### Shrinking the Play Area
A critical strategic shift involved drastically reducing the playable area from the entire stadium to just the racetrack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. This transformed the game from "hide and seek" to "full on tag, no hiding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

### Coordinated Pursuit
Taggers employed coordinated pursuit [[strategies_and_tactics_used_by_contestants | strategies and tactics]] by flanking and cornering contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. They also adapted their focus, targeting slower runners for easier tags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

### Deception and Trap Setting
In the final stages, taggers used a deceptive strategy by having one person make noise to draw a contestant in one direction, while another hid to tag them when they ran the opposite way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. This resulted in a successful tag due to its clever execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

Gold panning is described as the lowest paying job discovered, with potential earnings as little as $1 a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Statistically, panners are not likely to make millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## The Process
Gold panners place dirt into a mechanism. Through enough shaking and the addition of water, the gold is filtered out and collects at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Challenges and Earnings
The process is not easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. After five hours of searching, the panner in the video did not become rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. A small gold nugget found was valued at just $0.02 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This demonstrates that one could pan for an entire year and only earn a dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

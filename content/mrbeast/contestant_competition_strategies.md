In a high-stakes laser obstacle course, ten contestants vie for a $250,000 prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The competition demands a combination of physical agility, mental fortitude, and [[winning_strategies_in_competitions | strategic thinking]] to navigate increasingly difficult laser mazes.

## Core Objective and Stakes

The primary objective for contestants is to survive the longest in a series of "laser obstacle" rooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Each room presents unique challenges, and touching any laser results in immediate elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The winner claims $250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The seriousness of the game and the money on the line heavily influence [[contestants_motivations_for_winning | contestants' motivations and decision-making]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Strategies by Level

Throughout the competition, [[contestant_strategies_and_dynamics | contestants employ various strategies]] and exhibit different approaches to problem-solving.

### Level 1: Initial Laser Maze

Described as the "simplest of all the rooms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, this level involves careful navigation to touch a money box. Contestants must be precise to avoid elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Level 2: Closing Walls

In this level, contestants must navigate a course and traverse a wall while red laser walls close in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. A suggested [[strategies_and_tactics_used_by_contestants | strategy]] is to "stay down the middle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, implying maintaining a central position to maximize space. Participants had to sprint through due to the closing walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, indicating a need for speed and quick [[decision_making_and_strategy_among_contestants | decision-making]]. One contestant reflected on being the "second one to jump in the pit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, suggesting an awareness of timing and available space relative to others.

### Level 3: Moving Platforms and Balance Beam

This timed level (10 minutes) requires contestants to move across moving platforms and a balance beam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   One contestant states, "I'm good right here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>, opting to wait for the platform to align, demonstrating patience.
*   A suggestion was made to "all go at the same time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, indicating consideration of group movement.

### Level 4: Giant Death Beams

Contestants must reach the other side, avoiding both red lasers and large blue "death lasers" that flash before firing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. The key [[eating_competition_strategy | strategy]] is to observe the flash of light preceding the death beam to time movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

### Level 5: Laser Prison (Endurance Test)

This [[unique_contest_formats | unique contest format]] traps contestants for up to 10 hours, with lasers turning off for only 3.5 seconds at a random point, requiring a quick sprint to touch the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   The primary [[winning_strategies_in_contests | strategy]] is endurance and staying alert. Contestants acknowledge the long wait time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>, discuss sleep deprivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, and the effect of prolonged standing on running speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
*   Upon the lasers turning off, they must react instantly and sprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. The shared success of all contestants in this level highlights collective alertness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a> and determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

### Level 7: Platform Jumping with Prime Hydration

Contestants must jump from platform to platform while holding a bottle of Prime Hydration, avoiding floor lasers that briefly disappear every 30 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   Some contestants choose to jump between platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.
*   One contestant waits for the lasers to disappear to use the floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>, demonstrating a "smart" and patient approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

### Level 7 (Re-entry): The Tesla Offer

With three contestants remaining, they are offered a choice: eliminate themselves for a guaranteed Tesla (approx. $40,000 value) or continue for a 33% chance at $250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.
*   All three opt to continue for the money, prioritizing the larger prize despite the risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. This highlights their high [[contestants_motivations_for_winning | motivation]] and "go big or go home" mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.

### Level 7 (Continued): Narrow Laser Path

This section involves navigating a very narrow laser path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
*   One contestant, Rain, takes her time and moves carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
*   Blake, contestant #4, develops an unexpected [[strategies_and_tactics_used_by_contestants | strategy]]: jumping over a laser wall and walking along the edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. This "breaks the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a> and demonstrates innovative problem-solving, though it carries the risk of falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

### Level 8: Friends' Lasers

This level has only three lasers, placed by the host's friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.
*   Blake, contestant #4, immediately sees a path and sprints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>, attributing his success to "zone[ing] in, block[ing] everything out and see[ing] the path and take off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. This is an aggressive, confident [[winning_strategies_in_competitions | strategy]].
*   Yei, contestant #6, takes a much slower, more deliberate approach, making it look "30 trillion times harder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>, but successfully avoids lasers. This highlights a contrast in [[contestants_decision_making | decision-making]] between speed and caution.

## The Final Level: All Mazes Combined

The final level combines elements from all previous mazes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. The rules are simplified: either be the first to touch the money, or win if the opponent touches a laser first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>. This creates a direct competitive dynamic.

### Final [[Contestant strategies and dynamics | Strategic Decisions]]

Given 30 seconds to strategize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>:
*   Yei (contestant #6) believes waiting for the opponent to make a mistake ("I'm just standing there. That is definitely the strat") is the best approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>.
*   Blake (contestant #4) decides to "play offense" and "send it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>, aiming to reach the money first rather than waiting for an error. He explicitly states, "I'm not waiting for him to mess up. I'm going to send it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.

Blake's aggressive strategy initially puts him ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>, but he ultimately touches a laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>, leading to Yei's victory. This outcome demonstrates that while an aggressive [[winning_strategies in competitions | strategy]] can be fast, caution and patience (even if unintentional) can lead to victory in an elimination-based challenge.

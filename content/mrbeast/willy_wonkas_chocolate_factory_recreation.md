This article details the real-life recreation of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory, which served as the setting for a series of challenges where one contestant could win the factory itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Ten contestants were chosen because they found golden tickets inside Feastable Bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

### The Chocolate Factory Environment
Upon entering, contestants expressed awe, describing the interior as "Candy Land" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Key features of the [[chocolate_factory_themed_games_and_activities | Chocolate Factory recreation]] included:
*   A chocolate river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> with a chocolate waterfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   A chocolate door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   A marshmallow area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, also referred to as the "Wollamhsram Room" (marshmallow spelled backward) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   Offices for factory management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   A giant candy cane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   A boat for traversing the chocolate river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

Eliminated contestants were sent to the chocolate river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, where a boat would take them away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### Challenges
The competition featured a series of challenges:

#### 1. Hide and Seek
Contestants were given a thousand seconds to hide within the factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

#### 2. Candy Wall of Death
This challenge involved climbing a tall "rock wall" covered in candy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The last person to reach the top was eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. A tie-breaker involved rock, paper, scissors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

#### 3. Chocolate Bar Speed Eating
Contestants paired up to eat Feastables chocolate bars as quickly as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Professional competitive eaters Matt Stonie and Joey Chestnut demonstrated the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. The last team to finish was eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

#### 4. Giant Mentos and Coke Drop
This challenge took place outside the factory with the world's largest bottle of Coke and the world's largest Mento <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Contestants had to drop the Mento into the Coke bottle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. The contestant who successfully made the shot had the power to eliminate one of the remaining five competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. The eliminated person received a solid gold Mentos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

#### 5. Spinning Peppermint Carousels
In a room covered with marshmallows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, contestants stood on spinning peppermint carousels, with the goal of being the last one remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. The carousels' speed was gradually increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

#### 6. Cake Toilet Elimination
Four toilets were presented, with three being real and one made entirely of cake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Contestants, blindfolded, chose a toilet, and the person who chose the cake toilet was eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Building the cake toilet took "forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

#### 7. Final Cooking Challenge with Gordon Ramsay
The final three contestants faced a cooking challenge, judged by Gordon Ramsay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. They had 45 minutes to create a dessert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, which Ramsay judged on looks and taste (scoring 1-10 for each) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. The contestant with the highest total score won the chocolate factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

### The Prize: The Chocolate Factory Deal
The winner of the competition received the deed to the Willy Wonka [[chocolate_factory_deal_and_business_decision | Chocolate Factory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

However, the factory was noted to have high maintenance costs, with the chocolate river deteriorating, candy going bad, and potentially millions of flies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. It was estimated to cost over a hundred thousand dollars a year to maintain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. The factory's creator offered to buy the factory back for half a million dollars in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. The winner accepted this offer, selling the factory for the cash prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

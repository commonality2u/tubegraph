The challenge of being buried alive for seven days under 20,000 pounds of dirt presents extreme physical and psychological demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article outlines the methods employed for survival and the precautions taken during this perilous feat.

## The Confinement: A Coffin-Like Shelter

The subject was confined within a coffin-like structure for the entire seven-day duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This "box" served as the sole personal space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Concerns regarding the structural integrity of the coffin, particularly its roof, were present from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The constant weight of the dirt caused the roof to shake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Essential Supplies

Survival depended on a limited cache of supplies:
*   **Food**
    *   A briefcase contained MREs (Meals Ready to Eat) and various snacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
    *   MREs are prepared by adding hot water, which chemically cooks the food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
    *   Despite initial provisions, food ran out before the seven-day mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Water**
    *   A five-gallon drum of water was provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Exercise Equipment**
    *   Three-pound dumbbells were included for physical activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## Health and Safety Protocols

Due to the extreme dangers involved in being buried alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, several critical precautions were implemented:
*   **Constant Monitoring**
    *   Personnel were required to watch the individual at all times to prevent suffocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
    *   A walkie-talkie was maintained for constant communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Medical Oversight**
    *   A doctor advised daily movement to prevent blood clots, a potentially fatal risk when lying down for extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
    *   Medics were on standby during the extraction process to check for nausea, dizziness, or other complications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.
*   **Structural Checks**
    *   An unscrewed bolt on the side of the coffin was discovered and addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   **Waste Management**
    *   For urination, initial "pee bottles" were provided, but later, empty meal bags were used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
    *   The individual attempted to hold bowel movements for the entire duration due to the difficulty and unpleasantness of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

## Psychological and Physical Challenges

The experience presented severe challenges:
*   **Fear and Discomfort**
    *   The experience was described as terrifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> and most people's worst fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
    *   Physical discomfort included numb feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> and back pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
    *   Vibrations from external activities caused headaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Mental Agony and Isolation**
    *   Sleeping was crucial to avoid thinking about being trapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
    *   Boredom led to repetitive actions like punching the coffin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
    *   Feelings of being constantly watched by cameras became irritating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
    *   By day five, the individual experienced crying spells without clear reason, lack of motivation, and a desire to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. The state progressed from terrified to "sad boy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.
*   **Hygiene**
    *   Smell became a significant issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
    *   Accidental urination on shorts led to them being cut shorter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

## External Interference and Communication

Despite the isolation, external interaction played a significant role:
*   **Communication**
    *   A walkie-talkie was the primary means of communication with those above ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **"Annoyance" Strategy**
    *   Friends intentionally disrupted sleep and caused irritation by drawing on the coffin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a> and playing loud music with 15 speakers placed on the grave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
    *   Simulated an earthquake with the speakers, causing the coffin to shake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Direct Observation**
    *   Friends used a surgical wire camera, fed through a vacuumed pipe, to observe the individual in the coffin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Tunnel Digging**
    *   Friends dug a tunnel to the coffin, using construction noises over speakers to mask their activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Internet Access**
    *   Verizon 5G Home Internet was hacked to provide wireless internet access underground, allowing real-time subscriber count viewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

## Extraction

The final phase involved careful extraction:
*   **Excavation**
    *   After seven days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>, an excavator was used to dig out the coffin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.
*   **Re-entry to Surface**
    *   Seeing sunlight after a week was an overwhelming experience, leading to renewed crying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
    *   Standing up for the first time in a week resulted in weak legs and a rush of blood to the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.

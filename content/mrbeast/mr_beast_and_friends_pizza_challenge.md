The challenge centered around eating the [[worlds_largest_pizza_slice | world's largest pizza slice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Each slice was six feet long and weighed nine pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, described as being equivalent to eating ten regular pizzas by oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The goal was for Mr. Beast's team to finish their slice before Joey Chestnut finished his <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Participants

*   **Joey Chestnut:** Recognized as the fastest competitive eater in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. He holds numerous world records, including the record for most world records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. He was described as a "freak of nature" and a "monster" due to his eating prowess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Before the challenge, Joey weighed 229 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   **Mr. Beast's Team:** Initially consisted of Mr. Beast, Chris, and Chandler, with a combined weight of 537 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. As the challenge progressed, additional helpers were brought in to assist the team: Tareq, Tyler, Jackson, and Dustin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. The team eventually grew to seven people competing against Joey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## The Challenge Progression

From the start, Joey Chestnut adopted a strategic eating method, cutting and folding his pizza to eat it quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. He also utilized water to help swallow the large quantities of food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Despite the numerical advantage, Mr. Beast's team struggled to keep pace, quickly feeling full and expressing discomfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Mr. Beast attempted to bribe Joey with $10,000 to stop for five minutes, but Joey refused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

Even with more people joining Mr. Beast's side, Joey maintained a significant lead, showing no signs of slowing down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. The challenge was deemed harder than counting to 100,000 by Mr. Beast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. A $100,000 incentive was offered to Mr. Beast's team if they could beat Joey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Outcome

Joey Chestnut successfully finished his entire nine-pound slice of pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. He weighed 250 pounds after the challenge, indicating he had gained 21 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Mr. Beast's team, despite adding ten pounds of pizza among them (bringing their combined weight to 547 pounds), lost the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

Joey expressed that it was one of the hardest challenges he had ever faced, but the addition of more opponents to Mr. Beast's team motivated him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Mr. Beast presented Joey with a pizza-shaped trophy to commemorate his victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

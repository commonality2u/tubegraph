In the entertaining world of trick shots, the video entitled *Doh Work!* showcases a thrilling set of challenges where participants are offered [[high_stakes_cash_prize_challenges | unexpected opportunities]] to win staggering cash prizes. Hosted by Jimmy, this video takes viewers through a series of innovative scenarios, each presenting a unique way to earn substantial financial rewards.

## Building the Prize Pool

The concept of the video is as thrilling as the shots themselves: every time a contestant misses a shot, $10,000 is added to the prize pool. This dynamic continuously raises the stakes, creating opportunities for future participants to win even more as the video progresses. At the beginning, we see a missed basketball shot from atop a 250-foot bridge, which immediately adds to the prize pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

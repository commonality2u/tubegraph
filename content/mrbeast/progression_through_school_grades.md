In a lighthearted and competitive challenge, MrBeast and his crew embark on a [[mrbeast_challenge_concepts | whimsical journey]] through the American school system, starting from first grade and attempting to make it to twelfth grade. The aim is to test their knowledge, reminisce about school days, and humorously relive the anxiety and excitement associated with progressing through school grades.

## First Grade: The Beginning

The adventure kicks off with the crew entering first grade, where they introduce themselves with interesting facts. Miss Whitford, the teacher, sets the tone for the challenge by announcing a test that will determine if they can proceed to the next grade. With 10 questions to answer in 10 minutes, they put aside calculators and take on the challenge earnestly. Fortunately, everyone passes the first grade successfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Second Grade: Challenges Begin

The second-grade tasks begin with math problems and tasks that demand showing one's workâ€”a common school requirement. A few crew members, including Chandler, find themselves struggling, resulting in Chandler's failure due to his overconfidence and failure to show his work properly. He humorously accepts his defeat with water balloon consequences [[humorous_and_unusual_punishments | water balloon consequences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Third to Fifth Grade: Steady Progress

The crew quickly advances through third grade with a focus on multiplication and properties, followed by a fourth-grade test involving state knowledge and simple fractions, both of which they pass. Fifth-grade challenges introduce elements of history and more complex math problems, which some crew members find tricky. Despite the hurdles, several members pass and advance further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## Middle School: Sixth to Eighth Grade

Sixth-grade topics introduce language arts and science, focusing on planetary knowledge, which is navigated successfully by several participants. Moving into seventh grade, American history makes its debut with questions on colonization and vocabulary, where spelling challenges prove to be a downfall for some. Jimmy ends his journey here due to a spelling mishap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

In eighth grade, the focus shifts to understanding amendments and mathematical operations, testing the crew's ability to retain basic social studies and math knowledge. The transition from middle school to high school is completed with success for a few <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

## High School: Ninth to Twelfth Grade

The high school phase represents the final [[challenge_formats_and_rules_in_competitions | challenge]], introducing geography and government subjects. Participants tackle questions about states bordering Mexico and the location of Mount Rushmore, and work through US government basics. Chris fails just shy of completing the eleventh grade due to the challenging material, but Bailey manages to make it to the final grade [[prize_money_and_decisionmaking | final grade]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

## Twelfth Grade: The Culmination

In the end, Bailey is left standing, tasked with tackling twelfth-grade questions to claim the $10,000 prize. Faced with questions about democracy, government, and more advanced mathematics, Bailey successfully completes the test, thus winning the challenge. His prize aims to ease real-world educational expenses, showing a humorous yet thoughtful conclusion to this educational parody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.

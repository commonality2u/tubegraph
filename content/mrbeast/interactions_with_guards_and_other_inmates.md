Upon arrival at the prison, the inmates were immediately instructed by guards to put their hands against the wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. They were informed they would be treated exactly like real inmates, including eating [[prison_food_and_living_conditions | real prison food]], cleaning the prison, and being subjected to the "mental warfare" of imprisonment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Daily Routines and Rules

Guards enforced a strict regimen, including:
*   **Roll Call** Guards conducted roll calls in the middle of the night to ensure no prisoners had escaped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Inmates were required to state their names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Waking Up** In the mornings, guards woke inmates, giving them five minutes to get out of bed and dress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Movement** Inmates were often cuffed when moving between areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a> and instructed to face the wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Showers** Inmates were given 10 minutes for showers, provided with a towel, underwear, shirt, and soap, but had no hot water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Toothbrushes were small, finger-held devices, due to past incidents of "stabbings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Recreation Time** Guards announced "Rec time!" to gather inmates for recreational activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Conflicts and Discipline

The prison environment led to various conflicts and disciplinary actions:
*   **Provocation** During a last name check, an inmate joked about "Imagine dragon theses nuts" to a guard, who responded with a threat, "I'll be back for you guys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Inmates dared guards to come get them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Riot Attempt** While some inmates were playing cards during recreation time, others got jealous and tried to start a riot, complaining about favoritism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Property Damage** Inmates tried to flood the prison, resulting in them being cuffed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Punishment** As punishment for their behavior, the disruptive inmates were forced to mop the floor while in shackles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. A guard stated, "Good behavior leads to good rec time. Bad behavior leads to this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This led to some inmates being excluded from recreation time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Contraband and [[solitary_confinement_challenges | Solitary Confinement]]** During a cell check for contraband, Nolan was found with a knife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a> and was sent to [[solitary_confinement_challenges | solitary confinement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Nolan's screaming could be heard by other inmates from his [[solitary_confinement_challenges | solitary confinement]] cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. He was eventually allowed out for a meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Escape Attempt** Near the end of the 50 hours, Nolan attempted to escape the prison, but was quickly apprehended by guards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Even with only three hours remaining, he was returned to [[solitary_confinement_challenges | solitary confinement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

## Inmate Dynamics and Activities

Despite the harsh environment, inmates engaged in various interactions and activities:
*   **Banter and Camaraderie** Inmates engaged in lighthearted banter, such as discussing uncomfortable beds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, disgusting toilets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, and problematic water fountains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. They also shared jokes about dropping soap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Shared [[prison_food_and_living_conditions | Meals]]** Inmates ate together in a common area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. They were occasionally assigned kitchen duty, preparing food for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Meals were described as "very bland" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **Recreational Activities** During recreation time, inmates could play chess, watch TV, or read books from a library <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. They also played poker, gambling for cosmic brownies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Outdoor Time** Inmates were granted time outside in a courtyard with a basketball court, which felt very "liberating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. They played basketball against the guards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a> and soccer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Physical [[interpersonal_dynamics_in_confined_spaces | Confrontations]]** Some inmates engaged in wrestling matches, viewing it as a typical prisoner activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   **[[Prison visitation and its emotional impact | Visitation]]** Inmates received [[Prison visitation and its emotional impact | visits]] from family and friends through a glass partition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. One inmate even paid a lawyer to visit him, though the lawyer was confused by the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

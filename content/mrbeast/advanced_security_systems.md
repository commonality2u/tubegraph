A security system described as "the most advanced in the world" was deployed to protect a $100,000 diamond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, challenging participants to steal it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The system incorporates several challenging stages designed to test agility, precision, and strategic thinking.

## System Components and Challenges

The core of the security system relies on a multi-layered approach, primarily featuring:

*   **Laser Grids** The most prominent feature involves intricate laser grids that participants must navigate without touching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Touching a laser results in losing a "life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
    *   **Varying Complexity** Early stages feature simpler laser patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. More advanced stages introduce multiple laser colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, dynamically changing heights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, and lasers that appear and disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Some stages also include flickering lights to increase difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
    *   **Precision Detection** The system precisely detects contact, with footage being reviewed to confirm if any part of a participant's body, such as the head or elbow, touched a laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   **Physical Obstacles** In addition to lasers, the system includes physical challenges that require athletic prowess.
    *   **Jumping Course** Participants must jump through a course onto padding, with penalties for hitting the top of the obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
    *   **Balance Beam** A wobbly balance beam requires careful navigation without falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
    *   **Stool Traversal** The final stage involves moving across a room using only two stools, without touching the floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

## Dynamic Elements and Surprises

The security system incorporates surprises and dynamic changes to keep participants "on their toes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>:
*   Extra lives are strategically placed as hidden elements in different stages, often near the diamond or in surprising locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   The diamond's location can be altered, with the host sometimes placing it in unexpected spots to test observation skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   Rules are introduced or modified mid-challenge, such as having to complete a stage on one leg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a> or being handcuffed to another participant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## System Design and Intent

The courses are designed to be progressively harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>, with one stage even being chosen by LazarBeam for its difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. While the initial diamond is a prop, the real $100,000 diamond is held by the host and awarded upon successful completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. This system tests not only physical ability but also mental strategy under pressure.

To celebrate hitting 100 million subscribers, a private island was purchased to be given away to one subscriber who could win a series of [[High Stakes Challenges | extreme challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. One hundred subscribers were brought together to compete in four challenges, with the last person standing winning the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Challenge 1: Fire Starting
The first challenge was to start a fire and light a torch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The first 50 people to successfully do so would move on to the next stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This task proved difficult, with participants struggling to light their fires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Although an estimate predicted it would take participants 20 minutes on average to start a fire, some finished in about one minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. After this challenge, 50 people were eliminated, losing their chance to win the private island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Challenge 2: Red Light, Green Light
The second challenge was a recreation of the "Red Light, Green Light" game from *Squid Game*, set in the middle of the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Unlike the previous *Squid Game* video, there was no time limit for this challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Only the first 20 contestants to step on or cross the red line would advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. A twist was introduced where specific phrases from the host would signal "green light" or "red light," leading to a contestant technically finishing early by understanding the rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. After this round, contestants who didn't make it were given $3,000 as a thank you for participating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Elimination by Earliest Subscriber
With 20 contestants remaining, only 10 seats were available on the raft to the next challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. The earliest subscriber among the remaining 20 was given a competitive edge: the power to eliminate half of the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This subscriber, Gabbie, had to choose 10 contestants to be eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## Challenge 3: Plank Drop
The 10 remaining contestants were brought to a pirate ship for the next challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This challenge involved 10 planks, each with a rope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. When a rope was cut, five of the planks would drop the contestant into the water, while five would remain stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Contestants chose their planks, and their fate was determined by whether their plank dropped or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. The first four people surprisingly picked safe planks despite the odds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Eventually, the five winners were decided through a combination of initial luck and subsequent random cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## Pre-Final Offer: $50,000 Buyout
Before the final challenge, the five remaining contestants were each offered a check for $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. They had to choose whether to keep the money and leave or burn the check and continue competing for the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. All five contestants chose to burn the $50,000 checks, opting to continue for a chance at the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

## Final Challenge: Hide and Seek for the Deed
The final challenge was a hide-and-seek game for the deed to the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. The 100 million subscriber play button, with the island's deed taped to its back, was hidden on the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. The contestants were blindfolded while the play button was hidden nearby, despite a misleading long drive to suggest it was far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. The first person to find the play button would win the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

One contestant ultimately found the play button, securing the win and the private island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. The winner expressed disbelief, calling it the "craziest video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

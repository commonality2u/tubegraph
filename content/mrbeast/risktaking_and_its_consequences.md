In a series of [[high_stakes_challenges | high-stakes challenges]], contestant Mack faced numerous opportunities to win significant sums of money, but each victory came with the immediate [[risk_versus_reward_challenges | risk of losing everything]] for a chance at an even larger prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The ultimate goal was to win $1,000,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Progressive Winnings and Increasing Stakes

The challenges began with a straightforward task: escape a closing cage before being crushed by spikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Upon successfully earning $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, Mack was immediately presented with the choice to risk it all for $200,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Despite the host's admission that there would be no video if he declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, Mack accepted the risk, expressing confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

The challenges became progressively harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>:
*   **Trap 2: Laser Grid** – Navigate a room filled with lasers without touching any, or lose $200,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Mack successfully completed this challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Trap 3: Boulder Chase** – Grab $100,000 and outrun a massive rolling boulder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Mack narrowly escaped this "Indiana Jones" inspired trap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Trap 4: Life-Sized Video Game** – Navigate a parkour course in a giant ball within 5 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Despite initial struggles, Mack "obliterated" the final stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, increasing his winnings to $400,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Trap 5: Underwater Lock Picking** – Swim through an underwater chamber, picking four locks with a clothes hanger before the money is pulled into a bonfire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Mack successfully completed this challenge, securing $500,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Trap 6: "Easiest Trap"** – Choose between a Feastables Bar or a Hershey's bar, with the chosen one going into the trash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. Mack chose to trash the Hershey's bar, winning $600,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. This was presented as a strategically easy trap to encourage continued participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
*   **Trap 7: High-Altitude Balance Beam** – Walk across an "absurdly thin balance beam" 200 feet in the air, facing his biggest fear of heights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Mack successfully completed this challenge, winning $700,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

## The Final Risk and its Consequences

With $700,000 won, Mack deliberated, acknowledging the "insane amount of money" but feeling "so close" to the million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. He opted for "just one more" challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.

**Trap 8: Squid Game Honeycomb Challenge** – This challenge combined elements of Squid Game, requiring Mack to cut out intricate shapes from honeycomb cookies and place them on a scanner without breaking them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. Breaking a cookie would result in losing everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

Initially, there was no time limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, allowing Mack to use a strategy of licking the honeycomb to melt sugar and poke a needle through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. He successfully completed the first two shapes (circle and triangle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

However, for the final, hardest shape (umbrella), a 10-minute timer was introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>, putting Mack under immense [[decision_making_under_pressure | pressure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. He attempted to use a stack of money as a hammer, a strategy not seen in Squid Game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. With only 60 seconds remaining, the cookie broke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>, resulting in him losing all $700,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

[!WARNING]
"I'm such an idiot, dude. And I had it all. It's $700,000. I don't know why I did this." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>

The experience was described as "pretty sad" by the host <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>, who ultimately gave Mack an extra $100,000 for his troubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

[!INFO]
The host advised, "If you're in a MrBeast video... quit while you're ahead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>, summarizing the [[consequences_of_playful_punishments_in_challenges | inherent risk]] of continuously pushing for higher rewards.

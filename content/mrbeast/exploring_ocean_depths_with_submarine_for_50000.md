For a cost of $50,000, participants had the opportunity to explore the depths of the ocean in a submarine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This adventure was part of a series of experiences ranging in cost from $1 to half a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The $50,000 Experience

The journey began with the participants arriving on a yacht, which was described as beautiful and pretty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. From there, they transitioned to a submarine for the expedition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

Inside the submarine, they immediately observed fish, including a barracuda, even before descending into the deeper parts of the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The group had the entire submarine to themselves, allowing them full control over their exploration, with the only restriction being that they were not allowed to crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. To capture the best angles during the underwater exploration, scuba divers were paid to follow the submarine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## Comparison with a Safari

During the submarine expedition, a parallel $50,000 safari was taking place in Africa, where other team members (Tareq and Nolan) sought to find various creatures, including a lion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. While the safari encountered animals like a warthog, zebras, and elephants that charged them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, the submarine team maintained that their underwater experience of seeing fish was superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. However, one participant later admitted that the safari was "way cooler than a submarine" and they'd "rather see this than a fish," citing their heart beating out of their chest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

## Conclusion of the Experience

The $50,000 deep-sea exploration was considered significant, though it "pales in comparison to the [[simulating_space_travel_for_250000 | $250,000 zero gravity experience]]" that followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

A group of individuals undertook a [[24_hour_mountain_challenge | 24-hour challenge]], aiming to spend a full day atop one of America's tallest mountains, over 6,000 feet in the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## The Ascent

Before the [[24_hour_mountain_challenge | 24-hour challenge]] could begin, the team first had to [[adventurous_climb_and_naming_a_mountain | climb the mountain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. They started on the Grandfather Trail, marked by a blue diamond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The climb involved navigating up rocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> and encountering frightening sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

### [[hiking_difficulties_and_challenges | Hiking Difficulties and Challenges]]

The journey presented several [[hiking_difficulties_and_challenges | challenges]]:
*   **Navigation Issues**: The team initially took a wrong turn, requiring them to turn back from a deep drop-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Physical Strain**: One participant struggled with bad equilibrium, making climbing difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, while another felt their legs after just an hour, despite claiming three hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Terrain**: The mountain was unexpectedly rocky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, and the path included numerous ladders, some feeling precarious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Fear of Heights**: One member admitted to being afraid of heights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> and expressed terror during the ascent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Oxygen Thinning**: As they ascended over 6,000 feet, the air became incredibly thin, sometimes requiring deep breaths to avoid lightheadedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Separate Peaks**: Upon reaching what they thought was the top, they realized they had to descend and climb *another* mountain with a steep slope for their campsite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, making the total hike about four hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## [[setting_up_camp_and_creating_shelter | Setting up camp and Creating Shelter]]

After hiking for over three hours, the team decided to [[setting_up_camp_and_creating_shelter | set up camp]] directly on the peak of the mountain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The climate at 6,000 feet could reach as low as 45 degrees Fahrenheit, and there was a risk of bear attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

The process of [[setting_up_camp_and_creating_shelter | setting up camp]] was not straightforward for all:
*   One member, Chandler, admitted he didn't know how to set up a tent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a> and had difficulty operating a grill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   Another participant shared a tent to avoid setting up their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

## Food and Water

The group faced immediate challenges with supplies:
*   **Water Scarcity**: They quickly realized they had consumed most of their water during the ascent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. A "special ops team" was dispatched to a spring located a mile away to retrieve water, which would need to be boiled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. The spring was a "black forest pipe" with clean-tasting water, though concerns about dysentery were raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Improvised Cooking**: While the water team was out, others attempted to set up a grill to cook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. They struggled to light a fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a> and later had to forage for food, finding SpaghettiOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. They boiled the SpaghettiOs over the fire, using a sock to handle the hot can <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

### Unexpected Pizza Delivery

Despite being on a remote mountain peak, a pizza delivery person attempted to deliver a Domino's pizza that had been ordered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. The delivery person hiked for six hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>, expressing disbelief that someone would order pizza on a camping trip when s'mores were an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. The pizza arrived after dark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>, having been dropped multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, but was still considered good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

## Night on the Mountain

As night fell, the team faced new challenges:
*   **Darkness**: With no flashlights, getting back to camp before dark was critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>, especially for those returning with water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   **Fog**: A "fog of death" rolled in as it got dark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
*   **Cold**: Temperatures were expected to drop to 45 degrees Fahrenheit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>, and the morning was "cold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.
*   **Wildlife Concerns**: The risk of bear attacks was present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>, though no bears were encountered overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

## Morning and Descent

After surviving the night, the group awoke to discover they had very limited water and were completely out of food, with only a few granola bars, beef jerky, and a Snickers bar left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Due to the lack of supplies, they decided to descend the mountain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

## [[responsible_hiking_practices | Responsible Hiking Practices]]

Reflecting on the experience, the participants encouraged others to try hiking but emphasized [[responsible_hiking_practices | responsible practices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>:
*   Stay on designated trails and follow all regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.
*   Never damage or deface vegetation, rocks, or any natural resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.
*   Stay clear of all wildlife and never feed them, as it affects their natural actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.
*   Recognize that every action has an impact on the land and strive to make those impacts positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

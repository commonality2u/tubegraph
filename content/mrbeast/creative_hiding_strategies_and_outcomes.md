In a large-scale hide-and-seek challenge held in one of the world's largest malls, 100 subscribers were each given $10,000 and locked inside for 10 hours while hunters attempted to find them and reclaim the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Participants employed various [[hide_and_seek_strategies | hiding strategies]] in an attempt to retain their prize.

## Hiding Spot Attempts and Outcomes

Contestants utilized the vastness of the mall to find diverse hiding spots:

*   **Lego Land** One participant was spotted in Lego Land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, but the outcome of this specific search is not detailed.
*   **Behind Curtains** In Toys R Us, individuals attempted to hide behind curtains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This strategy was unsuccessful, as hunters quickly discovered them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Vending Machine/Ceiling Access** One contestant moved a vending machine to reveal a ladder leading into the ceiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The hunter acknowledged that climbing into the ceiling would make them deserving of the prize, but the outcome of this specific attempt is not shown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Building a Fort** A contestant created a small fort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. While recognized as a "genuinely good idea," the individual was still found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Stuffed Animal Camouflage** Some participants tried to hide or sleep amongst large stuffed animals, with one noted to be oddly stretched out like a human under a zebra blanket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. These individuals were found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Under Stairs and Mats** During a search conducted by a SWAT team, individuals were located under stairs by an exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a> and behind brown mats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **Prolonged Hiding** One person was found after hiding for approximately five hours in a remote area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   **Under the Stage** A contestant successfully hid under a stage, believing it would secure them for the remainder of the night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. The seeker later thought they saw someone there, indicating its effectiveness for a time, but the contestant managed to evade capture then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Inside Display Boxes/Shelves** One participant attempted to hide inside an It'Sugar box on a shelf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. This tactic was unsuccessful, and they were discovered.

## Advanced Search Methods and Hunter [[creative_elimination_tactics | Tactics]]

As the challenge progressed, hunters employed more sophisticated methods:

*   **SWAT Team Deployment** A SWAT team was brought in to assist in the search, specifically targeting a large theme park area within the mall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This team used thermal drones for scanning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, quickly finding multiple hidden individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Despite the drone, one participant managed to remain undiscovered by the SWAT team in the theme park area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Jack Black's Announcement** To flush out contestants, an announcement by Jack Black was played over the mall's speakers, informing participants that the water park area was closing, forcing those hiding there to relocate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **"Mom's Boat" Motivation** As hunter motivation waned, the lead hunter offered to buy boats for the team members' mothers if they reduced the remaining contestants to under 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. This incentive proved effective, significantly increasing the number of people found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Disguise and Distraction** One hunter, Nolan, disguised himself as an old janitor, complete with a cart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This [[strategic_disguises_and_getaways | strategic disguise]] allowed him to move around unnoticed and engage with contestants, leading to discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. He also used distraction, pretending to look for shirts with another hunter while actually searching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
*   **Public Opening** In the final 30 minutes, the mall opened to the public, adding another layer of [[challenges_and_hiding_strategies | challenge]] for the remaining contestants who had to avoid being found amongst regular shoppers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

## Outcomes

Many contestants were discovered using various [[strategies_and_hiding_spots_in_large_areas | search strategies]], with over 70 individuals found by the time the "mom's boat" goal was met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Despite the intense search efforts, a significant number of participants successfully evaded capture until the 10-hour timer expired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. The individuals who survived the full duration were each awarded $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. The total prize money disbursed was approximately $500,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

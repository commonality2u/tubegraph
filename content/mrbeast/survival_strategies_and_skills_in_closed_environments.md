In today's rapidly evolving world, various scenarios may require individuals to survive in closed environments, such as during extended isolation in a bunker. The challenge of living in such limited spaces for prolonged periods can be daunting. In one compelling social experiment, two individuals, Hugo and Rayne, were tasked to survive [[100day_survival_challenge | 100 days]] in a nuclear bunker to win a cash prize of $500,000. This unique situation provides valuable insights into the survival strategies and skills needed in closed environments.

## The Environment and Setup

The two participants, Hugo and Rayne, were introduced to each other for the first time upon entering the bunker, which was equipped with all necessary supplies to last them the full duration of the challenge, including food, water, and even the capability to grow their own vegetables. The bunker, situated 40 feet underground, served as their home for 100 days. It featured essential amenities like beds and a kitchen area.

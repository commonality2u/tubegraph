## Monkey Island: A $1 Million Habitat

The $1 million "Monkey Island" is literally swarmed with hundreds of monkeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. These monkeys employ a strategy of appearing friendly before attempting to steal food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, even grabbing GoPros and hats from visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. Luxury cabanas on the island are designed to house both human guests and monkeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. Visitors can even experience unique activities like getting a massage alongside a monkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

## $150 Million Island: A Sanctuary for Endangered Species

This $150 million island is home to some of the most exotic animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>. Visitors quickly become distracted by creatures such as turtles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. The island features numerous flamingos that are present everywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a> and can be fed by guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>. A large tortoise, referred to as a "dinosaur," also resides on the island and could theoretically live for over 200 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>. Lemurs are also present and known to swarm visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>.

Most of these exotic animals are endangered species brought to the island by its owner, Richard Branson, as part of an effort to prevent their extinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>.

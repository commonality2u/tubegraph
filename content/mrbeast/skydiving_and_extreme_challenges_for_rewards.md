Challenges involving the strategic placement of items within a defined triangle, often for significant financial rewards, are a recurring theme. The fundamental rule across these [[high_stakes_challenges | high stakes challenges]] is that if any item touches the boundary line of the designated triangle, the participant loses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. These [[risk_versus_reward_challenges | risk versus reward challenges]] can involve various settings and prize types.

## "Fit in the Triangle" Challenges

Participants are tasked with fitting as many items as possible within a large red triangle, with MrBeast pledging to pay for everything successfully contained.

### High-Value Item Stacking
One challenge involved Adam attempting to fit multiple large screen TVs within a triangle. He began with one TV, then ambitiously added a second, creating a double table structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This required careful maneuvering and stacking, with the risk of touching the red line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Ultimately, Adam successfully fit over $23,000 worth of items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Retail Store Challenges
The concept was expanded to include entire retail stores.
*   **Sam's Club for Charity**
    Darren, who runs a food pantry, was given a large triangle in a Sam's Club to fill with food items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Despite the vast space, he managed to fill a significant amount, resulting in $82,058 worth of food to donate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. This donation enabled the expansion of the food pantry's services to another community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.
*   **GameStop Inventory Packing**
    Contestants attempted to fit the entire inventory of a GameStop store into a triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This [[creative_stunts_and_highrisk_video_challenges | creative stunt]] required precise measurement and strategic stacking of boxes and items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. One participant, Zealous, was disqualified early for touching the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Later, two participants, Patrick and Dave, successfully fit the entire store's contents, winning the GameStop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Car Dealership Challenge**
    At a car dealership, Shirley was challenged to fit as many cars as possible into a triangle. Special boards were used to guide the cars over the line without touching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Shirley successfully placed five cars in the triangle, valuing over $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. She was initially surprised to learn she won all five cars, leading to an emotional reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

### Pay-It-Back Challenge
In a twist, Chris and Chandler participated in a challenge where they had to fill a triangle, but the other person would pay for the items. Chandler's items cost Chris $6,574.45 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>, while Chris's items cost Chandler $4,558.18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

### Charity Challenge
A hospital worker named Heather filled a triangle with toys and PlayStation 5s to be donated to a local children's hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

### Karl's Room Challenge
As a consequence for a previous mistake in GameStop, Karl's possessions were subjected to a challenge. Zealous was allowed to take anything from Karl's room that fit into an oval drawn on the floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. Karl's items, including PS5s and a mini-fridge, were "taken," but MrBeast promised to buy him replicas, effectively meaning Karl didn't lose anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

## Skydiving into a Triangle
This [[highstakes_physical_challenges | highstakes physical challenge]] involved Dino attempting to skydive from thousands of feet in the air and land within a red triangle on the ground to win $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Tareq, despite being afraid of heights, also jumped for an additional $20,000 reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Dino successfully landed in the triangle, and Tareq's jump resulted in a total win of $40,000 for Dino <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This illustrates [[incentives_and_motivations_in_challenges | incentives and motivations in challenges]] that push individuals to overcome personal fears.

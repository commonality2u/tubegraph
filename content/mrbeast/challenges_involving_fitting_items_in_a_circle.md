Throughout various competitions, individuals are presented with a unique [[challenges_and_eliminations_in_a_largescale_competition | challenge]]: to fit as many purchased or selected items as possible within a designated circular (or similarly shaped) area to win them for free. The rules often stipulate that no part of the item can extend beyond or touch the boundary of the shape, creating a test of spatial reasoning and careful stacking.

## Notable Challenges

### Chandler's First Attempt
In an early iteration of the [[challenges_involving_fitting_items_in_a_space | challenge]], Chandler was tasked with fitting various electronics into a red-taped circle. He began with two PlayStations and considered adding a T-Rex figurine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. A key rule was that nothing could touch the red tape marking the circle's boundary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. He successfully stacked the PlayStations vertically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, added Nintendo Switches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, a TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, and even a waffle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, managing to get everything inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Tyler's Square Deal
Tyler faced a similar [[challenges_involving_fitting_items_in_a_space | challenge]] where items needed to fit into a hidden square, initially disguised by a table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. He chose items such as a $280 anime statue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a> and a large, intricate shield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, accumulating an estimated $10,000 worth of goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The revelation of a square rather than a circle added to the suspense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Tyler was allowed to go over the red tape as long as items didn't touch the ground outside the square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, successfully fitting everything despite initial doubts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Helping the Soup Kitchen
A significant [[prize_challenge_in_a_rented_mall | challenge]] was presented to the manager and treasurer of a soup kitchen. They were given a very large, well-hidden circle in a grocery store, with the goal of filling it with food to feed their 35,000 meals-a-year operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. They utilized a power jack to move entire pallets of water bottles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a> and loaded many carts with groceries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The circle magically extended to accommodate all items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, and they also received a $20,000 check for their soup kitchen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

### Chandler's Pizza Slice Challenge
Chandler faced another [[challenges_involving_fitting_items_in_a_space | challenge]] with a smaller, trickier shape: a "pizza slice" triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. He had to fit high-value items including $1,000 shoes, a $250 teddy bear, a $400 statue, a $30 brick, a $2,000 Louis Vuitton bag, and a $1,000 wall item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. His strategy involved stuffing items into the expensive bag and placing it on a small wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. However, he was tackled and lost the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, learning that Chris had intentionally drawn the difficult shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

### Furnishing a Home After a Flood
John, whose house was affected by floods, was given the opportunity to refurnish his home by fitting items into a large circle at a furniture store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. He selected a bed, two lamps, a dining room set, and a $3,000 bedroom set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. The circle was nearly full, but he managed to fit a final sofa by ensuring its wheels remained within the boundary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, resulting in almost $30,000 worth of furniture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

### The Wilkerson Family's Generosity
The Wilkerson family, in need of assistance, were presented with a pentagon-shaped area at a general store. They filled 11 carts with items like a leg massager, $100 toothbrushes, and a Ninja blender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. The area was extended as needed to accommodate their selections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Ultimately, they successfully fit 13 full carts of items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a> and were also given a $10,000 check to help with hospital bills and to buy a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

### Supporting People with Learning Disabilities
Dara, who works with individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, participated in a challenge to acquire essential items for their independence. She chose tablets (important for non-verbal communication) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>, electric toothbrushes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, and Fitbits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Despite the initial circle being small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>, she successfully fit all items into the designated area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>, which would significantly impact the lives of those she supports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.

### Baseball Coach's Gear Acquisition
A middle school baseball coach participated in a challenge to win equipment for his team. He selected a new catcher's mitt, cleats for his players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>, a helmet, and two bats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. Despite a close call with one item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>, he successfully fit all the baseball gear into the circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>, surprising his team with the winnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.

### Electronics and Baby Supplies Challenges
Other instances of the [[challenges_involving_fitting_items_in_a_space | challenge]] included:
*   **Electronics:** A woman attempted to fit a $400 hair dryer, an Xbox, and a hoverboard into a circle. She successfully stacked her final items, including the hoverboard, on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.
*   **Baby Supplies:** Chris, expecting a baby, participated in a challenge to get items for his child, Tucker. He chose clothes and a car seat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. Despite the circle not being as big as anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>, all items were successfully placed inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.

### Stacking Cash
A different variant of the [[challenges_involving_carrying_cash | challenge]] involved stacking money in a square. Participants could keep as much money as they could stack before it fell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. One participant managed to stack $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

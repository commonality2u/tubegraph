In a challenge where 100 kids compete against 100 adults for a $500,000 prize, the participants' [[decision_making_and_strategy_among_contestants|decisions]] and [[strategies_and_tactics_used_by_contestants|tactics]] are crucial throughout the 100-hour competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Only the remaining players on the winning team split the prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, leading to various individual and [[team_dynamics_and_strategies|group dynamics]].

## Early Departures and Incentives

Within the first hour of the challenge, Mr. Beast offers $1,000 to anyone who decides to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This is presented as the only way to receive money unless a participant wins the overall challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Kids' Reactions**: Some kids immediately dismiss the offer, stating, "A thousand dollars is not enough money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. However, others choose to leave, with one exclaiming, "I'm going to leave for a thousand dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Adults' Reactions**: An adult expresses a willingness to share if their team wins, remarking, "I'm a giver, so I I'll share a little bit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Initial Outcome**: In just one hour, 12 adults and 10 kids are eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, causing some remaining participants to express confusion or dismay at the number of people who left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Environmental Adaptations and Rules

As boredom sets in, participants begin to adapt to their environment.
*   **Kids' Ingenuity**: After five hours, the kids discover they can remove floor tiles, deciding to "All of them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This act of disassembling their space indicates a response to boredom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Information Gathering**: One child attempts to look into the adults' cube to ascertain their numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, a move quickly thwarted by Nolan, who classifies it as "cheating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Food-Related Offers and Choices

Food becomes a significant factor influencing [[contestants_decision_making|decisions]].
*   **Oatmeal Discontent**: The provided oatmeal is widely disliked, described as "not good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a> and "so bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Its poor quality even prompts some participants to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Taco Bell Offer (Kids)**: Mr. Beast offers Taco Bell if two kids leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. The kids collectively reject this offer, shouting "No!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Despite the rejection, a few individuals still choose to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>, leading to a sense of "more money for us" among those who remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Coffee Offer (Adults)**: For the adults, the incentive is coffee. They readily accept the offer of 75 cups of coffee in exchange for two adults leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The arrival of coffee is met with widespread happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Pizza Offer (Kids)**: Later, kids are offered pizza for dinner if they allow their cube to shrink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Despite initial chants for "Oatmeal, oatmeal!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, they ultimately accept the offer and receive whole pizzas, which significantly boosts morale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Zone Shrinkage and Button Challenges

The game introduces new mechanics that demand quick [[decision_making and strategy among contestants|decision-making]] and coordination.
*   **Button Race**: A large button in front of each cube, turning green at some point, allows the first team to press it to shrink the other team's zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
    *   **Adults' Strategy**: The adults explicitly discuss their [[contestant_strategies_and_dynamics|strategy]], stating they have "three people that are ready to run out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a> and are "jacked" from coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
    *   **False Alarms**: Karl intentionally changes the button color to blue to try and trick participants into stepping out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. One participant falls for it and steps out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
    *   **Outcome**: The adults win the button race, shrinking the kids' zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

## Psychological Tactics and Pranks

The hosts employ various psychological [[strategies_and_tactics_used_by_contestants|tactics]] to encourage participants to leave.
*   **Empty Briefcase**: An "empty briefcase" is brought in to tempt participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
    *   **Kids' Response**: Some kids fall for the temptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>, though one correctly infers it might be a trick, noting, "in all the other videos it was empty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, implying a general distrust of the hosts' motives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
    *   **Adults' Response**: The adults, despite expectations of being "too smart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, also fall for the empty briefcase trick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **$1 Offer**: A dollar bill is dangled as bait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Another participant leaves, claiming not to have seen the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **No-Pop Balloon**: Balloons are dropped into the cubes with instructions not to pop them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
    *   **Kids' Reaction**: The kids pop their balloon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>, leading to their cube being shrunk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
    *   **Adults' Reaction**: The adults pass the balloon test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, but one steps on a dividing line and is eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, exclaiming, "I made y'all more money!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## Final Stages and Motivation

As the challenge progresses, space shrinks, and motivation is tested.
*   **Dividing Lines**: Lines are introduced to divide the cube space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Stepping over these lines leads to elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>, increasing stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a> and making movements, like going to the bathroom, more challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
*   **Teacher Incentive**: A teacher visits the kids' cube, promising no homework for the rest of the year if they win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. This acts as a significant [[prize_incentives_and_participant_decisions|incentive]] for the kids, bolstering their determination to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   **Feastables Offer**: Close to the end, participants are offered Feastables chocolate bars if they say "Hershey sucks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. Most agree, prioritizing the chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
*   **Last-Minute Temptation**: With only 30 minutes left, an adult leaves for $5,000 offered by Nolan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. This individual expresses satisfaction at having increased the winnings for remaining adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.
*   **Final Outcome**: The adults ultimately win the challenge by a landslide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:26]</a>, with each remaining adult receiving $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. The kids who stayed receive $1,000 as a thank you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

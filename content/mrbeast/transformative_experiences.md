The article discusses a **Transformative Experience** undertaken by Josh, who committed to surviving in a room for 100 days to earn $10,000 daily, potentially becoming a millionaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The challenge explored themes of endurance, isolation, and the evolving value of material possessions versus personal connection.

## The Challenge's Premise and Initial Outlook

Initially, Josh believed the [[challenges_and_social_experiments | challenge]] would be "very easy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. His room was described as his "apartment now," where he made money instead of paying rent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. He had amenities like a treadmill, an ice cream machine, and a private chef who would cook anything he wanted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. However, Jim, the organizer, anticipated the difficulty of the [[challenges_and_social_experiments | challenge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Evolving Rules and Increasing Difficulty

On day one, a crucial rule was revealed: for every $10,000 received, Josh had to give up one item from the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This drastically changed his perspective, causing him to worry about his choices, such as between a family portrait or a guitar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. He aimed to be strategic to maintain enough items to stay occupied for the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

Over time, more items were removed:
*   The ice cream machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
*   A whiteboard (as he could write on walls) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>
*   His picture with his sister, chosen by Carl in exchange for an extra $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>
*   The drum set, which he broke out of frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>
*   The flame thrower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>
*   The recliner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>
*   The treadmill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>
*   The VR headset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>
*   The hot tub, removed destructively by Chris using a forklift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. This event provided "the most excitement" Josh had experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   The pool table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>
*   The basketball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>

By day 23, only his guitar and bed remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. The room also became messy due to the item removals and forklift damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

## Mental and Emotional Toll

As the [[challenges_and_social_experiments | challenge]] progressed, Josh's mental state deteriorated. He lost his concept of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a> and became increasingly bored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. He missed his girlfriend significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a> and felt the [[emotional_effects_of_longterm_challenges | lack of fresh air]], experiencing sickness and a messed-up throat, which led him to consider pushing the red button and leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. He expressed feeling like he was "just existing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a> and that his only remaining source of sanity was his guitar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. When a string on his guitar broke, he reached his "last straw" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

## Turning Point: Realization and Proposal

A significant moment occurred on day 12 when Josh's girlfriend, Kenna, delivered $5,000 (instead of $10,000 from Jim), marking their longest time apart in their six-year relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Though their interaction was limited to 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, it impacted him profoundly, making him question if it helped or hurt him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

On day 13, Josh made a bet with Chandler, leading to him giving $20,000 to Chris and Chandler to buy an engagement ring for Kenna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. He revealed he had wanted to propose for years and that being trapped in the room made him realize "how valuable time is," and he was "done waiting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Seeing the ring made him want to get out "more than anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

The breaking of the guitar string on day 23 led him to smash the guitar, revealing an [[experiences_of_receiving_unexpected_gifts | unexpected check for $100,000]] hidden inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

## Conclusion of the Challenge

Having accumulated $340,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a> and with the realization that he no longer wanted to wait to propose, Josh decided to end the [[challenges_and_social_experiments | challenge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. He tearfully expressed his love for Kenna, stating that the time apart made him realize how much he needed her, and then proposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Kenna accepted, and his family was also brought out for a reunion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. Josh's [[final_thoughts_and_reflections_on_the_experience | final thoughts]] were of joy, breathing in the "fresh air" after leaving the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

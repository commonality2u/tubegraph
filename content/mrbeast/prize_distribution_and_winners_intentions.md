The main prize in this challenge was a unique, recurring payment for life, structured around video views. Additional prizes were also awarded throughout the duration of the challenge, influencing participant comfort and decisions. Participants expressed clear intentions regarding how they would use any prize money won.

## Prize Structure and Winning Mechanics

The central prize offered was $1,000 for every 1 million views the video received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This prize was to be awarded to the last participant to remain in their designated circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The winner would be "paid for life," meaning if the video gained another million views seven years later, they would receive another thousand dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The host clarified that every time someone watches the video, the winner earns one-tenth of a penny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

The potential earnings were highlighted by comparing the video's entertainment value to a viral video of a baby biting another baby's finger, which had 875 million views. It was suggested that the winner could receive over $870,000 if this video surpassed that benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Ultimately, Tareq won the challenge and will receive one-tenth of a penny every time the video is watched, for the rest of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.

## Additional Prizes and Offers

Throughout the challenge, participants were given opportunities to win various items by popping balloons, which could result in either a "pro" or a "con" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. These included:
*   A kite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>
*   A giant beanbag chair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>
*   An RC car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a> (which was later traded for the beanbag chair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>)
*   A blanket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>

*   A pillow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>

In a final attempt to conclude the challenge, an offer of $5,000 cash was made to one of the two remaining participants to exit their circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. This offer was accepted by Tyler, who expressed that $5,000 was "way more than I ever was expecting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

The logistics of this car giveaway involved the acquisition, transportation, and elaborate distribution of 40 vehicles, culminating in a challenge for the 40 millionth subscriber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Initial Setup and Transportation
Forty cars were acquired for the giveaway, including a Porsche, a Chrysler, a Tesla with a custom "40 mil" wrap, and even a SpongeBob-themed car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The estimated cost for these vehicles was over $300,000, potentially reaching $500,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

All 40 cars were loaded onto car haulers for transport, as the subscriber lived 10 hours away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. After a 10-hour drive, the team arrived at the subscriber's location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Selecting the Winner and The Challenge
The 40 millionth subscriber, Luke, was identified from YouTube's list of most recent subscribers by refreshing the list when the milestone was hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. He was only told he had a surprise and was unaware he would be [[giving_away_40_cars | receiving 40 cars]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

Upon arrival, Luke was blindfolded to heighten the surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The cars were then unloaded into his lawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Once the surprise was revealed, Luke was presented with a challenge: if he could give away all 40 cars in under 24 hours, he would win a custom-wrapped Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Car Distribution Strategy
Luke's strategy for [[winners_and_prizes_distribution | distributing the cars]] involved:
*   **Family and Friends** He began by giving cars to his brother, Jake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, his 10-year-old little brother Ben <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, his parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, grandparents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, and great aunt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. He also gave a car to his football coach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a> and his dad's co-worker, Steve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **Public Outreach** To give away cars faster, Luke texted friends to come get cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a> and later went to public places like Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a> and Zaxby's to find random recipients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. At Zaxby's, a car was given away by picking a number between one and three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   **Unique Cars and Prizes** The last nine cars were hidden under tarps and described as the "wackiest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Recipients had to choose a car without seeing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Some of these cars included:
    *   A Jurassic Park Jeep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
    *   A car that ran out of gas immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
    *   A car with a water gun feature, chosen by Karl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
    *   An amphibious car that did not work, containing money in the back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
    *   A car that was "three trucks glued together," which contained PlayStations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
    *   Karl's own car, which had been previously taken and damaged, was the very last car given away to "Little Jimmy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.

After successfully giving away all 40 cars within the 24-hour limit, Luke received the Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.

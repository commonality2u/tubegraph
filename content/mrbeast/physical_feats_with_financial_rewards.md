Various challenges offer substantial financial incentives, pushing individuals to demonstrate strength, dexterity, endurance, or precision for a chance to win significant cash or valuable prizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These [[moneybased_competitions_and_incentives | money-based competitions]] highlight the physical demands of unique contests.

## Challenges of Strength and Endurance

Participants face tests requiring considerable physical exertion and resilience:

*   **Cash Carry Challenge**
    *   Individuals are tasked with carrying "as much cash as you can carry," stuffing bills into pockets, hoodies, pants, and shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. One participant successfully carried $6,751 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Another contestant later wore tube socks specifically to increase their capacity for carrying money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Money Tray Stacking**
    *   A waitress was challenged to stack as much money as possible on a tray without it falling, risking losing everything if it toppled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. She successfully stacked approximately $8,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, which was considerably more than her biggest tip of $200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Money Bag Filling**
    *   Restaurant coworkers were given one minute to fill bags with as much money as they could <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Duffel Bag Hold**
    *   Two camera crew members were challenged to hold 50-pound duffel bags, each containing $50,000, with the first person to set their bag down losing their share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This challenge lasted over five hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Camaro Deadlift**
    *   The "four times [[competing_against_professional_athletes_for_charity_or_cash | World's Strongest Man]]" was challenged to deadlift a Camaro attached to a deadlift bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. If successful, he could keep the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. He successfully lifted the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Money Bench Press**
    *   A contestant named Frank was dared to bench press as much money as he could <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. He attempted to bench press $21,000 but required assistance, resulting in a portion of his winnings being confiscated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Challenges of Dexterity and Precision

These challenges test fine motor skills and careful execution under pressure:

*   **iPhone Stacking**
    *   A contestant was given a tiny rectangle and unlimited iPhones, with the goal of stacking as many as possible as high as desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. If the stack fell, they would win nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Each iPhone was valued at approximately $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. The contestant successfully stacked 32 iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Laser Obstacle Course**
    *   A contestant carrying a mountain of cash had to navigate a laser obstacle course to win car keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Touching a laser or dropping any money meant losing everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. The contestant ultimately failed, dropping the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Ring Stacking**
    *   At a jeweler's, a contestant was challenged to fit as many rings as possible on her finger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. She managed to fit rings totaling $25,000 in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

## Unique and Immersive Challenges

Some contests involve unusual scenarios or large-scale environments:

*   **Orbeez Pool Money Hunt**
    *   A contestant named Adam was placed in a pool full of Orbeez and given 60 seconds to find $100,000 in vacuum-sealed bags hidden at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. He managed to retrieve $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   **Sumo Wrestling for Prizes**
    *   In one scenario, a contestant predicted the winner of a Sumo wrestling match between two individuals, Chandler and Chris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. The prize for the predictor was a Rolex, while the winner's mother received $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
    *   Later, two camera crew members, Timmy and Tareq, engaged in a Sumo wrestling match while still carrying $25,000 each on their backs from the earlier duffel bag challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. The winner would keep their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Tareq lost his money by stepping out of the ring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

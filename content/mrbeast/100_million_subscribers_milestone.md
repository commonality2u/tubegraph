Upon reaching 100 million subscribers, a significant celebration was held where a private island was purchased and given to one subscriber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The event involved 100 subscribers competing in four [[extreme_challenges_for_subscribers | extreme challenges]] for the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This milestone was personally significant, representing over a decade of dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>, and the creator expressed deep gratitude to all subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## The Challenges

The competition for the private island progressed through multiple elimination rounds:

### Challenge 1: Fire Starting
The first challenge required the 100 contestants to start a fire and light a torch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The first 50 people to succeed moved on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. While estimates suggested it would take an average of 20 minutes to start a fire, some contestants achieved it in under a minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. After this challenge, 50 people lost their chance to win the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Challenge 2: Red Light, Green Light
The second challenge was a recreation of "Squid Game," specifically the "Red Light, Green Light" game, set in the middle of the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Contestants were aware of the rules from a previous viral video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The first 20 people to step on or cross a red line advanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This version had no time limit, allowing for prolonged "Red Light" periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. One contestant advanced by correctly identifying a technicality in the host's phrasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Challenge 3: Earliest Subscriber Elimination
After the "Red Light, Green Light" challenge, 20 contestants remained with only 10 seats available on a raft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. As a special advantage for the 100 million subscriber milestone, the earliest subscriber present was tasked with eliminating half of the remaining participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This decision was difficult for the subscriber, Gabbie, who was seen apologizing to those she eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. The remaining 10 contestants then proceeded to a pirate ship for the next challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### Challenge 4: Plank Elimination
On the pirate ship, 10 planks were rigged, with 5 designed to drop contestants and 5 that would not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. Contestants individually chose a plank, and a rope attached to it was cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This challenge reduced the pool of contestants to five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

### Challenge 5: $50,000 Offer
The final five contestants were taken to the private island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Before the last challenge, each was offered a check for $50,000 to leave the competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. All five chose to burn their $50,000 checks and continue competing for the island, despite the dwindling odds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

## The Grand Prize Winner

The final challenge involved a scavenger hunt for the 100 million subscriber play button, which had the deed to the island taped to its back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. The contestants were blindfolded while the play button was hidden on the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. The island itself was described as massive, featuring a cabana, a helicopter pad, and a beautiful pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. The play button was hidden close to the starting point, despite the contestants being driven far away to mislead them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

After a tense search, one contestant, a woman named Gabby, found the play button and won the private island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. She expressed disbelief at winning what she called the "craziest video" the creator had ever done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

## Subscriber Appreciation and Merchandise

The creator expressed profound appreciation to everyone who subscribed, stating that the channel means the world to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. As a thank you, all eliminated contestants from the "Red Light, Green Light" challenge received $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

To celebrate the 100 million subscriber milestone, limited edition merchandise was released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. Purchasing any item from this drop would grant access to an unreleased video, costing over half a million dollars to produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. The creator also offered to be the first customer for 100 random people who created a Shopify store through a specific link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

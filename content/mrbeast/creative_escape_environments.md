Throughout a high-stakes chase for a $100,000 prize, various [[Creative Escape Environments | creative escape environments]] and challenges were utilized to evade pursuers. These environments ranged from natural landscapes to custom-built structures and public spaces, each designed with unique obstacles and strategic elements.

## Woods and Road Obstacles
The initial leg of the chase involved navigating through a wooded area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. To create an early challenge, a giant telephone pole was strategically placed to block the exit road, requiring physical effort to remove it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This immediate obstacle served as an initial "elimination tactic" to slow down the pursuers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Enormous Hedge Maze
A significant portion of the chase took place within an enormous hedge maze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Design**: The maze was described as "huge" and disorienting, making it easy to get lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. However, the participant had prior knowledge of its layout, having "done this maze like 10 times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Strategic Elements**:
    *   **Breadcrumbs**: Money was intentionally left in the maze to confirm the pursuers were on the correct path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
    *   **Internal Features**: The maze contained a "cave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a> and a "watch tower" from which the entire maze could be observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
    *   **Secret Exit**: A hidden "secret door" was installed to allow for a quick and unexpected escape from the maze, disguised with a sign reading "Authorized Maze Personnel Only," which was then changed to "Jimmy's Getaway Car" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Walmart as a Hiding Spot
A public Walmart store was used as a [[Creative Escape Environments | creative escape environment]] for [[creative hiding strategies and outcomes | hiding]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Disguise**: The participant employed a disguise, wearing an "old man suit," a hat, and glasses, referring to himself as "Boomer Jim" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The money bag was also disguised by being placed inside another bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Elimination Tactic**: While inside, an accomplice used a pickax to pop the tires of the pursuers' car in the parking lot, stranding them temporarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. This was described as an [[creative elimination tactics | elimination tactic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## U-Store (Storage Facility)
A U-Store storage locker facility was used as an [[Creative Escape Environments | escape environment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Setup**: A storage locker was purchased, and a sign was placed with the cryptic message: "Time is running out. I was in the box." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Hiding Strategy**: The participant and an accomplice hid inside boxes within the storage unit, effectively being "shipped alive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **Escape Method**: The escape was facilitated by being transported out of the facility in a box truck, which was described as a "getaway" vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

## Private Island with Swan Boats
A private island was rented and used as an [[Creative Escape Environments | escape environment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Arrival**: The participant arrived at the island by boat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
*   **Pursuit Challenge**: The pursuers were provided with "swan boats" to reach the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, which proved to be "unreasonably slow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Distraction**: The participant feigned a broken boat to create a false sense of opportunity for the pursuers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Internal Navigation**: Upon reaching the island, both the participant and pursuers initially became lost, highlighting the island's natural complexity as a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

## NFL Football Stadium
An entire NFL football stadium was rented to serve as a grand finale [[Creative Escape Environments | creative escape environment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Scale**: The stadium was immense, with "over 70,000 seats and unlimited rooms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
*   **Deception Tactics**:
    *   **Looping Video**: A pre-recorded video of the participant mocking the pursuers was played on a loop on the stadium's screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
    *   **Mannequins**: The stadium was filled with mannequins to confuse the pursuers, making them think they were seeing the participant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This was a direct element of [[creative use of space and props in entertainment | creative use of space and props]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Chase**: The chase within the stadium involved navigation through various levels, including escalators that were turned off to create an additional obstacle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   **Final Hiding Strategy**: The participant attempted to [[creative hiding strategies and outcomes | hide]] by changing into a mannequin's clothes and posing among them, blending into the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

These environments showcase a variety of [[creative challenges for entertainment | creative challenges]] and [[creative problemsolving in extreme challenges | problemsolving]] within a game setting, demonstrating how diverse spaces can be transformed into complex escape scenarios.

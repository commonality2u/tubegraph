In MrBeast's recent video, contestants aged from 1 to 100 participated in a unique [[ages_1_to_100_competition | competitive challenge]] to win a grand prize of $250,000. Throughout the challenge, age alliances and strategies played a significant role in determining which contestants advanced and who would ultimately claim victory.

## The Formation of Alliances

### Natural Alliances: The 40's Alliance
Initially, contestants quickly recognized the potential advantage of banding together based on age. One of the most noted alliances formed was the **40's alliance** [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">00:08:25</a>]. This group of middle-aged participants aimed to stick together and protect each other from eliminations. The members were quick to unite, showing a clear strategy to maintain their group's presence in the game.

### The Fall of the 40's Alliance
Despite their initial strength, the 40's alliance faced challenges that eventually led to their downfall. A crucial turning point occurred during a segment where contestants had the power to eliminate each other through decision-making processes [[decision_making_and_the_impact_of_monetary_incentives | decision-making processes]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">00:32:00</a>]. This segment displayed internal conflicts and betrayals that fractured the once-solid group. Every eligible contestant in their alliance was put to the vote, leading to unexpected eliminations, showcasing the volatility and fragility of alliances in high-stake games [[elimination_drama_in_competitive_events | high-stake games]].

## Age-Related Strategies

### Utilizing Age to Influence Decisions
Some contestants attempted to use their age as a strategic advantage. For example, older participants appealed to younger contestants for sympathy, requesting not to be eliminated due to their advanced age [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">00:13:00</a>]. Conversely, younger contestants used their youth and perceived innocence to their advantage; in some cases, relying on emotional appeals that resonated with the crowd and judges.

### Shared Experiences and Trust
Participants often found shared experiences in their age groups, using these commonalities to build trust and form alliances [[alliance_strategies_in_competitive_games | form alliances]]. These elements of trust became crucial during decisions that involved removing contestants or surviving particular challenges [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">00:12:14</a>]. The 40's alliance, for example, used interpersonal relationships to ensure their collective advancement.

### Strategies in Final Rounds
As the challenge progressed into the final rounds, strategies evolved [[strategies_in_highstakes_competitions | strategies evolved]]. When direct voting and eliminations were conducted, contestants relied more on the negotiations and forming temporary reconciliations to navigate through tense situations [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">00:30:30</a>]. The video underscores how participants employed both strategic solitude and coalition tactics to steer clear of eliminations.

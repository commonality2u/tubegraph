In a real-life recreation of [[willy_wonkas_chocolate_factory_recreation | Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory]], ten contestants, each a recipient of a [[golden_ticket_contest_and_challenges | golden ticket]] found in Feastable Bars, competed in a series of [[unique_contests_and_games | creative and unique games for entertainment]] to win the entire chocolate factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

The factory itself was a [[willy_wonkas_chocolate_factory_recreation | wonderful creation]] filled with candy, including a chocolate river and waterfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The challenges pushed contestants to their limits, with eliminations leading to a unique exit via the chocolate river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Hide and Seek
The first challenge was a game of hide and seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Contestants were given 1,000 seconds to find hiding spots within the vast chocolate factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The factory's unique areas included a marshmallow area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a> and "Wollamhsram Room" (Marshmallow backwards) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The last person found was eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Candy Wall of Death
This challenge involved climbing a tall "Candy Wall of Death," a rock climbing wall covered in candy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The last person to reach the top and press a red button was eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Two contestants who couldn't make it to the top faced a rock, paper, scissors showdown to determine who was eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Chocolate Bar Speed Eating Contest
Contestants were paired up for a chocolate bar speed eating challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Professional eaters Matt Stonie and Joey Chestnut demonstrated the technique for consuming new Feastables milk chocolate and sea salt bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The last team to finish eating their chocolate bars was eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## World's Largest Mento Drop
Outside the factory, the remaining six contestants faced a challenge involving the world's largest bottle of Coke and the world's largest Mento <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Contestants took turns attempting to drop the oversized Mento into the bottle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The person who successfully landed the Mento in the bottle was given the power to choose who would be eliminated from the competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. The eliminated contestant received a solid gold Mentos as a prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

## Peppermint Carousel Challenge
This challenge took place in a room covered with marshmallows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Contestants had to stand on individual spinning peppermint carousels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. The carousels gradually increased in speed, and the first person to fall off was eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## Cake Toilet Challenge
For this challenge, four toilets were presented: three were real, and one was made entirely of cake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Each contestant, while blindfolded, chose a toilet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. The person who chose the cake toilet was eliminated from the competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

## Dessert Cooking Challenge
The final challenge was a cooking competition judged by special guest Gordon Ramsay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. The three remaining contestants had 45 minutes to create a dessert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Gordon Ramsay judged each dessert on its appearance (out of 10) and taste (out of 10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. The contestant with the highest overall score won the chocolate factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. The second-place finisher received $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.

In a surprising turn, the winner of the chocolate factory was immediately offered and accepted half a million dollars to sell the factory back, acknowledging the high costs of maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

A group of individuals find themselves stranded after a private jet crashes, with an average rescue time of 31 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This unexpected [[survival_in_the_wilderness | survival in the wilderness]] scenario immediately highlights the critical importance of [[handling_food_and_water_during_isolation | handling food and water during isolation]] for endurance.

## Initial Resource Assessment and Rationing
Upon assessing the crash site, the survivors locate water bottles and snacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Recognizing their predicament, a crucial decision is made to ration these limited supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The only available food and water are items typically stocked on a private jet, which are minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This emphasizes the immediate need for [[resource_management_in_survival_situations | resource management]] in such a dire situation.

> "The only food and water we have to survive is what's typically stocked on a private jet. These tiny planes really don't have much food and water." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>

Despite the plan, one individual consumes their entire share of four water bottles early due to thirst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, quickly leading to questions about the adherence to rationing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Challenges of Dehydration and Hunger
As time progresses, the lack of adequate sustenance becomes a major [[challenges_of_extreme_survival_scenarios | challenge]]. Participants report not having had water for six hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, and the group begins to experience the effects of dehydration, stating they are "starting to go crazy" even before the halfway point of the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

By the second morning, food supplies are depleted, with only about ten packs of peanuts remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Attempts to Find External Resources
To combat the dwindling supplies, the group decides to search for a river previously spotted with a drone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, showcasing an attempt at [[finding_food_and_resources_in_the_wild | finding food and resources in the wild]]. However, the journey proves difficult, with individuals experiencing dizziness and purple dots in their vision, possibly due to dehydration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Upon reaching the river, they determine the water is not clean enough to drink or bathe in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, leading to continued headaches and dehydration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Impact of Deprivation
The [[survival_challenges | survival challenges]] become increasingly difficult. Participants express their discomfort due to lack of sleep, extreme temperature changes, and especially the lack of food and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. One participant explicitly states, "We ran out of water 10 hours ago" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. They lament the insufficient water packed on the plane for a crash scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

The experience highlights the stark reality that [[outdoor_survival_skills | outdoor survival skills]] are heavily reliant on basic provisions. The difficulty of the situation is underscored by comparisons to previous [[challenges_and_survival_strategies | survival challenges]]:

*   Compared to 24 hours in a desert, this plane crash scenario is considered harder because, in the desert, they had water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   Compared to 50 hours in the wilderness, this is also deemed "way harder" because in the wilderness, they had water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

This reinforces the undeniable truth: "Almost like you need water to survive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. As rescue approaches after 31 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, the survivors' primary thoughts are of getting water and taking a shower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. The lack of food, water, showers, and sleep are collectively cited as reasons why the experience was not enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

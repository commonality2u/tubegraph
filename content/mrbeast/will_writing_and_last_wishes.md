In a unique and entertaining twist on the age-old concept of preparing wills, YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson, known as MrBeast, and his friends crafted their last wishes while embarking on a thrilling [[survival_challenges_at_sea | 24-hour challenge in the enigmatic Bermuda Triangle]]. The light-hearted yet oddly contemplative activity provided both entertainment and insight into the importance of being prepared for unexpected outcomes.

## Setting the Stage

The crew's adventure began with Jimmy and his companions aboard a [[comparison_of_yachts_by_price | yacht]] bravely venturing into the heart of the Bermuda Triangle. Known for its treacherous reputation, this region of the North Atlantic Ocean has been the subject of numerous theories and mystery due to the numerous disappearances of ships and aircrafts without a trace [[bermuda_triangle_myths_and_dangers | Bermuda Triangle myths and dangers]]. With over 100 such incidents on record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, the anticipation and apprehension were palpable.

As a humorous yet reflective precaution, the group decided to document their wills, highlighting their last wishes for their possessions were something unfortunate to happen. Jimmy suggested, "Me and the boys are going to spend 24 hours straight in the Bermuda Triangle. Wish us luck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Crafting Last Wishes

The members took turns recording their final wishes, providing a glimpse into their personal priorities and cherished belongings. While delivered in a jovial tone, their statements underscored the sentimental and often practical considerations that go into such decisions.

- **Chris** humorously declared that he would leave his home, vehicle, pets, and monetary assets to his wife, while cheekily keeping his web history private [[psychological_effects_of_confinement | psychological effects of confinement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
- **Viking** opted to leave his [[experience_on_a_1_yacht_vs_expensive_yachts | boat]] to his father while ensuring that specific memories were entrusted to personal friends and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
- **Chandler** expressed his wish for his mother to keep his [[comparison_of_low_and_high_value_cars | car]] and gaming console as sentimental reminders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## The Experience and Its Reflections

Throughout the 24-hour journey, the team confronted seasickness, challenging weather, and inevitable chaos that comes with being in a supposed danger zone [[dealing_with_harsh_weather_conditions | dealing with harsh weather conditions]]. These experiences brought additional humor and realism to their testamentary arrangements. Despite the playful premise, the activity prompted consideration of being prepared for unforeseen situations [[decision_making_and_honesty_in_high_stakes_situations | decision making and honesty in high stakes situations]].

Jimmy encapsulated the mood of the adventure, stating, "While the seasickness, the camera falling in the ocean, and Chandler winning three challenges in a row, were all bizarre occurrences, we still weren’t convinced it was the Bermuda Triangle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

Ultimately, the crew returned safely, having [[successful_completion_of_a_highstakes_challenge | survived the Bermuda Triangle's grip unscathed]]—and all the wiser for having mocked up their last wills and testaments amid the laughter and camaraderie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

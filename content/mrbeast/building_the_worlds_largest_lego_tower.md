A challenge was undertaken to [[strategies_and_challenges_in_constructing_tall_lego_structures | build the world's largest Lego tower]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The objective was to construct the tallest tower within 12 hours, with the winning team receiving $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Challenge Setup

The competition featured two main participants:
*   Chris, starting with a foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, partnered with Carl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   Chandler, starting with a platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, partnered with Tyler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

Participants were allowed to use [[the_use_of_heavy_machinery_in_lego_construction | heavy duty machinery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> to assist in construction. An initial pile of Lego bricks was available, with additional supplies stored in trucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

Initially, each team began with two people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, but later expanded to four members each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Mid-Challenge Obstacles and Strategies

### Bowling Ball Attacks
A "bowling ball" was introduced as an obstacle to damage the towers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Chandler's team had constructed a wall to protect their tower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, which proved effective during the initial attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Chris's team, initially focusing on height, had to rebuild after damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### Mini-Challenge
A 20-minute mini-challenge was held where the tallest tower would win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The losing team had to remove a member for 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

Chris's team's tower reached approximately eight and a half feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Chandler's team's tower reached 20 feet and two inches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, winning the mini-challenge. As a result, Zach from Chris's team was removed for 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

### Structural Reinforcement
Chandler's team decided to incorporate concrete into their bricks to enhance stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, pouring it down the middle of the structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

## Team Setbacks and the Final Push

### Chandler's Departure
Chandler left the challenge due to exhaustion, stating that all proceeds would go to his team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Tower Collapse
Chris's team's tower collapsed from approximately 35-40 feet to about 15 feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Despite this, the team remained positive and planned to rebuild <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

> "Hurts a little bit more than you probably realize. We can come back from it though. Positivity!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>

## Final Measurement and Prize

With two hours remaining, both teams worked to maximize their tower's height and [[strategies_and_challenges_in_constructing_tall_lego_structures | stability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Before the final measurement, another bowling ball throw was allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Chandler's team's wall again successfully defended against the bowling ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

The final measurements were:
*   Chris's tower: 29 feet and four and a half inches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   Chandler's (now Timmy's) tower: 29 feet and five and a half inches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

Chandler's team won by exactly one Lego block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, securing the $50,000 prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

### Prize Distribution

The winning team had one hour to spend the $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   Timmy gave $17,000 to Zach to pay off his student loan debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   Weddle gave $4,000 to his brother Carson for a car and $10,000 to his mother due to reduced work hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   Tyler spent his share on one year of free rent for his mom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

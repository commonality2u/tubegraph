This article details an experiment where a participant, Will, was challenged to [[construction_and_defense_strategies | construct a fortress]] to protect a significant sum of money from large quantities of TNT.

## The Challenge
MrBeast presented Will with $50,000, which was surrounded by thousands of pounds of TNT [00:02:41]. Will was given a credit card with no spending limit and was tasked with protecting the money using any materials he desired, such as wood, bricks, or steel [00:03:00]. The condition was that whatever money remained after the TNT explosion, Will would keep [00:03:04].

## Initial Defense Strategy
Will began by purchasing twelve industrial water containers and filling them with 20,000 pounds of water [00:03:13]. He expressed concern that the TNT might still penetrate this initial defense [00:03:20].

## The Deal: Doubling the Stakes
Impressed by Will's dedication, MrBeast offered a deal: if Will allowed the amount of TNT to be doubled, the prize money would also be doubled to $100,000 [00:05:44]. Will accepted the offer [00:05:54].

## Fortress Construction
Over seven days, Will worked with professionals to build a formidable seven-layer fortress around the money [00:05:32]. The layers of the fortress included:
*   20,000 pounds of water [00:07:37]
*   Mattresses [00:07:39]
*   A cinder block wall [00:07:41]
*   Four more mattresses [00:07:41]
*   A second cinder block wall [00:07:43]
*   An additional 32,000 pounds of water [00:07:45]
*   A final wall of dirt [00:07:49]

Will also incorporated a secret, additional layer that MrBeast was unaware of [00:07:51]. This hidden layer was a Feastables bar placed as an ultimate protection [00:08:00].

## The Explosion
With the fortress complete and the TNT doubled, the explosives were detonated [00:08:04]. The resulting explosion created a massive smoke cloud, temporarily obscuring visibility of the site [00:08:36].

## Outcome
Despite the immense power of the [[extreme_dynamite_and_explosives_experiments | explosion]], over $95,000 of the money survived the blast [00:08:56]. Will successfully protected the majority of the prize money [00:09:00].

Competitive events frequently feature large cash prizes as incentives for participants, often pitting professional athletes against everyday individuals, or simply offering substantial rewards for challenging feats. These events are designed to be high-stakes, with outcomes that can significantly impact the winners or chosen charities.

## Featured Competitive Events with High-Value Prizes

### Football Target Challenge
In a challenge featuring [[games_and_contests_with_highvalue_prizes | Tom Brady]], a high school football player named Jake competed against him in a balloon-popping contest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The first to pop all four balloons would win $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Given Tom Brady's seven Super Bowl rings, his targets were slightly smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. If Tom won, the prize money was designated for charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Jake ultimately won the $100,000 prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Sprint Race Handicap
World champion sprinter [[games_and_contests_with_highvalue_prizes | Noah Lyles]] raced Jonah, a friend of the show's host, for $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. The race was 200 meters, but Jonah was offered a handicap where every ten meters shaved off his total distance would cost him $10,000 of the prize money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Jonah accepted a 60-meter head start, reducing his potential winnings to $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. If Lyles won, the money would go to charity; if Jonah won, it would go into his bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Lyles won the race and donated the prize money to his charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

Later, Noah Lyles returned to race streamer IShowSpeed for another $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. This 50-meter race stipulated that if Lyles won, the money would go to his charity, and if Speed won, it would go to one of his fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. Lyles again won and chose to donate the $100,000 to the kids he works for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

Big Justice's fence was half the distance of Harper's to account for their size difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. If Big Justice won, he would receive the money; if Harper won, it would be donated to his chosen charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Big Justice won the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

### Golf Challenge
Two-time major golf champion [[games_and_contests_with_highvalue_prizes | Bryson DeChambeau]] faced off against an amateur golfer named Aaron for $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. Aaron's hole was 50 times larger than DeChambeau's to balance the competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. If Aaron won, the money would be wired to his bank account; if DeChambeau won, it would go to his desired charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. DeChambeau stated he wanted to give the money to charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

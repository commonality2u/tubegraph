In a thrilling and adventurous event, YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson, famously known as [[mrbeast_challenge_concepts | MrBeast]], hosted a unique hunting challenge involving 100 of his subscribers. Each subscriber was entrusted with $10,000, and the task was simple yet nerve-wrackingâ€”they had to evade being found by MrBeast and his team within the confines of one of the [[large_mall_as_a_hiding_venue | largest malls in the world]]. If they succeeded, they kept the $10,000; if not, the money was returned to MrBeast [00:00:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>).

## The Setup

The stakes were set high as MrBeast closed off the mall for this high-stakes hide-and-seek game. The game was scheduled to last for 10 intense hours, and each of the participants received the $10,000 upfront, adding to the adrenaline rush of the [[high_stakes_adventures_with_surprising_twists | challenge]] [00:00:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>).

## The Hunt Begins

The vastness of the mall meant the hiding spots were nearly endless, from Toy R Us to an ice rink and even a ski resort. MrBeast and his team, including popular collaborators like [[inclusion_of_a_swat_team_and_celebrity_cameo | Sapnap and Marques Brownlee]], split up to cover more ground [00:00:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>). 

Participants quickly discovered creative hiding spots, such as hidden behind vending machines or atop ladders in the ceiling [00:01:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>). They leveraged areas like the Toys R Us and utilized disguises to [[strategies_for_evading_capture_through_disguises_and_decoys | blend in with mannequins]] [00:00:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>). Innovative tactics were often the key to temporary success.

## Dramatic Pursuits and Narrow Escapes

Nolan and other team members sifted through various shops, including furniture stores with massive stuffed animals, to locate contestants [00:04:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>). In one memorable instance, a contestant was chased down near a water park area, highlighting the pressure and [[psychological_and_physical_challenges_of_endurance_competitions | high stakes]] as time ticked down [00:03:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>).

## Backup: The SWAT Team

As the search intensified and with the clock ticking away, MrBeast brought in a SWAT team equipped with thermal drones to help locate the remaining participants. Their involvement dramatically sped up the process as they uncovered hiding places that had gone unnoticed earlier [00:05:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>). This strategic move added a new layer of [[successful_completion_of_a_highstakes_challenge | drama to the event]].

## The Last Stand

With mere minutes left, MrBeast's team and the participants were both visibly exhausted. Despite several attempts to lure contestants out, many held their ground, hoping to secure the prize till the very end [00:11:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>).

As the final countdown ended, jubilant contestants emerged as winners, each claiming their $10,000 prize. Remarkably, out of the million dollars at stake, MrBeast managed to spend approximately half a million, a testament to the [[participants_motivations_and_stories | ingenuity and resolve]] of the participants [00:11:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>).

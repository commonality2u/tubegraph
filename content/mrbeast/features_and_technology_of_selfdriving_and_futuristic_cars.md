Modern automotive technology extends far beyond traditional driving, encompassing vehicles that can operate autonomously, transform for different environments, and even fly. This evolution showcases a significant leap in vehicle design and capability.

## Self-Driving Capabilities

The [[comparison_of_inexpensive_versus_highend_luxury_cars | $100,000 car]] featured, identified as a Tesla, demonstrates advanced self-driving technology. This vehicle is capable of moving without an occupant inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The primary reason for purchasing such a car is its ability to drive itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. It can navigate roads, switch lanes autonomously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, and accelerate without human input on the gas or steering wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. However, it is explicitly stated that drivers should not attempt to nap while the car is driving itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Transformable and Amphibious Vehicles

Futuristic car designs include [[exploration_of_amphibious_and_transformable_vehicles | vehicles that transform]] for various purposes:

*   **Flying Cars:** One car featured can literally transform into an airplane and fly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This vehicle is street-legal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, equipped with wings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, and capable of reaching altitudes of 8,000 feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. It features a visible [[jet_engines_on_cars_and_vehicle_stunts | propeller]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, and its wheels lift off the ground during takeoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>, effectively making it a flying car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. This unique vehicle is priced at $600,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Amphibious "Boat Car":** A $500,000 "boat car" serves as a normal vehicle on land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Its distinctive feature is the ability to drive directly into water and convert into a boat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Once in the water, it can be driven like a conventional car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, capable of performing maneuvers such as donuts and creating whirlpools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## Hydrogen-Powered Prototype

A $2 million limited-edition hydrogen car represents cutting-edge automotive technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This prototype is entirely powered by hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a> and uniquely exhales drinkable water as exhaust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. While still under development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>, it has an impressive range of over 1,000 miles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a> and a top speed of 221 miles per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Its road legality was initially questionable as it had never been driven on a public road before its demonstration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

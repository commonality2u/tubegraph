A large-scale experiment involved filling an entire backyard and a pool with 100 million Orbeez [00:00:45]. The goal was to observe the expansion of these water beads when exposed to rain and conduct various [[fun_challenges_and_competitions_with_orbeez | challenges and competitions]] within the massive quantity of Orbeez.

## Orbeez Collection and Quantity
The experiment began with the collection of an immense number of Orbeez. Initial quantities were presented in increasing amounts: 50,000 [00:00:00], 200,000 [00:00:02], and 400,000 [00:00:05]. Eventually, 1 million Orbeez were displayed [00:00:08], which was stated to be only 1% of the total amount gathered for the project [00:00:11]. The team acquired 100 boxes, with each box containing 1 million Orbeez [00:00:15], summing up to 100 million Orbeez [00:00:45]. These Orbeez are known to grow approximately 30 times their original size when exposed to water [00:00:36].

The strategy to expand the Orbeez involved spreading them across tarps in a backyard and waiting for rain [00:00:54]. The sheer volume of Orbeez raised concerns that they might overflow the fence [00:01:00]. A portion of the Orbeez was initially placed in a pool [00:01:31], where they grew "ginormous" overnight [00:01:59]. Approximately 1 million Orbeez were placed in the pool [00:02:25], with 30 Orbeez capable of filling the palm of a hand once grown [00:02:04]. The remaining 97 million Orbeez were spread out on tarps with the expectation of 10 hours of rain to facilitate their growth [00:02:12]. The backyard was eventually covered with un-grown Orbeez, anticipating the rain to make them all "huge" and fill the area [00:03:51].

## Activities and Challenges
Once the Orbeez had grown, several activities and challenges were conducted:
*   **Trust Fall**: An individual performed a trust fall into the Orbeez, describing the sensation as "laying in macaroni" [00:04:24].
*   **Burial**: A participant was playfully buried alive under the Orbeez, experiencing difficulty breathing [00:05:03].
*   **Blindfolded Plunge**: An individual jumped into the Orbeez pool blindfolded, experiencing immediate panic [00:06:11].
*   **Snorkelling**: An attempt was made to snorkel in the Orbeez, confirming that snorkels could work as long as they didn't go under the Orbeez [00:07:08].
*   **Boogie Boarding**: An attempt to ride a boogie board on the Orbeez was unsuccessful [00:07:23].
*   **Pool Laps Challenge**: Contestants raced to complete two laps in the Orbeez-filled pool for a $1,000 prize [00:08:03]. Chandler won the challenge, having made a deal to split the prize money with another contestant [00:08:31].
*   **Tightrope Walk**: A tightrope was strung over a "pit of Orbeez" [00:10:11]. Falling into the Orbeez was framed as being a "T-Series fan" and being "banished from the land" [00:09:45], while successfully crossing meant "PewDiePie has forgiven" their sins [00:09:58].

## Post-Experiment Notes
The experiment, which took many days to film, was described as "very expensive" [00:13:20].

### [[biodegradability_and_environmental_impact_of_orbeez | Biodegradability and Environmental Impact of Orbeez]]
It was reiterated that the Orbeez used were biodegradable [00:13:43]. The plan was to pick them all up, with any remaining ones not being harmful to squirrels [00:13:45].

### Future Video Teaser
The video concluded by teasing a future project involving the destruction of a house with slime and purchasing a new one for the residents [00:13:54].

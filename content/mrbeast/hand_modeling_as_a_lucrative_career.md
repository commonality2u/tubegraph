Hand modeling can be an extremely lucrative career, with top professionals earning over $1 million per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. This figure is significantly higher than the average salary of a doctor, with some hand models making five times as much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

## Requirements and Preparation
To succeed as a high-earning hand model, one must possess exceptionally well-maintained hands. Experienced hand models assess several factors:
*   **Nails** Proper care is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Skin Texture** Smooth, even skin is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Hair** Excessive hair on the hands and fingers may need to be removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Cuticles** Issues with cuticles can be addressed and fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **Finger Structure** Good finger structure is an advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

Before a shoot, preparation like waxing may be required to ensure hands are in pristine condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

## The Work Itself
Hand models pose for photographs featuring various products, from watches to video games. The work can involve holding mundane objects or even [[creative_use_of_space_and_props_in_entertainment | unusual items]] like snakes and scorpions for specific campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. Precision and steadiness are crucial, as even slight hand tremors can affect the product's appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

Photos taken for major campaigns can appear on national billboards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

## Notable Aspects
*   **High Insurance Value** A top hand model's hands can be insured for $1,000,000 per hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Extensive Portfolio** Successful hand models typically have a stacked resume, having modeled for numerous well-known brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

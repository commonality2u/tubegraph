The culmination of a series of mystery box unboxings was the opening of the world's claimed largest and most expensive mystery box, valued at $250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This colossal box was acquired alongside several others, ranging from a $100 mystery box to a $100,000 mystery box, totaling over $500,000 in combined value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Unprecedented Size and Origin
The $250,000 mystery box was so large that it could not be shipped to the studio and instead had to be built directly in the warehouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. It was created by MSCHF, a company noted for being very secretive, with their representative's face blurred during the unboxing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. The contents for this box were shipped from various locations across the country over a two-month period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

It was presented as the "world's largest and most expensive mystery box" and also the "most mysterious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. The host confirmed he had no prior knowledge of what was inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

## The Contents Revealed
The box was opened by pressing a button and then pulling, causing it to fall open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
The big reveal was a Lamborghini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. However, it was quickly identified as a Lamborghini tractor, leading to the interesting fact that Lamborghini originally began as a tractor manufacturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. In addition to the tractor, leaf blowers were also found inside the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

The tractor started up, demonstrating its powerful engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>, though it was noted to be low on gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

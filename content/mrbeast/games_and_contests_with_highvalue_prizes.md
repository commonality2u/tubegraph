Various competitive events have been designed to offer [[large_cash_prizes_in_competitive_events | large cash prizes]] and other valuable rewards, often incorporating [[unique_contests_and_games | unique rules]] and physical challenges. These [[highstakes_game_show_formats | high-stakes game show formats]] provide participants with [[creative ways to win money or prizes | creative ways to win money or prizes]].

## Cash Carrying Challenge

In one [[moneybased_competitions and incentives | money-based competition]], contestants were challenged to carry as much cash as possible from a "never-ending giant mountain of cash" [00:00:00]. Participants were encouraged to stuff money into their pockets, hoodies, pants, and shoes [00:00:05]. One participant successfully carried $6,751 [00:00:38].

## Money Stacking on a Tray

Another challenge involved a waitress attempting to stack as much money as possible on a tray [00:00:47]. The [[creative rules for winning prizes | rule]] was that if the stack fell, she would lose all the money [00:00:51]. Starting with $200, the largest tip she had ever received [00:00:58], she steadily built the stack, reaching $8,000 at one point [00:01:04]. Despite initial confidence, she decided to stop stacking as the pile grew perilously high [00:01:24].

### Surprise for Co-workers

As a [[surprise prizes and offers for participants | surprise]], the waitress's co-workers were invited to fill duffel bags with money within a minute [00:01:38]. The host also offered a bag of money to their boss [00:02:11].

## The 50-Pound Money Hold

Two participants were given duffel bags, each containing $50,000 and weighing 50 pounds [00:02:18]. The [[creative approaches in winning prizes | objective]] was to hold the bag for as long as possible, with the first person to set their bag down losing it [00:02:31].

## Car Deadlift Challenge

A four-time World's Strongest Man was challenged to deadlift a Camaro [00:02:42]. If successful, he could keep the car [00:02:48]. The car was described as a real vehicle with a working horn [00:03:03]. The strongman successfully lifted the car, demonstrating his immense strength [00:03:17]. However, a humorous twist occurred when he attempted to sit in the car, finding it a surprisingly tight fit [00:03:48].

## iPhone Stacking Challenge

In a test of precision and nerve, a contestant was tasked with stacking as many new, unopened iPhones as possible within a tiny rectangle [00:03:53]. The stack could go as high as desired, but if it fell, the contestant would win nothing [00:04:24]. Each iPhone was valued at approximately $1,000 [00:04:12]. The participant initially stacked 14 iPhones [00:04:17] and eventually reached 32 iPhones, winning roughly $32,000 [00:04:51].

## Money Bench Press

A contestant named Frank was challenged to bench press as much money as he could [00:04:58]. Money was placed in a basket on a barbell, with each stack of $1,000 adding weight [00:05:03]. Frank aimed for at least 10 grand [00:05:10], eventually having $21,000 on one side of the bar [00:05:18]. He was offered the option to add up to $100,000 [00:05:25], but opted for a lower amount to ensure success [00:05:27]. After a struggle and some assistance, which led to a portion of his prize being confiscated, Frank successfully benched a significant amount of money [00:05:51].

## Laser Obstacle Course with Money

A contestant carrying a large amount of cash from the initial "money mountain" challenge was presented with a laser obstacle course [00:06:32]. At the end of the course were keys to a car [00:06:38]. The [[winning_strategies_in_contests | rule]] was that if the contestant touched a laser or dropped any money, they would lose all their cash [00:06:41]. The contestant attempted the course but stumbled, resulting in losing all the accumulated money [00:06:52].

## Ring Stacking Challenge

At a jeweler's, a female contestant was challenged to fit as many rings as possible on her finger [00:07:04]. The rings varied in value, including one priced at $7,300 [00:07:11]. She managed to fit numerous rings, accumulating $25,000 worth of jewelry on one finger [00:07:17].

## Orbeez Pool Money Dive

A pool filled with Orbeez contained hidden vacuum-sealed bags of $10,000 [00:07:33]. The contestant, Adam, had 60 seconds to find and retrieve as much money as possible, with $100,000 hidden in total [00:07:44]. Adam managed to retrieve $40,000 within the time limit [00:08:34].

## Sumo Wrestling for a Rolex

In a [[moneybased_competitions_and_incentives | money-based competition]] with a unique twist, a contestant had to predict the winner of a sumo wrestling match between two individuals, Chandler and Chris [00:08:43]. If their prediction was correct, they would win a Rolex watch [00:08:46]. Additionally, the winner of the sumo match would secure $10,000 for their mother [00:09:09]. The chosen wrestler won, resulting in the contestant winning the Rolex [00:09:29].

### Wresting for Kept Money

Later, two camera operators, Timmy and Tareq, who had been carrying $25,000 each for eight hours, were offered the chance to sumo wrestle for the right to keep their money [00:09:34]. The first to fall or leave the circle would lose their $25,000 [00:09:41]. Tareq ended up losing the match, and thus his $25,000 [00:10:01].

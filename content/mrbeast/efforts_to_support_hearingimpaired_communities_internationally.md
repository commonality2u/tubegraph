A significant initiative has been undertaken to help deaf and hearing-impaired individuals regain their hearing, aiming to assist 1,000 people initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This project has since expanded to include international communities, providing [[improving_hearing_for_deaf_individuals_through_technology | cutting-edge hearing technology]] and additional support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Providing Hearing Technology
The initiative involved acquiring over $3 million worth of [[improving_hearing_for_deaf_individuals_through_technology | cutting-edge hearing technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Unlike older hearing aids, this technology analyzes specific hearing needs, allowing individuals to hear without causing further damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Impact in the United States
Early efforts focused on individuals in the United States, with many experiencing profound moments upon regaining their hearing:
*   One individual heard her mother's voice for the first time in four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.
*   Others like Kayleah and Sudy were helped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   Entire families were able to hear their loved ones again, demonstrating the [[the_impact_of_hearing_on_family_relationships | impact of hearing on family relationships]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   A daughter expressed that her father's life was "saved" after he regained his hearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   Aisha was another early recipient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, who was overjoyed to hear her baby girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

Beyond providing hearing, recipients were also given [[charitable_giving_and_financial_support_for_hearingimpaired_individuals | financial surprises]], often $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. One recipient with 12 grandchildren received $12,000 to give $1,000 to each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Another family received a brand-new jet ski after mentioning their old one broke down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Younger patients also received personalized hearing aids, like custom pink ones for a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, and were taken on toy shopping sprees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. To test their new hearing, some recipients were given tickets to major events, such as a championship basketball game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a> or a Taylor Swift concert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## International Expansion
The efforts extended beyond the United States, becoming a [[charitable_initiatives_for_global_health | global health initiative]].
*   **Mexico**: 200 deaf people were helped in Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Leo Bardo and Selmai, for instance, heard their daughter's voice for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. One elderly woman who hadn't heard properly for 67 years regained her hearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **Other Countries**: The initiative also reached Guatemala <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>, Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, Malawi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, and Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, helping hundreds of people in these regions.

## Supporting Sign Language Education
It was recognized that providing hearing technology is not the only way to connect people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Sign language connects people regardless of their hearing ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Due to limited access to sign language education in many places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, a donation of $100,000 was made to organizations worldwide that are [[promoting_and_supporting_sign_language_education | teaching people sign language]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

In a challenge to build the [[building_the_worlds_largest_lego_tower | world's largest Lego tower]] for a $50,000 prize, participants utilized various tools and strategies, including heavy machinery, to achieve extreme heights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Role of Heavy Machinery

Heavy-duty machinery was provided to enable teams to construct towers as tall as desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This equipment facilitated the placement of Lego bricks at significant heights, which would be impossible or exceedingly difficult with manual labor alone.

## Introduction of the Crane

A crane was specifically mentioned as a piece of equipment that made the building process more engaging once it was finally put into use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The crane likely allowed for the efficient lifting and positioning of large sections or individual bricks as the towers grew taller.

## Other Construction Techniques

While the primary method involved adding bricks, teams also employed various [[strategies_and_challenges_in_constructing_tall_lego_structures | strategies and challenges in constructing tall Lego structures]], including reinforcement techniques:
*   One team considered going to a store to get "really long metal rebar and then quick dry cement" for reinforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   Another team physically added concrete to their bricks and poured it down the middle of their tower to harden the inside of the structure, aiming for better stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This was done to ensure the bricks stayed together better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

An unconventional [[tug_of_war_team_dynamics | Tug-of-War]] was conducted featuring a real military tank pitted against two school buses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The objective of the challenge was to avoid being dragged into a giant pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Setup and Safety Measures
Due to the dangerous nature of the experiment, no individuals were permitted inside the vehicles, as falling into the pit would be fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The tank was operated remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## The Challenge
The tank operator expressed confidence, stating, "I'm full throttled right now. You're done for!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Conversely, a participant on the bus team conceded, "Oh, we're screwed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The tank's [[tactics_and_decisions_by_participants | tactics and decisions by participants]] proved effective, leading to the rapid defeat of the buses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Outcome
The two school buses were ultimately dragged into the pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. After the buses fell, their horns could be heard beeping from the bottom of the pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. An investigation confirmed the buses were indeed at the bottom of the pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Diamond or Mystery Cheque Challenge
In one competition, a participant named John was given the choice between a $38,000 diamond ring and a mystery cheque with a covered amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. John chose the guaranteed ring, stating it was "guaranteed" money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. It was later revealed that the mystery cheque was for $100,000, meaning he missed out on a much larger prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This served as an early [[surprise_giveaways_and_prizes | surprise giveaway and prize]] with a significant twist.

## Guess the Jelly Beans for $1 Million
Another challenge involved guessing the number of jelly beans in a large jar for a chance to win $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Participants were not allowed to open the lid to gather intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. One contestant, Joe, guessed 72,368, but the correct answer was 8,171, making him way off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This was a classic example of [[games_and_conquests_with_highvalue_prizes | games and contests with high-value prizes]].

## Laying Solo Cups for Dollars
A participant named Andre was tasked with laying out red solo cups on the floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. For every cup laid, he received a dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. He had unlimited cups and the entire day to cover the room, with the option to stack them once the floor was covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Andre ended up laying 4,700 cups, which was rounded up to $5,000, showcasing a unique and lengthy challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. This demonstrated [[giving_away_items_in_unique_and_entertaining_ways | giving away items in unique and entertaining ways]].

## Breaking a Briefcase Out of Ice
Contestants were given a pickaxe and challenged to break a briefcase containing $10,000 out of a giant block of ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The number of swings depended on a number chosen between one and 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Grant had 15 swings but was unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Felix, another contestant, received 10 swings and managed to free the briefcase, earning the $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This is an example of a [[golden_ticket_contest_and_challenges | golden ticket contest and challenge]] format.

## Basketball Wall Challenge
This competition involved a wall of basketball goals, where contestants earned an item for every shot they made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. The catch was that if they missed a shot, they lost all accumulated items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Two brothers initially competed as a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. After one missed, they lost their MacBook Pro and Oculus Rift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Later, Chandler participated individually, successfully making multiple shots and accumulating various prizes like AirPods, Beats, an iPad, a Theragun, a MacBook, and an Oculus before eventually missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This is another instance of [[unique_contests_and_games | unique contests and games]] with high stakes.

## Pick the Race Winner
A participant was offered $10,000 if they correctly predicted the winner of a race between Carl and Chris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. If they picked the loser, they would get $0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. The participant chose Chris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Carl was also incentivized, being offered $5,000 if he won the race, creating an interesting dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Chris ultimately won the race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, resulting in the participant winning $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. This is a clear example of a [[unique_competition_formats | unique competition format]].

## Mystery Bucket Challenge
Three buckets were presented: one with mustard, one with slime, and one with money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Isaiah, the participant, had to assign Chris, Carl, and himself to a bucket, determining who would receive the contents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Isaiah assigned Chris to the yellow bucket, which contained mustard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Carl was assigned to the red bucket, which held slime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This left Isaiah with the blue bucket, which contained $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. This was a [[surprise_giveaways_and_prizes | surprise giveaway and prize]] with a messy twist.

## Relationship Challenge
Dubbed the first relationship challenge on the channel, a couple, Matt and Elizabeth, were separated and asked questions about their relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. If they provided the same answers, they would win a mystery prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Matt revealed his intention to propose to Elizabeth but had lost his job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. The prize was revealed to be $15,000 towards their wedding if they matched all answers, including the final question of Matt proposing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. They successfully matched answers, and Elizabeth accepted Matt's proposal, earning them the $15,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. This heartwarming competition was a unique blend of personal stakes and [[surprise_prizes_and_offers_for_participants | surprise prizes and offers for participants]].

## Pick the Car Challenge
A contestant was presented with two cars: one made of ramen noodles and a real Mini Cooper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. She chose the ramen car, believing it to be the better option due to its rims and "disconjumbled" appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Upon revealing her choice, it became clear she had picked the novelty ramen car, losing the chance to win the real Mini Cooper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. This was a humorous example of [[giving_away_items_in_unique_and_entertaining_ways | giving away items in unique and entertaining ways]].

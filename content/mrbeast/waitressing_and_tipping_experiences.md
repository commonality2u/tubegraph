This article explores the experiences of a waitress, focusing on her tipping history and a unique challenge involving stacking money.

## The Waitress's Tipping History
A waitress, who has been in the profession for five years, revealed that the largest tip she had ever received was $200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## The Money Stacking Challenge
In a unique challenge, the waitress was offered the opportunity to keep as much money as she could stack on a tray without letting it fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. If the stack collapsed, she would lose everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

Initially, the host added $8,000 to the tray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The waitress expressed that she didn't have a specific stopping number, intending to "keep goin' and see" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. She was allowed to call an end to the challenge at any point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Despite the precarious height of the money stack, she requested "one more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, then "three more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, and "another one on top" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> before finally calling a stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Coworkers' Experience
A few of her coworkers from the kitchen were watching the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The host invited them to their warehouse for a separate challenge, which they accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The host jokingly advised, "Don't follow strangers, kids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. These coworkers then participated in a different challenge involving [[giving_away_cash_and_prizes_to_restaurant_customers | filling bags with money]] within a minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The host also offered their boss a bag of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

A unique type of display featured in videos involves the use of hundreds of drones to create dynamic visuals in the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[04:49]</a>. These drone formations are capable of spelling out words or forming symbols that are visible from a mile away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[05:14]</a>.

### How it Works
The process involves a walkie-talkie system where whatever is spoken into it will be spelled out by the drones in the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[05:02]</a>. For example, when the word "Burger" was spoken, the hundreds of drones formed the word "Burger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[05:05]</a>. The drones can also be commanded to spell other phrases, such as "Cheese balls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[05:18]</a>, or even pre-selected symbols like the "gotcha" symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[05:29]</a>. The system allows for real-time interaction and overriding of commands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[05:33]</a>.

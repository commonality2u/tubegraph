From: [[mrbeast]] <br/> 

Viewers are actively encouraged to share and watch the video multiple times, as their engagement directly impacts the prize awarded to the winner of the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Prize Structure and Viewer Impact
The core [[incentives_and_motivations_in_challenges|incentive]] for viewers is that the winning participant receives $1,000 for every one million views the video accrues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This payment continues for the rest of the winner's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. For example, if the video gains another million views seven years later, the winner will receive an additional $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Every single view contributes to the winner's earnings, with each watch equating to one-tenth of a penny for the winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

## Calls to Action for Viewers
Both the host and participants make direct appeals to the audience to share and watch the video, emphasizing the benefit to the winner:
*   "Share the video. Watch it. Tell your dog, whoever you have to tell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.
*   Viewers are told they "can control their entire life" by spreading the word about the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.
*   The host encourages viewers to "watch this video a few times" so that whoever wins "deserves the extra money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>.
*   Viewers are asked to "watch this video multiple times so whoever wins gets lots of money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>.
*   Participants directly ask viewers to "watch the video and share it and like it and comment and subscribe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>.
*   Viewers are urged not to let the participants' "hard work go to waste" and to "watch this video a bunch of times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>.
*   The winner, Tareq, explicitly asks viewers to "please keep sharing this video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:00">[16:54:00]</a>.

## Motivation for Viewer Engagement
The explicit [[incentives_and_motivations_in_challenges|motivation]] for [[audience_participation_in_challenges|audience participation]] is to increase the prize money for the winner. The host posits that the video's entertainment value, which he argues is "better than a baby biting a baby's fingers," justifies it receiving over 875 million views, potentially leading to the winner receiving over $870,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.

The winning participant, Tareq, expresses his intention to give all his winnings to his parents, who "literally sacrificed everything they had" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00:00">[17:00:00]</a>. This personal motivation is shared with viewers, serving as an additional emotional [[incentives_and_motivations_in_challenges|incentive]] for them to contribute to the video's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00:00">[17:00:00]</a>. The prize is described as being "literally like winning the lottery" for the recipient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>.

A series of [[challenges_and_hiding_strategies | challenges]] were designed where contestants (referred to as "the boys") competed to open various safes, with the ultimate goal of winning a $100,000 cash prize for their dad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## The Decoy Vault

The competition began with a large bank vault stated to contain over $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The key was presented as the only way to open it, and the first person to touch the vault would win its contents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Chris was the first to reach and touch this initial vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. However, this first vault was a [[High stakes challenge strategies | decoy]] and contained nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This set the stage for a series of subsequent challenges.

## The Challenges

Participants had to navigate through various rooms and complete tasks, with each successful completion earning them the chance to open a different safe. The contents of these safes varied, with the grand prize of $100,000 hidden in only one of them.

### Laser Room 1

This challenge involved navigating a room filled with lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Nolan successfully completed this challenge due to his agility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, being described as "skinny and lanky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Winning this stage did not directly yield a prize but advanced them to the next task of carrying a mannequin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Red Solo Cup Room

The challenge in this room was to find a key hidden amongst over "1 billion" red solo cups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Chandler found the key in this challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The safe revealed that if the $100,000 prize was won, the dad would also receive a Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Falling Garage Door

Contestants were blindfolded and tasked with making it under a falling garage door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Karl successfully made it first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This safe awarded his dad $10,000 in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Lego Mountain

In this challenge, contestants had to use a mountain of Legos to build up and reach a key dangling in the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Chandler obtained the key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. The safe revealed that if he didn't win the *next* challenge, he would be kicked out of the competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This added a high-stakes element to the subsequent task.

### Laser Room 2

Similar to the first laser room, this challenge required precision timing to cross between disappearing and reappearing lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Chandler was the sole participant in this challenge, and if he touched a laser, he and his dad would be out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Despite the short duration between laser appearances, Chandler successfully navigated the room without touching any lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This safe contained "nothing," but Chandler avoided being kicked out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This challenge can be seen as a [[dangerous_escape_room_challenges | dangerous escape room challenge]] due to its high stakes.

### Electric Wires

A vault was "protected" by a "plunge of electric wires," though it was later revealed they only reacted to metal and were safe to touch, used as a scare tactic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Chris ran straight through the wires, touching the vault first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. However, due to perceived cheating, they moved on to the next room without opening this vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

### Voting Room

In this room, contestants voted for who they wanted to open the safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, with the rule that they could not vote for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Nolan won the vote with two votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. This safe yielded nothing, but advanced them to the next room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### Sand Pit

The challenge involved using a metal detector to find a key hidden in a giant beach/sand pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. The key was found but broke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. This safe awarded a $5,000 Home Depot gift card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## The Final Vault

The initial decoy vault was later filled with the $100,000 cash prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The contestants returned to the first room, with new obstacles like nails added to prevent climbing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. The goal remained the same: the first to touch the vault would win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

Nolan touched the vault first in the final round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. He successfully opened it to reveal the $100,000 cash prize, winning it for his dad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

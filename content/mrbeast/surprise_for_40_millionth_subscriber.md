In a grand [[surprise_giveaways_and_prizes | surprise giveaway]], the 40 millionth subscriber received all 40 cars from the host's collection, which included a Porsche, a Chrysler, a custom 40-million-wrapped Tesla, and even a SpongeBob car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The total cost of these vehicles exceeded $300,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Identifying the Subscriber
The host used YouTube's list of most recent subscribers, refreshing it upon hitting the 40 million milestone to identify and message the newest one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The recipient, Luke, was only told he had a [[surprise_prizes_and_offers_for_participants | surprise]] awaiting him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The 40 cars were loaded onto car haulers for a 10-hour drive to Luke's location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

Upon arrival, Luke was blindfolded, unaware that 40 cars were being offloaded onto his lawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. When the blindfold was removed, Luke was astonished by the sight of 40 cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## The Challenge: Give Away 40 Cars
Recognizing that Luke didn't need 40 cars, the host presented him with an [[extreme_challenges_for_subscribers | extreme challenge]]: if he could give away all 40 cars in under 24 hours, he would receive a custom-wrapped [[tesla_challenge_for_subscriber | Tesla]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The last nine cars were kept covered, making the challenge more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### The Giveaway Process
Luke began by giving cars to his family and friends:
*   His brother, Jake, received the first car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   His 10-year-old brother, Ben, received a car, with Luke driving it off the lot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   His parents selected a Grand Cherokee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   A friend received a Porsche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   Another friend, Carson, chose a Subaru <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   Some cars were given to his grandparents, who drove hours to get there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   His great-aunt received a car, expressing that she "needed a car just this size" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

Luke also extended the [[surprising_people_with_free_cars_and_merchandise | surprise gifts]] to people in his community and random strangers:

*   Random people at Walmart were approached and offered cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   At Zaxby's, a number-picking game determined a winner for a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. One college-bound recipient stated, "this was just a really perfect gift," highlighting the [[impact_of_surprise_gifts_on_recipients_lives | impact of surprise gifts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   Luke's dad's co-worker, Steve, who was considered highly deserving, received a good car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Steve was initially skeptical, thinking it was a prank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

### Unique and Wacky Cars
The challenge included unusual vehicles to make the giveaway more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>:

*   **Amphibious Car:** A vehicle designed to drive on both land and water, though it was non-functional and also contained money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
*   **Three-Truck Truck:** A unique vehicle consisting of three trucks glued together, given to a gamer who also received PlayStations hidden inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

### The Final Car
The final car to be given away was revealed to be a car previously owned by Karl, one of the host's team members, which the host had "destroyed" for a video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. Karl was tasked with unwrapping it for the last recipient, Little Jimmy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

## Challenge Accomplished

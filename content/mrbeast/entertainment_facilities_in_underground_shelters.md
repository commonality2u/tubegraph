The secure nature of these facilities, with multiple thick doors and [[security_measures_in_luxury_bunkers | surveillance systems]], ensures a safe environment for residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Residential units, such as those on floor 11, can cost between one and two and a half million dollars and can support up to 10 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

Alex participated in a challenge to live indefinitely inside a grocery store, earning $10,000 for each day he remained. The store was fully stocked, providing abundant resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. His daily earnings were contingent on him providing $10,000 worth of products from the store in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The challenge would end if he crossed a red line painted around the store's perimeter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Initial Setup and Adaptation

Upon entering, Alex quickly established a "home base" in a corner of the grocery store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. He cooked steak for his first meal, confident that with such provisions, he could easily stay for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. His initial strategy involved selling non-essential, expensive items like electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, followed by pet food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, and diapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

After ten days without showering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, Alex discovered the store's backroom and ingeniously constructed a makeshift shower and laundry system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. On day 13, he upgraded his shower using shelves and plastic liner for reinforcement and waterproofing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

For his living quarters, Alex built walls using all the water bottles in the store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. He also created a "pretty cozy" bed out of toilet paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Later, he replaced the water bottle walls with metal shelves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. He also found a forklift, significantly improving his efficiency in moving items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>, which allowed him to upgrade his bed yet again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## [[Psychological impact of isolation | Challenges of Isolation]]

Despite the comforts he created, the **[[challenges_of_isolation | challenges of isolation]]** began to affect Alex. Initially aiming for a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, he started documenting what he would spend the money on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. He soon realized he was missing out on time with his children, whose birthdays were approaching, and he had never missed one before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. This emotional toll caused him to revise his goal to $500,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. He even used a cardboard cutout of Jimmy (the challenge host) to combat loneliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

The environment took a turn for the worse when the electricity was cut off because the challenge host had not paid the bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. This meant freezers stopped working, lights went out, and the challenge became significantly harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Alex had to rush to sell all the frozen food before it spoiled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

Without power, Alex was deeply affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. The days started blending together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>, and the store began to feel like a "wasteland" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. He opened a dock door to let in daylight and get some fresh air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. He described himself as a "sad, old miserable boy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a> and lamented having "nothing to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. The proximity to the red line, symbolizing his freedom, became a daily temptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. He later found lanterns in the back, which helped light up his living space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

A significant setback occurred when Alex accidentally ruptured the pool he had set up using the forklift, flooding his living area and soaking his money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. This incident led him to state, "I'm done, man. I just want to leave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. His mood deteriorated further, with him considering leaving if he saw a spider in his bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

On day 44, feeling increasingly lonely and depressed, Alex was given his daily money by a robot, which underscored his isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. He felt so isolated that he believed "Not even Jimmy wants to come here for a minute. That's how depressing this place is now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. By day 45, he was visibly bored, stating he didn't know if he had "an hour left" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

## Conclusion

The emotional impact of missing his family, particularly seeing his wife and children for a brief visit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a> and later, his wife again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>, was a major factor in his decision. Alex ultimately concluded that staying was not worth it, despite having amassed $450,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. He ended the challenge on day 45, having spent 45 days in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>.

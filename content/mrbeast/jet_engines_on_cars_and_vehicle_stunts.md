Various [[creative_stunts_and_highrisk_video_challenges | creative stunts and high-risk video challenges]] and [[stunt_experiments_and_pranks | stunt experiments and pranks]] involving vehicles have been conducted, including strapping 10 jet engines onto a car, a tug-of-war between a tank and school buses, and driving a train into a giant pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Car with 10 Jet Engines
One notable [[stunt_experiments_and_pranks | stunt experiment]] involved attaching 10 jet engines to a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This was done to test if the car would fly 10 times further than a previous attempt where a single jet engine on a car jumped eight buses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

During the launch, the car was controlled remotely, and the operator was "matrix-ed into the car" to see what it saw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. The car successfully cleared all 12 buses and created a crater in the road upon landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. An engine block was found on the road, smoking and leaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## Tank vs. Buses Tug-of-War
Another [[unconventional_chase_scenarios_and_stunts | unconventional chase scenario and stunt]] involved a tug-of-war between a real military tank and two school buses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The objective was for the losing side to be dragged into a pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. People were not in the vehicles for safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, with the tank being controlled by a remote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The tank proved to be much stronger, pulling the buses into the pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. After the buses fell, their horns could be heard beeping from the bottom of the pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Car Bowling
As a [[stunt_experiments_and_pranks | stunt experiment]], cars were used as bowling balls to hit pins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
Specific attempts included:
*   An initial attempt where the car did not go straight and turned back towards the participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   A second attempt resulted in a "perfect strike" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   Another car had a "mind of its own" and kept going in circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, eventually nearly hitting the participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Train Into Pit
One of the "most insane experiments" involved driving a newly purchased train full-speed into a giant pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Mannequins were placed inside the train, including one in the cabin for statistical safety, and a Feastables bar was given a "front row seat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. The train successfully barreled into the pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. All mannequins inside the train did not survive the impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

## Mannequin and Car Drop in Pit
Prior to the train stunt, a pit filled with a thousand bouncy balls was used to test if a mannequin would survive being dropped into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. The initial mannequin missed the bouncy balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Another mannequin was dropped, and it also did not survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Subsequently, a car was also dropped into the pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

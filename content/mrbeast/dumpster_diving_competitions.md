A unique [[unique_competition_formats | competition]] involving two contestants, Chris and Weddle, engaging in [[Strategies for finding valuable items in dumpsters | dumpster diving]] to find the most valuable items over a series of 100 dumpsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The winner receives a [[Games and contests with highvalue prizes | cash prize]], initially $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, later increased to $12,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Competition Format

The competition follows a head-to-head format:
*   **Contestants** – Chris and Weddle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.
*   **Objective** – Find the most valuable items from 100 dumpsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   **Turns** – Contestants take turns selecting and searching dumpsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.
*   **Appraisal** – A professional appraiser assesses the value of each item found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
*   **Conditions** – Dumpsters can be empty or "extremely gross" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Ladders are provided for access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   **Special Dumpsters** – One particularly large dumpster counted as four, allowing both contestants to search simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

### The Appraiser

A key element of the [[unique_contests_and_games | challenge]] is the appraiser, who determines the monetary value of each retrieved item.
*   Initially, a dedicated professional appraiser is on-site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
*   At one point, the primary host takes over the appraisal role due to the appraiser's absence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

#### Chandler 2.0
Due to an upcoming surgery, Chandler, a regular participant, could not be physically present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. He participated via FaceTime as "Chandler 2.0" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   Chandler 2.0 appraised several items remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   He was given a $100 credit to allocate to either contestant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. To maintain [[competition_dynamics_in_scavenger_challenges | competitiveness]], he split the $100 evenly, giving $50 to each, resulting in a temporary tie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

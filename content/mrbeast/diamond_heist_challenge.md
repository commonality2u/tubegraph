The Diamond Heist Challenge is a competition where participants attempt to navigate various laser security systems to "steal" a $100,000 diamond, with the prize awarded to a chosen sibling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The challenge is presented as protecting the diamond with "the most advanced security system in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Challenge Mechanics

Participants begin the [[High Stakes Challenges | high stakes challenge]] with multiple "lives" (represented by hearts), losing one each time they touch a laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Losing all lives results in elimination from the competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

MrBeast frequently implements unexpected elements to increase difficulty or offer advantages:
*   **Hidden Extra Lives** MrBeast occasionally places extra lives for contestants to find, which can be picked up to regain a lost heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Penalties for Last Place** The last contestant to complete a stage may face a penalty for the next, such as being required to complete it on one leg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Stages

### First Laser Course

The initial stage involves navigating a dense grid of lasers. Karl, Nolan, Chris, and Chandler each lose a life in this segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Chris later finds an extra life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

### Diamond Relocation Stage

In an attempt to distract contestants, MrBeast moves the $100,000 diamond to a spot above the door, where it could technically be reached but is likely to be overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. He also places an extra life on the ground nearby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Nolan and Chandler manage to secure these extra lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### Elevated Jump Course

This course requires participants to jump onto a raised platform and over a laser beam. Chris and Chandler lose lives here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Nolan successfully clears the course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Karl's initial attempt appears successful, but a slow-motion replay reveals his leg touched a laser, resulting in a lost life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### Complex Laser Grid

This advanced laser course was designed by guest LazarBeam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, who stated he "wanted it hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Nolan, having the most lives, goes first and successfully completes the course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Handcuff Twist** LazarBeam also decides that Karl and Chandler must be handcuffed together for this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Despite the handicap, they manage to complete the course without losing a life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

### Flickering Laser Course

Before this stage, it is announced that the first person to successfully complete it will win their sibling an additional $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Nolan rushes through the course immediately, winning the bonus prize but losing a life because he didn't wait for the lasers to flicker, which would have made the course easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Chris also attempts this stage but fails, resulting in his elimination as it was his last life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### Balance Beam

The remaining contestants (Nolan, Karl, Chandler) face a wobbly balance beam, where falling off results in a lost life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Chandler, with two lives, attempts it first and loses one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Nolan successfully crosses the beam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Karl, with only one life remaining, falls off the beam and is eliminated from the competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

## Final Showdown

The final [[challenge to win 100000 | challenge to win $100,000]] pits Nolan against Chandler, both having one life remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. The objective is to reach the diamond using only two stools, without touching the floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Nolan quickly strategizes and uses the stools to move efficiently, reaching the diamond first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

## Winner

Nolan wins the [[challenge to win money | challenge to win money]], securing the $100,000 diamond (plus the earlier $10,000 bonus) for his sister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. MrBeast reveals that the diamond used in the challenge was a fake, but the real $100,000 diamond (actually $99,000) will be shipped to Nolan's sister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

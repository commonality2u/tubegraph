The game show format presented involves a series of increasingly difficult laser-based challenges, with ten initial contestants competing for a grand prize of $250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The entire competition takes place on a giant spaceship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. The core mechanic is elimination: touching a laser results in disqualification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The show's host emphasizes the [[high_stakes_challenges | high stakes]] at multiple points, noting that $250,000 is "on the line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> and that "the stakes are high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

## Challenge Formats and Rules

The [[challenge_format_and_rules | challenge format]] progresses through various levels, each with distinct rules and obstacles:

### Level 1: Initial Laser Obstacle Course

The first challenge is introduced as "the most insane laser obstacle ever created" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, comprising "dangerous and extreme laser mazes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.
*   **Objective**: Contestants must touch a box of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Elimination**: Touching any laser results in immediate loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This room is considered the simplest of all rooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, with subsequent levels becoming much harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Level 2: Closing Laser Walls

This level requires contestants to navigate a course and traverse a wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a> while "red laser walls close in on you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. The host states that this level is "difficult" and that they previously "didn't even get close to pass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. After the challenge, footage is reviewed to determine who hit a laser and was eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### Level 3: Moving Platforms and Balance Beam

This level involves a 10-minute timer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Objective**: Contestants must get onto a moving platform, walk across a balance beam, get onto another moving platform, and then jump to safety, all while avoiding lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. The balance beam is described as "wobbling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Level 4: Giant Death Beams

This level features "giant blue death lasers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Objective**: Contestants must reach the other side without touching any red lasers or being "cremated" by the blue death lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. A flash of light indicates when a death beam is about to fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

### Level 5: Laser Prison (Endurance Challenge)

This level introduces an endurance element with a 10-hour potential duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   **Objective**: Contestants are trapped in a "giant laser prison" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. At a random point within 10 hours, the lasers will turn off for exactly three and a half seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, during which they must run and touch the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This requires significant patience and quick reaction times after prolonged waiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. After 7 hours of waiting, at 5 AM, the opportunity is presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

### Level 7: Jumping Platforms with Added Challenge

Contestants are required to hold a bottle of Prime Hydration drink throughout this level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, with an additional $10,000 prize if completed successfully while holding the bottle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
*   **Objective**: Jump from platform to platform while avoiding floor lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. Lasers briefly disappear every 30 seconds, offering a riskier "running" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. The platforms get further apart as the challenge progresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

### Level 7 (Re-Entry): Tesla or $250,000 Decision

This stage presents a significant [[game_show_style_decision_making | game show-style decision]].
*   **Choice**: Contestants can either eliminate themselves and win a Tesla (valued at around $40,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>, or continue competing for the $250,000 grand prize with a 33% chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. The host highlights that choosing the Tesla means a guaranteed prize, while continuing for the money carries the risk of winning nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. All contestants choose to continue for the grand prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.
*   **Challenge**: Navigate a laser maze with "a billion lasers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. There are two paths, one of which is a dead end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>, and the space becomes "very, very narrow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. One contestant attempts to "break the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a> by jumping over laser walls and walking on the edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.

### Level 8: Friends' Lasers

This level features only three lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>, each placed by one of the host's friends: Nolan's "up and down" laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>, Tareq's "side to side" laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>, and Karl's laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. Contestants must run through this simplified but still challenging maze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.

### Final Level: Combined Mazes & Head-to-Head

The final level is a combination of "all the previous mazes into one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>.
*   **Objective**: Only one contestant will survive this level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>. The goal is to either touch the money first, or for the opponent to touch a laser first, leading to their elimination and an instant win for the remaining contestant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: Contestants are given 30 seconds to make a "massive strategic decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a> on how to approach the final maze. One contestant chooses to "play offense" and "send it" by running fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>, while the other considers standing still to wait for the opponent to make a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>. This highlights the [[strategies_in_highstakes_games | highstakes challenge strategies]] involved.
*   **Outcome**: The contestant who attempted to run fast hits a laser and is eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>, resulting in the other contestant winning the $250,000. The second-place contestant receives an additional $10,000 for their performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>.

Overall, the game demonstrates a progression of [[highstakes_physical_challenges | physical challenges]] combined with [[unique_competition_formats | unique competition formats]] and moments of strategic decision-making, all under the umbrella of significant monetary [[games_and_contests_with_highvalue_prizes | prizes]].

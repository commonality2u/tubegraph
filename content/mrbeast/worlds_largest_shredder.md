The world's largest shredder is a massive machine capable of demolishing various objects, including vehicles and large appliances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It was used in a series of experiments to test its destructive power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Shredding Demonstrations

Before attempting to shred a Lamborghini, several other items were put into the machine to demonstrate its capabilities:

*   **Piano** The shredder easily processed a piano, creating unusual sounds as it was destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Crates of Coke** Crates of Coke were sent into the shredder, resulting in an explosive reaction as the cans burst open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Hershey's Vending Machine** A Hershey's vending machine was fed into the shredder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. However, the machine became stuck, indicating that not even this massive shredder could easily "digest" it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
*   **Porta Potty** A porta potty was dropped into the shredder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, emitting an unpleasant smell during its destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

## Shredding a Lamborghini

The ultimate test for the world's largest shredder involved a Lamborghini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The car was dropped into the machine, which began to tear it apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. The process caused the building to shake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. At one point, the Lamborghini's tires got stuck, requiring a crane to push the vehicle further down into the shredder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Ultimately, the Lamborghini was completely shredded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. It was noted that the car had been decommissioned before being shredded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

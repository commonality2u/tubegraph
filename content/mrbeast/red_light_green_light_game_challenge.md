The "Red Light, Green Light" challenge was the inaugural game in a real-life recreation of the *Squid Game* series, where 456 initial contestants competed for a grand prize of $456,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Game Objective and Rules
Participants had a time limit of 30 minutes to cross a red line located on the opposite side of a massive room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The game followed the traditional "Red Light, Green Light" rules:
*   **Green Light:** Players could move freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   **Red Light:** Players had to freeze in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   **Elimination:** Any movement detected during "Red Light" resulted in immediate elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Each player was equipped with a device that would "pop" when they were eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

A "yellow light" was also introduced as a trick to eliminate a contestant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Progress and Eliminations
Early in the game, approximately 30 people were eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. As the game progressed, over 100 individuals were eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The first two players reached the finish line with four minutes and 20 seconds remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, soon followed by a total of five people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

As the clock ticked down to under one minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, many contestants were eliminated as they rushed to cross the finish line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Outcome
Out of the initial 456 participants, 232 successfully survived the "Red Light, Green Light" challenge and advanced to the next round of the competition for the [[challenge_to_win_money | $456,000 prize]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

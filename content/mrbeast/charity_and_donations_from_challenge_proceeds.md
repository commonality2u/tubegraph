During the "Last To Leave Grocery Store, Keeps It" challenge, all items "sold" by the participant, Alex, were donated to charity to ensure nothing went to waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This established a connection between the challenge's activities and [[Charitable donations in competitions | charitable outcomes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## Items Donated

Various types of products from the grocery store were part of the donations:
*   **Electronics** Alex initially selected electronics, as they were expensive and not useful for his survival in the store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Pet Food** On day two, Alex "sold" $10,000 worth of dog food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Produce** On day five, $10,000 worth of produce was sold and donated, particularly to prevent it from going bad quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Diapers** On day six, a large quantity of diapers was sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Miscellaneous Products** An additional $30,000 worth of products were cleared out and donated between days seven and nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Frozen Food** When the electricity to the grocery store was cut off, Alex had to quickly sell all the frozen food to ensure it could still be donated before spoiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

All these items were donated to charity, highlighting the philanthropic aspect of the challenge and ensuring that the large inventory of the purchased grocery store served a beneficial purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Game shows and challenges often incorporate elements of [[impact_of_surprise_rewards_and_twist_in_game_shows | surprise rewards and twists]] to engage participants and viewers. These unexpected changes, combined with explicit [[risk_versus_reward_challenges | risk-versus-reward challenges]], create compelling scenarios where individuals must decide whether to play it safe or gamble for a larger prize. The [[impact_of_surprises_and_moral_lessons_in_competitions | impact of surprises]] can significantly influence decisions and outcomes.

## Animal and Insect Challenges

### Bathtub of Snakes
Participants were challenged to sit in a bathtub full of snakes. The initial offer was $10,000 for their mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Chris immediately agreed and entered the tub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. As a twist, 20 more snakes were added to the tub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Chris successfully completed the challenge, winning $10,000 for his mom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Cockroach Money Box
A box containing $15,000 and giant cockroaches was presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Karl refused to participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Jeff, the sound guy, accepted the challenge to grab as much money as he could in 60 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. A surprise condition was added: an extra second would be granted if he petted a cockroach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Jeff managed to win $9,340 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Tarantula Crawl
Tareq was offered $10,000 for his mom if he allowed a tarantula to crawl on him for 30 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. His mom was present to cheer him on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. An additional [[surprise_prizes_and_offers_for_participants | surprise offer]] was made: the money would double to $20,000 if the tarantula bit him, though the host assured it wouldn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Tareq successfully completed the challenge, securing $10,000 for his mom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Rat-Infested Safe Room
A random contestant, Mary, was offered the contents of a safe if Karl could guess its code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. The twist was that every 10 seconds, a rat would be added to the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Hints were given, including a deceptive one about the code being under a giant rat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, and a true hint that the code was related to Karl's birthday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Karl eventually guessed the code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, revealing $20,000 and Chandler's stolen teddy bear inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Mary won the $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

### Bathtub of Pickles
Chandler, who is terrified of pickles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, was challenged to sit in a bathtub filled with pickles. Initially, the offer was $10,000 for his sister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. However, it was raised to $20,000 if he completed it within one minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Chandler, despite his fear, completed the challenge with his sister's encouragement, winning her $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Physical Endurance Challenges

### Dumbbell Curls
Noah was challenged to continuously curl a one-pound dumbbell, earning a dollar for every curl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. He could continue for as long as he wanted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. After accumulating $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, Chris purchased a Theragun to help Noah with his arm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, which was then used to massage his arm to enable more curls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Noah continued until he had earned $32,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

Noah was then presented with a [[risk_versus_reward_challenges | risk-versus-reward challenge]]: curl a 20-pound dumbbell. If successful, he would win an additional $20,000, bringing his total to $52,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. If he failed, he would lose his accumulated $32,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Noah chose to [[risktaking_and_its_consequences | risk it for the biscuit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, successfully curling the heavier dumbbell and winning the extra $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

### Push-Up Battle
Nolan, who had previously lost an $800,000 island to Karl in coconut bowling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, was given a chance for payback. He could win $8,000 (1% of the island's value) by beating Karl in a push-up battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Karl was incentivized with the $8,000 if he won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Nolan emerged victorious, winning the $8,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

## Mental and Social Challenges

### Script Reading
Randy was asked to read a nonsensical script in front of what he believed was an audience of a thousand people for $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. The script contained absurd statements like "why YouTube is better than everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. The surprise twist was that the "audience" was actually a thousand mannequins, with Chris and Karl hidden among them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Randy successfully completed the task and received the $10,000, expressing emotional gratitude for the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

### Painting Identification
Ashley was presented with four paintings, one of which cost $10,000, and the other three nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. If she guessed the $10,000 painting, she could keep it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. She initially picked a painting drawn by Chris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, technically losing the prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Feeling bad, the host gave her two more chances. Her second pick was the painting by Karl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, and her final pick was the painting by Chandler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. Ultimately, she failed to identify the $10,000 professional painting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This scenario demonstrates [[prize_distribution_and_surprise_outcomes | prize distribution outcomes]] where strategic choice is crucial.

## Strength Challenges

### Tug-of-War
Foy was given the opportunity to win $10,000 by playing tug-of-war against one of three individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. He chose Karl and won the initial $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

Foy was then offered a [[risk_versus_reward_challenges | double-or-nothing]] opportunity: risk the $10,000 to win $20,000 by pulling against two people, or lose it all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Foy chose to take the [[risktaking_and_its_consequences | risk]] and pulled against Karl and Chandler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. He successfully won the $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. He declined a further double-or-nothing challenge against all three individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, opting to keep his $20,000 winnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

## Blindfolded Challenge

### Popping a Balloon for a Car
Regina, blindfolded, was given a nail and told to pop a balloon hidden somewhere in the room within 60 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. The balloon contained keys to a brand new car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. The crew members intentionally moved the balloon around to make it more challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. Regina successfully popped the balloon while blindfolded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a> and won the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. This is an example of [[surprise_giveaways_and_prizes | surprise giveaways]].

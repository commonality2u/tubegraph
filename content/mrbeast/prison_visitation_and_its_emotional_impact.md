In a prison setting, the only way for inmates to see their [[family_or_friends | family or friends]] is through visitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. These visits can evoke a range of emotional responses from both the inmates and their loved ones.

## Experiences During Visitation

One inmate, Nolan, had a visit from his parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. His parents expressed disappointment, stating they "raised [him] better than this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a> and instructed him to behave for the remainder of his time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Nolan, in turn, displayed a defiant attitude, claiming he didn't "need to follow no rules" and that he "run[s] this place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. As the visit concluded, he attempted to escape and emotionally called out to his mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

Another inmate, Chris, received a visit from his son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Chris eagerly anticipated seeing his son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a> and expressed a wish to hold him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. The end of this visitation was particularly difficult for Chris, as he had "just got to see [his] son" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

### Unexpected Visitation
While others had [[family_or_friends | loved ones]] visit, Jimmy, an inmate who was in prison for a video, paid a lawyer to visit him without explaining the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. The lawyer was confused, as Jimmy wanted to stay in prison despite the lawyer being there to help him leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. The lawyer concluded that Jimmy "wants to be in there but I'm an attorney trying to get him out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

## Emotional Impact
The act of visitation, even in a simulated prison environment, highlights the profound emotional connections maintained despite confinement. The brief moments of connection can be powerful, evoking both joy and sadness due to the limited nature of the interaction.

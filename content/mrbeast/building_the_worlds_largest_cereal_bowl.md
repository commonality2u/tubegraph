A massive 2000-gallon bowl was constructed to be filled with [[using_powdered_milk_and_expired_cereal | powdered milk and expired cereal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The bowl was intended to become the world's largest bowl of cereal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, and was noted to smell like milk upon filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## The Cereal Bowl Challenge

The main purpose of the colossal cereal bowl was to host a "last to leave" challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Challenge Rules and Prizes

Four hosts, dressed as cereal mascots (Captain Crunch, Mr. Trix, Fred Flinstone, and Tony the Tiger), were tasked with finding random people in public to compete on their behalf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The last person to remain in the cereal bowl would win $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, and their partner (the host who recruited them) would receive $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Contestants

The four recruited contestants for the challenge were:
*   **Connor:** Recruited by Chris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>
*   **Ty:** Recruited by Chandler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>
*   **Scotch:** Recruited by Jake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>
*   **Becca:** Recruited by Tony the Tiger (the main host) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>

### [[experiences_and_challenges_in_the_cereal_bowl | Experiences and Challenges in the Cereal Bowl]]

Contestants faced various difficulties while sitting in the giant bowl:
*   **Initial Disgust:** One host who tested the milk described it as "disgusting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Physical Discomfort:**
    *   After 30 minutes, it felt like a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
    *   The contestants described the liquid as a "pool of pee, sugar, dried milk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
    *   Frequent urination was a common issue, with one contestant reporting five pees in two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, and another on number six without consuming much liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
    *   The environment became cold and smelly, especially after several hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. The temperature was predicted to drop to 58 degrees Fahrenheit, increasing the risk of hypothermia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.
    *   Some cereal became "soggy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>, and the air was filled with cereal dust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **Mental Fortitude:** Contestants initially expressed determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, but morale dropped as time progressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

### Partner Support

The partners attempted to provide support to their contestants:
*   **Food and Drink:** Water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, granola bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, Chick-fil-A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, sushi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, muffins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, bananas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, Gatorade, Powerade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, Rice Krispie Treats, Capri Suns, M&Ms, Honey Buns, Spinwheels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, orange juice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, steak and lobster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>, and Gushers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a> were brought to the contestants.
*   **Comfort Items:** Towels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, stools (some broke) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, floaties, pool noodles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, an inflatable neck pillow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, and books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a> were provided.
*   **Motivation:** Partners offered pep talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, led exercises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, and even threatened walking back to Florida if they lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### Eliminations

*   **Becca:** After six hours, Becca chose to leave due to being cold, tired, and the bad smell, stating her competitors were stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Ty:** After approximately 14 hours, Ty decided to get out, citing that the other contestants were not getting out soon and he "can't hang" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.
*   **Connor:** After over 14 hours, Connor left due to the cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

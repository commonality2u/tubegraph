In the real-life recreation of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory, several special guests were brought in to enhance the challenges and judge the [[Contestant experiences and eliminations | contestants']] performances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

## Professional Eaters: Matt Stonie and Joey Chestnut

Two of "the greatest eaters in the world," Matt Stonie and Joey Chestnut, were brought in to demonstrate the chocolate eating challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. They showcased how to "speed eat" the new Feastables milk chocolate and sea salt bars, providing a benchmark for the [[Contestant competition strategies | contestants]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. Their demonstration involved quickly consuming large quantities of chocolate, with Chris noting, "That's insane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. This set the tone for the challenge where the last team to eat their chocolate bars would be [[Contestant eliminations and reasons | eliminated]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

## Culinary Icon: Gordon Ramsay

For the final challenge to decide the winner of the chocolate factory, renowned chef Gordon Ramsay was introduced as a "special surprise guest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>.

### The Final Challenge: Dessert Cooking
The final challenge was a cooking competition, where the three remaining [[Contestant competition strategies | contestants]] had 45 minutes to create a dessert for Gordon Ramsay to judge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>. Ramsay judged on two criteria: "looks and taste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.

During the challenge, Ramsay frequently interacted with the [[Contestant competition strategies | contestants]]:
*   He questioned their cooking knowledge and methods, such as one contestant admitting they didn't know how to cook and were "just going for it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.
*   He advised them on time management, emphasizing the short 45-minute window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>.
*   He offered sarcastic commentary on their progress, like asking, "What's the dessert? Look at me, you've done nothing yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>.
*   He provided critical feedback, including on one contestant's technique, stating, "I don't think marshmallows whisk like that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>, and later remarking that a dish "looks like you cooked it, ate it, then threw it back up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.

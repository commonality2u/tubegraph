This article details a series of [[Stunt experiments and pranks | social experiments]] and [[Creative stunts and highrisk video challenges | challenges]] where individuals are given a credit card and told they can buy anything they want, but with a hidden limit; if they exceed this limit, they lose everything they picked out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The central twist of the [[Psychological Experiments and Human Limits | experiment]] is that the credit card actually has no limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This setup explores [[Participant reactions to unusual tasks | participant reactions]] to perceived risk and unlimited opportunity.

## Experiment Scenarios

### Target Store
In a Target store, which has a history of kicking out the creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, random people were given the "limited" credit card.
*   **Participant Estimation:** One participant initially thought the limit was around $200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Behavior:** The participants were very conservative, prompting the hosts to encourage them to spend more, even suggesting getting a TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Despite encouragement, they hesitated on purchasing two iPads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Outcome:** The total came to $5,915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Upon approval, one participant declared they would faint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The reveal that the card was unlimited left them in shock, with one stating, "This is insane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, and another calling it "the craziest thing that's ever happened to me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Lego Store
The next experiment took place at a Lego store, testing one of the hosts' social anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Behavior:** The participants were also cautious, initially picking a $350 item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. They were encouraged to "go big," eventually adding a Statue of Liberty set and the Millennium Falcon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Outcome:** The total reached $3,494.90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The participant expected the card to be declined due to past luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, but was excited when it was approved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Designer Store
At a designer store where items cost thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, a participant was given the card, and the store was even shut down for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Participant Estimation:** The participant estimated the limit to be $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Behavior:** They initially picked items like a $500 wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a> and an $850 hoodie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. They were encouraged to add more expensive items like $600 and $300 tee shirts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a> and $1,100 shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, all while trying to stay under their perceived $5,000 limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Outcome:** The initial total was $5,013.94, causing the participant to remove a shirt to stay under $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The card was approved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, leaving the participant "speechless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. His mother was reportedly more excited than him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. The reveal of no limit surprised him, though he acknowledged getting more than he wanted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### Art Gallery (First Date)
A couple on their first date was presented with the challenge in an art gallery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Participant Estimation:** The man initially guessed the limit was $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a> but then decided to keep spending below $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, expressing nervousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Behavior:** They considered pieces ranging from $4,500 to $30,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. They ultimately chose a piece for $7,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Outcome:** The total was $15,786.87 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. The card was approved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, allowing them to put a red dot on their chosen art pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The woman found the date "unexpected" but loved it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, and was "still in shock" afterwards, hoping for a second date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

### Jewelry Store
A man on the street was approached and given the card, leading him to a jewelry store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Motivation:** The man revealed his mother had Stage 4 cancer and he wanted to get her a necklace before she passed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Behavior:** He chose a necklace for his mother priced at $6,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, and was considering a pinky ring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. The jeweler offered a deal of all chosen items for $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Outcome:** The final total was $8,999.99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. The card was approved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The man expressed deep gratitude, stating he felt "so very blessed" to do something for his mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, and that the hosts "just made her year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

### Car Dealership
A known associate, Andre, was given the card and brought to a car dealership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Participant Estimation:** Andre initially guessed the limit was $10,000 or $11,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Behavior:** He looked at a Toyota priced at $15,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>, expressing nervousness about exceeding his perceived limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. He FaceTimed his partner of 25 years to share the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   **Outcome:** The total for the car was $15,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. The hosts revealed that car dealerships don't accept credit cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>, meaning the "no limit" rule was irrelevant, and they simply bought the car for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Andre was "completely flabbergasted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a> and deeply appreciative, encouraging them to "keep doing what you're doing because you're making a whole lotta people happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

### Best Buy
A woman was given the credit card at a Best Buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. The hosts got kicked out of the store during this segment, necessitating a switch to a smaller camera and more discreet filming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
*   **Participant Estimation:** She initially thought the limit might be $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>, but then estimated it at $4,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.
*   **Behavior:** She started conservatively with an $800 TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. She then considered a MacBook, bringing her total over $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. She added another MacBook Pro, reaching $3,380 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>, and later iPads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, along with a Nintendo Switch and three games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. The hosts encouraged her to get two iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.
*   **Outcome:** The total was $3,971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. She decided against an additional scan to stay under $4,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. The card was approved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>, making her "really nervous, really anxious," with her heart "beating really fast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. Upon learning the card had no limit, she jokingly asked to go back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

### Restaurant
A waiter was asked to participate in the challenge, where he could write any amount for the tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Participant Estimation:** The waiter found the idea of writing a $5,000 tip "absurd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
*   **Behavior:** He decided on a tip of $1,575 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   **Outcome:** The total, including the meal, was $1,999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. The card was approved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>, and the waiter was very thankful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

### Comic Book/Collectible Store
Another random person was given the card at a comic book and collectible store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.
*   **Participant Estimation:** He initially thought the limit might be $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>, then possibly $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.
*   **Behavior:** He was encouraged to fill a box with items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. He chose a Boba Fett shirt because of his tattoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a> and debated $3,000 statues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>, eventually choosing a Captain America statue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>, a Darth Vader mini-fridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>, and a Mandalorian Pop figure set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. The hosts acted as [[social_dynamics_in_group_challenges | bad influences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   **Outcome:** The total was $6,595 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.

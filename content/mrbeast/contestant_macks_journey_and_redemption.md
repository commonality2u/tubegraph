Mack, a fan-favorite [[contestant_experiences_and_eliminations | contestant]] from two previous challenge videos, was given a final opportunity to redeem himself and win an $800,000 prize by completing the "most deadly obstacle course in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, consisting of six progressively difficult levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Mack had tragically lost both his prior challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, including one where he lost $1.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. His [[contestants_motivations_for_winning | motivation for winning]] was not just personal redemption but also to help his childhood friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.

## Level 1: The Sky Jumps
The first obstacle course required Mack to jump between platforms hundreds of feet in the air without falling 200 feet to the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The final jump featured double swinging hammers and was the longest distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Despite initial fear and doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, Mack successfully completed the first level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, which was described as the easiest of the six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Level 2: Childhood Games, High Stakes
For the second level, Mack was elevated even higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. He had to choose between a balance beam or monkey bars, games from his childhood, to cross to the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The crucial rule change was that he had to remove his harness, meaning a fall would result in a 100-foot freefall into a net and the loss of the $800,000 prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Mack chose the monkey bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a> and, despite the intimidating height and the increasing difficulty of the gaps between bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, he successfully completed the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Level 3: The Memory Maze
Level three tested Mack's mental acuity rather than just his strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. He had 30 minutes to memorize a 44-tile pattern on the floor by pressing a red button, then cross the floor by only stepping on green tiles from memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Stepping on a red square would cause the prize money to explode, though Mack was provided a riot shield for protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

Mack struggled significantly with this challenge, taking nearly five minutes to make his first few steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. He continuously forgot the end of the pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. He was reminded that this was his "final chance" to win the $800,000, and losing again would mean no future opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Despite the pressure and being urged to restart and re-memorize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, Mack persevered. He made a final attempt with less than four minutes remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a> and successfully completed the memory maze right as the timer expired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

## Level 4: The Aquatic Obstacle Course
Level four was a challenging course over water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Mack was given a unique option: attempt the course once and lose everything if he fell, or hold a Feastables chocolate bar and gain unlimited attempts as long as he didn't drop the bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. He chose the Feastables bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, a [[contestants_decision_making | strategic choice]] that proved crucial as he fell immediately on the first two steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

Mack faced significant difficulties with the log roll and the "big red balls," which proved especially hard, causing him to fall "for literally hours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. It took him three hours just to get onto one of the balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. His persistence eventually paid off, and he completed the course while still holding the chocolate bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

## Level 5: Rolling Logs in the Sky
This level explicitly targeted Mack's past balance issues, as he had previously declined a balance beam and struggled with a rolling log obstacle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. He was tasked with crossing not one, but three rolling logs while carrying eight bags of money to the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. A single fall would result in losing everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. Before starting, the platform Mack was on was revealed to be 200 feet in the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>, increasing the psychological pressure.

Mack expressed deep fear, feeling like he was about to lose again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. He even thanked the host for the "third chance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. After successfully carrying some money across, he was given the choice to move on with the money he had or risk returning for more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. Despite the risk and initial hesitation, Mack chose to go back for the remaining $200,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. He made multiple trips, successfully bringing all $800,000 to the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. This showcased Mack's [[contestant_strategies_and_dynamics | determination]] and risk-taking.

## Level 6: The Ultimate Gauntlet
The final challenge was the most "insane obstacle course" of the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. Given Mack's past struggles with cookies in previous challenges (including losing $1.5 million to one) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>, he was offered a choice: attempt a small "umbrella cookie" for the $800,000, or attempt the giant, physics-defying obstacle course for the same prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. Mack, having "actual, legitimate nightmares about this cookie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>, chose to face the full course, symbolically throwing the cookie away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>. This decision highlighted his commitment to facing his fears and achieving full redemption.

The course included:
*   **Trapeze bars and platforms**: Mack successfully navigated these initial sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.
*   **The Wall of Death**: A vertical climbing challenge, still 200 feet in the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>. Mack's arms grew tired, but he conquered it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.
*   **Swinging obstacles**: Mack had to time his movements to avoid being hit by massive swinging hammers while crossing a balance beam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.
*   **Shrinking Cookies**: The final section involved four jumps between increasingly smaller "cookies" using trapeze bars, with 200 feet of free fall below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. This segment was designed to bring back Mack's past trauma with the cookie challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. Each jump was further and the cookies smaller, with the final jump being "twice as far as the previous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.

During the final cookie challenge, Mack almost fell multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. On his last attempt, with only seconds remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>, he nearly missed, but after a tense moment, he managed to secure himself on the final cookie, triumphing over his past failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>.

## Redemption Achieved
After three attempts, Mack finally completed the ultimate obstacle course and secured the $800,000 prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>. His reaction was one of overwhelming joy and relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>. He immediately stated his intention to use the money to help his three childhood friends who "don't have a lot of money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>, demonstrating the significant [[impact_of_winning_on_contestants_lives | impact of winning]] on his and others' lives. Mack declared that his life had "changed now" and "forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. His journey from repeated losses to ultimate victory exemplified his perseverance and the power of redemption.

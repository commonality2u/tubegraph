One of the challenges presented in the video involved participants [[facing_fears_for_a_cash_prize | facing fears for a cash prize]] by swimming among sharks to retrieve a sum of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## The Challenge
The participants were informed they were surrounded by "countless sharks," possibly even a thousand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. A backpack containing $100,000 in cash was placed in the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The objective was for a participant to retrieve the cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The prize money would then be given to their "number one fan," who was conveniently present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## The Attempt
Chris volunteered for this [[physical_feats_with_financial_rewards | physical feat]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. As he entered the water, the presence of sharks was evident, with one person exclaiming, "There's literally shark-look Tareq, Tareq, Tareq" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Chris was urged to retrieve the money quickly to get out of the water sooner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Outcome
Chris successfully retrieved the $100,000 cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a> and made it back to the boat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. He was then presented with the cash prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

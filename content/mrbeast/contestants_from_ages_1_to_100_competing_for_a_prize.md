From: [[mrbeast]] <br/> 

A unique competition featured 100 contestants, ranging in age from one to 100, all vying for a grand prize of $250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Unlike previous videos, the contestants themselves would ultimately decide who deserved the quarter-million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Each contestant began the [[unique_contests_and_games | challenge]] by entering their individual cubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The primary rule was simple: stepping outside the cube or touching a red line would result in elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Initial Stages and Early Eliminations

From the outset, middle-aged participants appeared to be the most focused and determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. As expected, the youngest contestants were among the first to be eliminated, including a two-year-old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> and others, along with some older individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Within the first hour of filming, six people had already been eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This competition focused on building friendships and convincing others to like you, as the contestants would ultimately decide the winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### First Major Challenge: Voluntary Exit or Random Elimination

After an hour, contestants were informed they needed to voluntarily eliminate 10 people within 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Failure to do so would result in a random elimination of 25 participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Despite pleas and attempts to convince older or younger participants to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, only one person (Contestant 89) volunteered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

Due to the group's inability to reach an agreement, a random selection machine was used to eliminate 25 contestants, one by one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This [[contestant_experiences_and_eliminations | elimination]] round was described as "brutal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. After this onslaught, 67 contestants remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### Second Major Challenge: Captain's Dilemma

By Day Two, only 55 contestants remained due to voluntary exits overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The next challenge involved a unanimous vote: if all remaining contestants could agree on a single winner, that person would instantly receive the $250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. However, if even one person disagreed, a new challenge would commence with more eliminations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. As expected, they failed to agree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

For the subsequent challenge, each row of contestants had to choose a captain to represent them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. These captains were then offered increasing sums of money. If a captain accepted the money, they and their entire row would be eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Initial offers of $1,000 and $5,000 were rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. When the offer reached [[challenge_to_win_100000 | $100,000]], Contestant 30 accepted, leading to the elimination of everyone in the 20s and 30s rows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, despite having previously stated they intended to "go the whole way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This act of [[contestant_strategies_and_dynamics | betrayal]] was met with shock and anger by the eliminated contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### Third Major Challenge: The Spinning Wheel and Strategic Eliminations

Following the betrayal, the remaining contestants from the 40s formed a strong alliance, vowing to stick together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. Another attempt at a unanimous vote failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, leading to a new challenge involving a spinning wheel with all remaining contestants' ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

With 36 contestants left, the goal was to eliminate 16, leaving a final 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. When the wheel landed on an age, that person's fate (elimination or safety) was decided by the person whose age was previously selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This [[creative_rules_for_winning_prizes | unique contest rule]] meant the decider could choose to keep control by eliminating others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. The 40s alliance, particularly Contestant 43 under the influence of 42, used this power strategically to eliminate non-alliance members, ensuring they retained control of the wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

Notable [[contestant_experiences_and_eliminations | eliminations]] in this round included:
*   Contestant 55, who gracefully accepted elimination, stating he would do the same if in the decider's position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   Contestant 11 (Gio), who made an emotional plea to stay but was eliminated by 43, leaving everyone "speechless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. The host compensated Gio with an appearance on stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.
*   Contestant 100, the oldest participant, who was eliminated despite a heartfelt request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. The host provided him with $20,000 for his participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

This round generated significant animosity, with the 50s vowing to target the 40s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. The general sentiment was to "trust no one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

### Fourth Major Challenge: Solo Winner Takes All

With 20 contestants remaining, another unanimous vote failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. The next challenge offered $250,000 immediately to *only one* person if they voluntarily stepped out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. If more than one person stepped out, all who did would win nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. The cubes were blacked out to prevent communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

Contestant 42 loudly declared his intention to step out, hoping to deter others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. For much of the allotted time, he was the only one who had left his cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. However, with two seconds left on the timer, another contestant (from the 50s) also stepped out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. This meant both were eliminated and won nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.

### Fifth Major Challenge: "Deal Or No Deal" Style

Still unable to agree on a winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>, the remaining contestants faced a challenge inspired by "Deal Or No Deal," hosted by Howie Mandel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>. Eighteen briefcases were presented, half containing "eliminated" and half "safe" signs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>. One contestant picked a briefcase, then another contestant had the option to either steal that briefcase or pick a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. The contestant with the chosen briefcase would reveal its contents, determining their fate. This challenge became a test of trust and deception.

Examples of [[contestant_competition_strategies | contestant strategies]] included:
*   Contestant 14 honestly revealed his case was "safe," leading to it being stolen by 41, who then was also "safe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. This reduced the odds of others.
*   Contestant 14 then claimed his next case was "eliminated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>, and it indeed was, leading to his elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. He felt he did the "right thing" by being honest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.
*   Contestant 48 lied, claiming his case was "eliminated" when it was "safe," successfully getting his opponent to not steal it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.
*   Contestant 54, when faced with elimination, was honest about her "eliminated" case, but her opponent (Contestant 67) chose to steal it, sacrificing himself because he wanted the best for her and to "see my grandchildren" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. This was hailed as a "selfless thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>.
*   The 96-year-old contestant lied about having an "eliminated" case, when it was "safe," ensuring his survival to the final nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>.

After this brutal round, only nine contestants remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>.

### Sixth Major Challenge: Justification and Group Vote

On the final day, trust among the remaining contestants was extremely low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. Since they still couldn't agree on a winner, they were tasked with eliminating four more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>. Each contestant presented their personal [[contestants_motivations_for_winning | motivations for winning]] the prize money, often sharing emotional stories about family or health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>. After hearing everyone's stories, they had to collectively decide who to eliminate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

The voting process was difficult and led to the elimination of contestants 61, 46 (breaking the 40s alliance), 96, and 72 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>.

### Final Challenge: The Grand Cube

With five contestants left, they entered a single large cube for the final challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>. The twist was that they would determine the winner themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>. An hour was put on the clock, and if more than one person remained in the cube when time ran out, the $250,000 would be burned by flamethrowers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>.

The contestants debated how to proceed, with suggestions ranging from voluntary exits to sharing stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>. Ultimately, they decided on a [[contestants_decision_making | ranked-choice voting]] system proposed by Contestant 48 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>. Each person ranked the others based on who they thought most deserved the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.

The results of the ranked-choice voting determined the winner:
*   Contestant 56 was in fifth place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>.
*   Contestants 41 and 64 tied for third place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>.
*   The final decision came down to Contestants 47 and 48, who had maintained the strongest alliance throughout the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>.
*   Contestant 48 came in second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.
*   **Contestant 47 was declared the winner of $250,000** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>. She was praised for her difficulty in eliminating others, building strong alliances, and fighting for those around her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>. The other four finalists each received $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>. As a final surprise, Contestant 47's son, who she had mentioned needing help, joined her in the cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>.

Mack, a contestant who previously lost $800,000 in a challenge, faced a new fear-based challenge to win back his money: being buried alive in a coffin for 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. This specific challenge was based on one of the host's own scariest experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>.

## The Challenge Setup
The goal for Mack was to remain in the coffin for at least 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. If he chose to exit before that time, he would lose all his remaining prize money, which stood at $700,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. A bell rope was placed above his head, which he could pull to signal his desire to be dug up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>. Mack was not given any way to track the time himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] High Stakes
> "If you leave before the 24 hour mark, you'll lose everything." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>
> "And if it does not say above 24 hours, you lose everything." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>

## Conditions and Initial Reactions
The coffin itself felt "freaky" and was described as "from my nightmares" by Mack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>. It was expected to get "a little cold" inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>. Mack expressed immediate discomfort, stating, "No way, dude" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>, and later asked to be buried faster due to the unsettling feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>.

To ensure Mack's safety during this period of [[living_conditions_in_extended_isolation | extended isolation]], he wore a wristband that directly relayed his heart rate and other vital signs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>. This device did not, however, provide any time information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>.

## Mack's Strategy and Reality
To combat the significant [[challenges_of_isolation_and_confinement | challenges of isolation and confinement]] and track time, Mack devised a strategy: stay awake for two hours, then attempt to sleep for ten hours, repeating this cycle to reach the 24-hour mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>.

However, the reality of the situation quickly set in:
*   **Boredom** Mack became bored "pretty obvious he was quickly getting bored" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>, recognizing there wasn't much to do inside the coffin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>.
*   **Time Distortion** Within 45 minutes, Mack's perception of time was "horrendously off," as he believed two hours had passed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>.
*   **Disrupted Sleep** While sleeping was intended to pass time, Mack found it difficult to stay asleep for more than 30 minutes at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>. He was also intentionally woken up by the host, echoing a past experience of the host's own [[surviving_seven_days_buried_alive | burial challenge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>.

## Physical and Psychological Toll
As the hours passed, Mack's awareness of time worsened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>. The [[solitary_confinement_challenges | claustrophobia]] became intense, leading him to state, "Being in this coffin is scary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>. He felt progressively worse the longer he remained confined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Coping with Confinement
> Mack described the feeling as "a crazy feeling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>. Physically, he experienced loss of blood flow in his legs and felt his back "going to fall out of [his] body" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>. These are common [[coping_mechanisms_in_solitary_confinement | challenges of isolation]].

Despite the growing discomfort and his rising nervousness, Mack remained committed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>. He understood the gravity of his decision, especially having lost a significant amount of money in a previous challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>.

## Successful Completion
Eventually, after a period of intense suspense, Mack decided to pull the bell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>. Upon being dug up, it was revealed that he had spent **36 hours** buried alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>. This far exceeded the 24-hour requirement, allowing him to pass the challenge and retain his $700,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:24:00">[16:24:00]</a>. He later acknowledged that he did not "feel well in here" and found the experience far more challenging than the host's previous seven-day burial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>.

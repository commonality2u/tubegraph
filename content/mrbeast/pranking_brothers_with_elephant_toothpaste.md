A prank involving filling a brother's house with [[elephant_toothpaste_experiment | elephant toothpaste]] was executed as a counter-prank for an [[executing_a_sticky_note_prank | ongoing sticky note prank]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The objective was to surprise the brother, CJ, with a brand new house after his was filled with the substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This elaborate scheme was dubbed "Prank Inception" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## The Setup and Motivation

The prank was initiated because CJ was planning to cover Karl's house with sticky notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. To keep CJ unaware of the counter-prank, Karl was led to believe that Brady's house was the target for the sticky notes, effectively using Brady as a cover-up for the real target, Karl's house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. CJ was under the impression he was pranking Karl, but he was actually the one being pranked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Elephant Toothpaste Preparation

Elephant toothpaste is created by mixing hydrogen peroxide with potassium iodide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The prank aimed to use a massive quantity, stating that even a small amount can result in a significant reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The team had enough materials in barrels to fill five houses, though they would use less for CJ's single house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

To ensure success on such a large scale, YouTube personality Mark Rober, an expert in [[achieving_an_elephant_toothpaste_world_record | elephant toothpaste]] with two world records in the field, was brought in to assist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Initial Tests

A preliminary test was conducted in the bathroom of CJ's house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This test resulted in a "wave of heat" and considerable foam, which reached the ceiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Participants were advised to "get far away" due to safety concerns, a protocol that was initially violated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. For the main event, the plan was to be 30 houses away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## The Grand Prank Execution

The plan was to unleash all the [[using_elephant_toothpaste_in_pranks | elephant toothpaste]] as soon as CJ pulled into his driveway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. The amount of hydrogen peroxide used for the prank was 500 gallons, nearly doubling the existing world record of 290 gallons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Fourteen large drums of elephant toothpaste were prepared for deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### The Reveal
Upon arrival, CJ was surprised to see his house engulfed in foam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. The foam was so powerful that it erupted from the chimney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Chris and Mark Rober were given permission by CJ to break the front window to enter the house, which added to the dramatic reveal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The foam inside was described as "hot" and "steamy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Aftermath and Resolution

After the prank, CJ was told he had been pranked on both MrBeast's channel and his brother's channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. To compensate for the significant damage caused by the [[stunt_experiments_and_pranks | prank]], which was acknowledged as more damaging than sticky notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>, CJ was gifted a brand new house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. A team was also committed to working "around the clock" to repair and fix CJ's old house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

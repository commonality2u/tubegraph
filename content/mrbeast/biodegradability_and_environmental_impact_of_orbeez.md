The creators of a large-scale Orbeez experiment addressed concerns regarding the environmental impact of using 100 million Orbeez in a backyard setting.

## Biodegradable Nature
The Orbeez used in the experiment are stated to be biodegradable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

## Cleanup Efforts
Following the [[massive_orbeez_experiment_putting_100_million_orbeez_in_a_backyard | massive Orbeez experiment]], there was an intention to pick up all the Orbeez used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, with the understanding that they were "supposed to be, like, picking up the Orbeez" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

## Impact on Wildlife
For any Orbeez that might not be collected, it was clarified that they are "not bad for squirrels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>, noting the affection for squirrels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

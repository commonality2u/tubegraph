This video features a series of [[youtuber_competition_challenges | YouTuber competition challenges]] with a Lamborghini as the grand prize, alongside a substantial cash reward. The contestant, Blake, who had previously appeared in two videos, faces a "third and final attempt" to win the grand prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. His goal is to protect a quarter-million-dollar Lamborghini from various extreme destruction attempts over four phases, culminating in a train impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The total prize for Blake includes the Lamborghini and an additional $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Phase 1: 10,000 Bullet Barrage

### The Challenge
Blake is given 24 hours to build a defense for the Lamborghini against 10,000 bullets fired by eight soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### Blake's Strategy and Execution
Blake immediately purchased $78,000 worth of supplies, including cinder blocks, shipping containers, refrigerators, junk cars, a water truck, and a CONEX crate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. His initial plan involved a wall of cinder blocks, followed by shipping containers filled with refrigerators, and then a wall of cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. He worked through the night and into the next morning, upgrading his defenses with railroad ties and even stuffing a van and a giant tube into a storage container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. His final defense included concrete in the front and a tall wall in the center to block "crow's nest machine guns," along with cars in storage containers and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Outcome
Despite initial skepticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, Blake's defense successfully protected the Lamborghini. After 10,000 rounds were fired, there were "no bullet holes" in the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## Phase 2: 100-Foot Free Fall

### The Challenge
The Lamborghini is lifted 100 feet by a giant crane, and Blake has 24 hours to build a mechanism to catch it without destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This represents a significant [[high_stakes_challenges | high stakes challenge]] and a [[creative_challenges_for_entertainment | creative challenge for entertainment]].

### Blake's Strategy and Execution
Initially, Blake was unsure how to approach the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Inspired by a construction worker's suggestion of "bouncy castles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, his master plan involved arranging CONEXes in a square and filling the enclosed space with air mattresses, pillows, bubble wrap, and bouncy castles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. He sent his crew to buy every pillow and air mattress in the city, working through sleep deprivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. The final setup included three bouncy castles, 150 mattresses, 150 pillows, and 2,000 cardboard boxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

### Outcome
The Lamborghini survived the 100-foot drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. An appraiser determined that the car sustained only a "little crack in the bumper," reducing its price by approximately $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

## Phase 3: Flaming Cars

### The Challenge
Blake faces a recreation of a past challenge that previously cost him $500,000: protecting the Lamborghini from flaming cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This time, the [[high_stakes_challenges | stakes are doubled]] with twice as many cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

### Blake's Strategy and Execution
Blake focused on using non-flammable materials. His plan involved cutting the bottom out of one shipping container to surround the car and then using two more containers to form a "V" shape above it, designed to deflect the falling cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. He specifically had his crew remove all wood from the container, as it was the cause of his previous failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. The containers were carefully lowered over the Lamborghini to avoid any scratches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Dirt and concrete were also added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

### Outcome
The Lamborghini survived the impact of 10 flaming cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. The protective crate, however, was heavily damaged, bending and bowing under the weight and heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

## Phase 4: Train Impact

### The Challenge
The final and most deadly attack involves a massive train barreling down the tracks towards the Lamborghini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. This is arguably the most [[unconventional_chase_scenarios_and_stunts | unconventional chase scenario and stunt]] of the series.

### Blake's Strategy and Execution
Blake's [[high_stakes_challenge_strategies | high stakes challenge strategy]] was to derail the train <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. He stacked railroad ties, concrete, the cars from phase three, shipping containers, mattresses, and water tanks on the tracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. He aimed to lift the train just "two inches off the track" to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. The train was backed up to gain significant speed, reaching 35 miles per hour before impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.

### Outcome
Blake successfully derailed the train <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. The Lamborghini survived the impact, securing Blake the grand prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. Blake won both the Lamborghini and $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.

The video featured product placements for Feastables chocolate bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a> and the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra phone, highlighting its 4K slow-motion, camera quality, Photo Assist, and Circle to Search features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. The Circle to Search feature was specifically noted as useful for Blake to have learned about the flammability of wooden railroad ties, a mistake from a previous challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

In a high-stakes [[hide_and_seek_game_setup_and_strategy | hide-and-seek game]] with a military squad, various strategies were employed to evade capture and win a $150,000 prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

## Initial Evasion Tactics

Upon the start of the hunt, immediate [[escape_tactics_and_evasion_techniques | evasion techniques]] were used:
*   **Pre-positioned Vehicle**: The target's car was purposely placed further away from the military squad's landing zone to gain a head start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   **Bridge Demolition**: A strategic bridge was blown up to cut off the quickest escape route for the pursuers, forcing them to take a longer way and granting the target a five to ten-minute head start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Diversion and Deception

[[creative_hiding_strategies_and_outcomes | Creative strategies]] were used to confuse the military squad:
*   **Warehouse of Decoys**: An entire warehouse was rented and filled with multiple jeeps. When the pursuers arrived, drivers were instructed to drive the jeeps in random directions to create confusion about the target's actual vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **In-Vehicle Concealment**: While inside a vehicle in the warehouse, the target reclined the seat and hid under a blanket to avoid detection as the pursuers entered the building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Doors were also locked for added security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Tracker Jamming**: A special bag was used to jam the GPS tracker, temporarily disabling the military squad's ability to locate the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Human Decoy**: A friend, Nolan, was buried alive with the tracker to act as a decoy, misleading the military squad into thinking they had found the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Nolan also engaged in phone conversations pretending to be the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Verbal Misdirection**: The target made false claims, such as being buried alive, to throw off the pursuers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Friend as Distraction**: Another friend, Karl, distracted the military squad by pretending to join their team and later moving their vehicle to clear an exit route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Karl also tried to mislead the squad about the target's location within the museum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

## Environmental and Positional Hiding

[[strategies_and_hiding_spots_in_large_areas | Strategic hiding spots]] and environmental elements were used:
*   **Remote Barn**: An old barn specifically constructed for the challenge was used as a temporary refuge in the middle of nowhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Rough Terrain**: Driving through rocky terrain was attempted to disable or slow down the pursuers' vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This tactic, however, failed as the military squad successfully navigated the rocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Hiding in the Woods**: The target and a friend hid in the woods to avoid detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, with the target laying low on the side of a path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Museum as Final Hiding Place**: An entire museum with multiple floors was rented as the final hiding location, offering numerous places to conceal oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   **Concealment within Exhibits**: Within the museum, the target hid in a corner and covered themselves with a jacket and a makeshift rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. The lights were also cut to increase concealment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## Negotiation and Time Management

*   **Bounty Negotiation**: The target negotiated with the military squad, offering to increase the prize money from $100,000 to $150,000 in exchange for a ten-minute head start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. The squad agreed, and even got ice cream during this pause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

Despite these [[challenges_and_hiding_strategies | strategies]], the target was eventually found in the museum due to their shoes being visible from under the rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. The military squad, upon winning, donated the $150,000 to the HunterSeven Foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

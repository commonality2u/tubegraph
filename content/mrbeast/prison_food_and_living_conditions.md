Participants in the experiment were subjected to the living conditions of a [[experiencing_maximum_security_prison | real prison]] for 50 hours, being [[experiencing_maximum_security_prison | treated exactly like inmates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This included eating real prison food, having to mop and clean the prison, and experiencing the [[psychological_effects_of_longterm_confinement | mental warfare]] associated with being a prisoner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Living Conditions
Upon arrival, the immediate living conditions proved challenging:
*   **Beds** The beds were described as "very uncomfortable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, with sheets that felt "oddly" unpleasant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. One participant compared sleeping on the bed to laying a blanket in the middle of the road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Mattresses were also flipped on their side during cell searches, making them difficult to put back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Toilets** The toilets were noted to have a "yellow tint" and were generally described as "disgusting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Water Fountains** Water from the fountain was found to contain "stuff" in it, leading one participant to prefer not drinking water at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Hygiene Facilities** Showers were available but lacked hot water, which was considered a form of torture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Toothbrushes provided were small and impractical, resembling a "sorry excuse" for a toothbrush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. After one participant experienced a hot shower, they felt significantly better, highlighting how simple amenities can "literally change the course of your whole day" in prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Roll Call** Guards conducted roll calls in the middle of the night to ensure no prisoners had escaped, which involved loud alarms and guards waking inmates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Cell Checks** Guards performed cell checks to find any contraband, with anything found potentially leading to a ride-up or even [[solitary_confinement_challenges | solitary confinement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **General Atmosphere** The objective of prison was perceived to be making inmates "feel like an animal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. The constant routine of being woken up and moved around made participants "sick of this place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. The experience was described as not fun, but rather an environment that makes inmates "upset" even after a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

### Recreation and Outdoor Access
Recreation time was provided, featuring a "crappy chessboard," a TV, and a "beautiful library" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Good behavior led to more rec time, while bad behavior could result in being cuffed and forced to clean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

Access to an outdoor courtyard with grass was considered a "massive blessing" and "very liberating," as it allowed participants to momentarily forget they were prisoners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

### [[interactions_with_guards_and_other_inmates | Interactions with Guards and Other Inmates]]
Guards were strict, using phrases like "Lights out, get in your bunk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a> and waking inmates abruptly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Inmates were required to wear constricting handcuffs when moving between areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Participants also learned to clean the prison as part of their duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

When other inmates started a riot due to perceived favoritism and flooded their cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, guards cuffed them and made them clean the floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. One inmate was sent to [[solitary_confinement_challenges | solitary confinement]] for possessing a knife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## Prison Food
The food provided was described as "real prison food" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Meals** The first prison meal received a rating of "four out of 10" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a> and was considered "bland" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Participants prepared meals for others when on kitchen duty, which included "tons of beans" and "cosmic brownies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. The final meal in prison consisted of "wieners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   **Boredom and Gambling** Due to the [[psychological_effects_of_longterm_confinement | boredom]] of the environment, inmates resorted to gambling their brownies during meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Impact** One participant noted that while the prison food might appear more fun in the video, it gets bland "really fast," and they "couldn't imagine [[psychological_effects_of_longterm_confinement | living years in prison]]" with such food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

## [[prison_visitation_and_its_emotional_impact | Prison Visitation]]
Inmates were allowed to see family or friends through [[prison_visitation_and_its_emotional_impact | visitation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. These visits were emotionally impactful, especially for those seeing young children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. The visits were brief, with guards abruptly ending them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

While spending 24 hours in the [[surviving_at_sea_in_the_bermuda_triangle | Bermuda Triangle]], participants experienced significant struggles with seasickness. Initially, the group expressed concerns about the dangers of the location, including making wills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. However, the primary challenge encountered was severe motion sickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.

## Initial Symptoms and Impact
Upon entering the [[surviving_at_sea_in_the_bermuda_triangle | Bermuda Triangle]], the water was rough, leading to immediate and widespread seasickness among the participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. One participant, visibly unwell, stated, "Does any part of me look okay right now?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. The severe discomfort prompted a request to the captain to find calmer waters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

### Attempts at Mitigation
The captain moved the [[experiences_and_challenges_on_different_yacht_tiers | yacht]] to a "little bit calmer waters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. This adjustment brought some relief, with one participant noting, "I'm doing better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. However, the respite was temporary, with the expectation of returning to the rougher conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Severe Nausea
> One participant reported having "threw up 11 times" due to the seasickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

## Persistent Discomfort
Despite temporary relief, seasickness remained a significant issue throughout the 24-hour challenge. Nearing the end of the trip, as the [[experiences_and_challenges_on_different_yacht_tiers | yacht]] headed back, the waves returned, causing further nausea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>. Participants again expressed feelings of being sick, with one stating, "I'm going to throw up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a> and another adding, "I feel like I'm going to throw up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
Ultimately, the experience highlighted that the primary danger encountered in the [[surviving_at_sea_in_the_bermuda_triangle | Bermuda Triangle]] for the participants was not mysterious disappearances, but rather the debilitating effects of motion sickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.

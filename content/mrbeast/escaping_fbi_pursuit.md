In a high-stakes challenge, Jimmy and his accomplice Tareq embark on an elaborate escape from an FBI agent and his team, with the agent set to keep $100,000 if he captures Jimmy before midnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The pursuit incorporates numerous [[unconventional_chase_scenarios_and_stunts | unconventional chase scenarios and stunts]], complex obstacles, and [[strategic_disguises_and_getaways | strategic disguises and getaways]].

## Initial Escape and Obstacles
The escape begins with Jimmy and Tareq fleeing through a wooded area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> to a waiting getaway car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Jimmy reveals he has meticulously planned the escape by renting an NFL football stadium, an island, a maze, and other locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The FBI agent and his team track Jimmy using a GPS device hidden in his underwear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

Key initial obstacles included:
*   **Telephone Pole** A giant telephone pole is used to block the path of the pursuers, requiring them to push it over to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Hedge Maze** Jimmy leads the team into a massive hedge maze, leveraging his prior knowledge of its layout from having navigated it "10 times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. He leaves money along the correct path to mislead or confirm their route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Jimmy and Tareq utilize a watch tower within the maze to monitor their pursuers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Their escape from the maze is via a pre-arranged "secret door" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Disguises and Diversions
After escaping the maze, Jimmy changes into a [[strategic_disguises_and_getaways | strategic disguise]] at Walmart, transforming into "Boomer Jim" with an old man suit, hat, and glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. He also places his money-filled backpack into a generic bag to further conceal it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

While Jimmy is inside Walmart, Tareq is tasked with popping the tires of the FBI's vehicle using a pickax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Tareq manages to puncture one tire, significantly delaying the pursuers as they attempt to change it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Jimmy successfully evades capture, narrowly missing the team inside the store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Cross-Country Travel
With the pursuers delayed, Jimmy and Tareq head to an airport to board a private jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Jimmy strategically times the jet's takeoff as the FBI team arrives at the airport, allowing them to witness his departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. The FBI agent uses his credentials to discover the jet's destination: Washington, D.C. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, forcing the team to drive for hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

Upon arrival in Washington, D.C., Jimmy utilizes a U-Store facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. He hides inside a shipping box with Tareq, arranging to be transported by a box truck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. He leaves a cryptic message: "Time is running out. I was in the box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. The FBI team is misled by a staff member and briefly searches a basement before realizing Jimmy has escaped in the truck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. This method of [[escape_tactics_and_evasion_techniques | escape tactics and evasion techniques]] allows Jimmy to maintain his lead.

## Island Pursuit
The pursuit then moves to a private island, which Jimmy and Tareq reach by boat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. The FBI team, tracking Jimmy, follows by boat and is then forced to use slow swan pedal boats to pursue him on the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Jimmy feigns a broken boat to further delay them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. On the island, Jimmy and Tareq rely on help from locals after getting lost themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## NFL Stadium Finale
The final stage of the escape takes place in a rented NFL stadium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. Jimmy has a pre-recorded video of himself playing on loop on the stadium screens, taunting the pursuers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. He also fills the stadium with mannequins to confuse the FBI team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

Inside the stadium, Jimmy announces that there are "over 70,000 seats and unlimited rooms" for him to hide in, emphasizing the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. The FBI team is distracted by the mannequins. Jimmy uses another disguise, stealing clothes from a mannequin to blend in as a fake one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. Despite the FBI team being "literally one aisle beside" him earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, Jimmy successfully evades capture, ultimately winning the challenge and keeping the $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

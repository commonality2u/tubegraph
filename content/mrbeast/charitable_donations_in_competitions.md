Challenges and competitions featured in social media content often include [[large_cash_prizes_in_competitive_events | large cash prizes]] for participants or winners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. In some instances, the winners opt to use their prize money for [[charity_and_donations_from_challenge_proceeds | charitable donations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## Example of Charitable Donation

In one competition, a military squad was tasked with hunting down an individual. If successful, they would win a prize of $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This prize was later negotiated and increased to $150,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

Upon winning the $150,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, the military squad decided to [[charitable_donations_linked_to_extravagant_spending | donate the money]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Their intention was to "help out a lot of people with it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

Specifically, the squad committed to donating the entire $150,000 prize to the HunterSeven Foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This foundation conducts research on toxic exposures affecting veterans from recent wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. This demonstrates how [[philanthropy_and_charity_prizes_in_social_media_content | social media challenges]] can serve as a platform for significant [[charitable_donations_to_people_in_need | philanthropic contributions]].

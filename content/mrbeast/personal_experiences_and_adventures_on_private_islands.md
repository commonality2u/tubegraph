This article details personal experiences and observations while visiting various private islands, ranging from the cheapest in the world to ultra-luxury destinations. The journey highlights the diverse features, amenities, and unique adventures available across different price points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## The Cheapest Private Island ($1)

The first island visited was purchased for a single dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Initial impressions revealed it to be much smaller than anticipated, consisting mainly of a random pile of bricks, an old toilet, and numerous wooden poles (pylons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Due to its limited features and small size, the island was deemed suitable only for demolition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Monkey Island ($1 Million)

Named "Monkey Island" due to being swarmed by hundreds of monkeys, this $1 million island presented unique interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The monkeys employ a strategy of gaslighting people into thinking they are friends before stealing food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. During the visit, monkeys stole an orange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, a GoPro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, and a hat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

Accommodation consists of six luxury cabanas suspended above the water, shared by both humans and monkeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The island also features a private relaxation area and a beachfront massage parlor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. A notable aspect is that the island is not a traditional landmass but the top of a massive underwater plant network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## The Frozen Island ($5 Million)

This $5 million island is characterized by its extreme cold, with the surrounding lake often frozen solid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Access is gained via hovercrafts, which were considered more fitting than snowmobiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

[[luxury_amenities_on_expensive_islands | Luxury amenities]] include futuristic self-heating huts that can withstand both warm and freezing conditions year-round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Visitors can enjoy views of the northern lights in winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a> and receive unlimited five-star food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. [[unique_activities_on_luxury_islands | Unique activities on luxury islands]] include dog sledding on the frozen lake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## The Luxury Island ($16 Million)

Despite its tiny size, this $16 million island is considered one of the most luxurious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. [[luxury_amenities_on_expensive_islands | Luxury amenities on expensive islands]] include a spacious shower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, a private helicopter (too large for the island's helipad) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, jet skis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, and multiple submarines, including a shark-themed one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

[[unique_activities_on_luxury_islands | Unique activities on luxury islands]] experienced included riding personal submarines underwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a> and jumping out of a helicopter into the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. The experience led to the sentiment that money can indeed buy happiness when it comes to such private islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

## Royal Island ($45 Million)

The $45 million "Royal Island" is so vast it cannot be captured entirely in a single camera frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. The path to the mansion is longer than the entire previous island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

[[luxury_amenities_on_expensive_islands | Luxury amenities on expensive islands]] include a mansion, a beachside bar, a private chef <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, a hot tub overlooking a cove, a pool with a scenic view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, and five luxury beachside cabanas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

[[unique_activities_on_luxury_islands | Unique activities on luxury islands]] include off-roading to explore century-old ruins at the island's far end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. The ruins were once a village over a hundred years ago, including an old bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. While the natural beauty and history were appreciated, it was questioned if the large jungle with ancient ruins justified the $45 million price tag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## The Most Luxurious Private Island ($150 Million)

This $150 million island is described as the most luxurious private island in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. It features eight mega-mansions and is completely powered by solar panels and wind turbines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. The island took over four decades to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a> and can be rented for $140,000 per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Each guest is provided with ten staff members to cater to their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

[[exotic_animals_on_private_islands | Exotic animals on private islands]] are a significant feature. The island is home to various endangered species, including giant tortoises (which can live over 200 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, flamingos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, and lemurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. The owner, Richard Branson, brought these animals to the island to help prevent their extinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

[[unique_activities_on_luxury_islands | Unique activities on luxury islands]] include a house with a roof-top driving range where guests can hit fish food golf balls into the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Other activities include playing tennis and basketball, exploring multiple mansions, and taking a cold plunge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. A particularly unique experience was being served sushi by mermaids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. The sheer number of available activities was overwhelming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

## The Super Island ($250 Million)

The most expensive island visited, valued at $250 million, features an entire amusement park with over a dozen waterslides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. It also boasts its own hot air balloon, zip lines across man-made beaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>, and five gargantuan pools capable of hosting over 13,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. [[exotic_animals_on_private_islands | Exotic animals on private islands]] like peacocks are present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>, along with various games like soccer pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

A striking feature is the presence of over 100 lifeguards, an excessive number for a private group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. The group opted to give the lifeguards the day off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. The main adventure on this island was riding "Daredevil's Peak," the tallest waterslide in North America, towering over 135 feet tall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. The experience of riding the extremely fast and scary waterslide was described as intense and akin to being hit by a truck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. Despite the fear, the overall experience on the island was considered awesome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

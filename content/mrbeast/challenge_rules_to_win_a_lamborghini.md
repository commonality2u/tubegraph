The **[[lamborghini_protection_challenge | Lamborghini Protection Challenge]]** involved 50 randomly selected people competing to win a brand new $300,000 Lamborghini by being the last person to keep their right hand on the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The challenge was continuously monitored by over 50 cameras to detect any hand removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Initial Rules

*   **Hand Placement**: Participants were required to keep their right hand on the Lamborghini at all times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.
*   **Duration**: The challenge would last "as long as it takes" until only one person remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Prizes**:
    *   The last person to keep their hand on the car wins the $300,000 Lamborghini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.
    *   Every person participating was guaranteed to walk away with a prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Challenge Modifications and Elimination Methods

Throughout the challenge, various scenarios and additional rules or incentives were introduced to test the participants' endurance and determination:

### Practical Needs
*   **Bathroom Breaks**: A detached windshield wiper from the Lamborghini was provided. By touching the wiper with their right hand, participants could temporarily leave the car while still being "technically touching the car" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### Strategic Eliminations and Incentives
*   **Startling Participants**:
    *   Water was sprayed, causing one participant to react and remove their hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
    *   Loud car revs were used to startle contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>, leading to further eliminations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **Distractions and Accidental Slips**:
    *   Pizza was brought out, hoping people would slip up while eating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This led to an elimination when someone's foot was stepped on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
    *   Dropping items like water bottles and attempting to pick them up led to elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Sleeping Opportunities**: Sleeping bags were provided to encourage participants to fall asleep and accidentally remove their hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Some participants tried to avoid sleeping to prevent accidental removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
    *   Duct-taping hands to the car was allowed for the night, but even this didn't prevent some eliminations due to subconscious movements during sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Footage was shown to prove eliminations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Prize Offers for Quitting**:
    *   A brand new Nissan was offered to the next person to get out within 10 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
    *   A Chevrolet Camaro was used as a decoy to lure contestants away from the Lamborghini. Whoever touched the Camaro first could keep it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
    *   Participants were offered specific cash amounts and items (e.g., $20,000 and a MacBook; $25,000 and phone replacements) to voluntarily leave the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
    *   A participant was guaranteed a spot in the next challenge and $10,000 for voluntarily leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **Money Cannon**: A cannon was used to fire cash, hoping participants would try to grab it and remove their hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This strategy did not result in an elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Raising the Lamborghini**: After the number of contestants dwindled, the Lamborghini was progressively raised higher off the ground, forcing participants to reach up and strain their hands and arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
    *   The car was first raised 2 feet off the ground for the final six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
    *   For the final five, it was raised even higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
    *   For the final four, it was raised again, becoming so high that one participant was effectively trapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
    *   For the final two, the Lamborghini was raised to its maximum height, requiring participants to stand on their tippy-toes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.
*   **Single Finger Rule**: With only four contestants left, the rule changed from keeping a whole hand on the car to only a single finger. Participants chose which finger to use, with most choosing their pointer finger, and one choosing their pinky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

## Prizes for Eliminated Contestants

*   **First Out**: $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Early Eliminations**: Often received $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Specific Challenges**: Participants who voluntarily left during specific prize offers received what was offered (e.g., a new Nissan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, a Camaro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, cash amounts up to $25,000 and other items like MacBooks or phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>).
*   **Top 10**: Reward for making it to the top 10 included picking various prizes like iPhones, iPads, and cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **Second Place**: The runner-up received $40,000 in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

## Outcome

The challenge culminated with one participant winning the brand new Lamborghini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. The Lamborghini's condition changed significantly from the beginning of the challenge due to the duration and events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

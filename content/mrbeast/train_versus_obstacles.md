A series of experiments were conducted to test the destructive power of a train against various man-made [[obstacle_creation_and_evasion | obstacles]]. These tests were part of a larger set of experiments that included flattening a Lamborghini, climbing a building with a Spider-Man suit, and the world's largest elephant toothpaste experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Brick Wall Challenge

The initial experiment involved a train attempting to break through a formidable brick wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

*   **Obstacle Details**: The brick wall was constructed to be 20 feet tall and three feet thick, designed not to go down easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: Despite its robust construction, the brick wall was unable to stop the train <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

> "Will the brick wall stop the train? Oh my God! My gosh!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>

## Semi-Trucks Challenge

Following the brick wall's failure, a more significant [[obstacle_creation_and_evasion | obstacle]] was set up: five massive semi-trucks positioned to halt the train <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

*   **Obstacle Details**: Five large semi-trucks were used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Crash test dummies, resembling the participants, were placed inside the trucks to observe the impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Most of the crew predicted the train would prevail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: The train tore through the semi-trucks, snapping them in half and dragging their remnants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. The crash test dummies were largely destroyed, with limbs detached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Conclusion

In both experiments, the train proved superior, overcoming the brick wall and the five semi-trucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

The challenge set by MrBeast involved 100 boys and 100 girls competing in separate circles for 100 hours, with the team that had more people remaining at the end winning $500,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The primary rule for [[contestant_experiences_and_eliminations | elimination]] was simple: touching the red line surrounding the circle resulted in immediate removal from the competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Initial Departures

Within the first 20 minutes, five boys had left the challenge, while no girls had been eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Reasons for these early departures varied:
*   One boy left to go on a date with his girlfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   Another boy stated he couldn't risk losing his recently acquired job over $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   MrBeast intentionally kept the duration of the challenge a secret to encourage early [[contestants_motivations_for_winning | exits]] due to contestants having existing job or family commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Some contestants left due to prior work obligations or family responsibilities, such as a girl who had to leave because she had a baby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, and others who needed to preserve their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   An early [[voting_and_elimination_process | elimination]] occurred when a boy was deemed out after video review showed his foot clearly stepping on the red line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   Many girls left by "gambling on their team winning without their help" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, indicating a strategic but risky decision.

## Mid-ChallengeAttrition

### The Oatmeal Test
As the challenge progressed, food became a factor. Oatmeal was provided for dinner to test [[contestant_strategies_and_dynamics | contestants']] resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   The boys lost 16 people due to the oatmeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   The girls, who also disliked the oatmeal, only lost four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This suggested the oatmeal was a "psychological torture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a> that led to [[contestant_experiences_and_eliminations | contestants]] giving up.

### Mental and Physical Strain
Beyond the oatmeal, the prolonged nature of the [[challenges_and_eliminations_in_a_largescale_competition | competition]] took its toll:
*   Some people "couldn't handle the pressure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   One girl left to save another contestant's cat, which was alone at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   By day three, [[contestant_macks_journey_and_redemption | contestants]] were "losing their minds" due to lack of showers and boredom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

### Temptation-Based Eliminations
MrBeast introduced temptations to encourage [[contestants_decision_making | eliminations]]:
*   **Empty Briefcases**: MrBeast's team placed empty briefcases near the red line. Several boys exited the circle to retrieve them, only to find them empty or containing trivial items like cereal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. The girls, however, proved "smarter than the guys" and didn't fall for this trick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
*   **The Red Button**: A red button was placed in each circle. Pressing it would halve their own circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. A boy instantly pressed the button in the boys' circle without knowing its effect, causing their space to shrink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. The girls did not press theirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

### Strategic Elimination
During the Rubik's Cube challenge, where losing would halve the circle, only one boy knew how to solve the cubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. MrBeast offered this boy $10,000 to leave, which he accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. This dramatically affected the boys' ability to win the challenge, which they eventually did anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

## Final Hours of the Challenge

For the final 10 hours, each circle was divided into 10 sections, and every hour, one section had to be blocked off, effectively shrinking the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.
*   Three boys were eliminated in the final hours due to "sloppy" movements, touching the red line with a finger, or stepping out of the porta potty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

After 100 hours, 33 boys remained from the initial 100, while 35 girls remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. This meant the girls' team won the half a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

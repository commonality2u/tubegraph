A [[challenge_to_win_money | contest]] was held where 10 individuals, who found golden tickets in Feastable Bars, competed for the grand prize: ownership of a real-life recreated Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The factory featured numerous fantastical elements, including a chocolate river with a waterfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, a marshmallow area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, and a chocolate door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Challenges

Throughout the [[challenges_for_subscribers_to_win_money | contest]], participants faced a series of [[unique_contests_and_games | unique challenges]] to avoid elimination and progress towards [[winning_and_allocation_of_prize_money_in_challenges | winning the chocolate factory]].

### Hide and Seek
For the first [[challenge_to_win_money | challenge]], contestants had 1,000 seconds to hide within the chocolate factory, with the last person found being eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Candy Wall of Death
This [[games_and_contests_with_highvalue_prizes | challenge]] involved climbing a "Candy Wall of Death," which was a rock-climbing wall covered in various candies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The last person to reach the top was eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. When two contestants were unable to reach the top, their fate was decided by a game of rock, paper, scissors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Chocolate Bar Eating Contest
Contestants were paired into teams for a speed-eating [[challenge_to_win_money | challenge]] featuring Feastables chocolate bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Professional competitive eaters Matt Stonie and Joey Chestnut demonstrated the technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. The last team to finish eating their chocolate bars was eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### World's Largest Mentos Drop
The remaining six contestants were tasked with dropping the world's largest Mentos into the world's largest bottle of Coke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The contestant who successfully landed the Mentos into the bottle earned the right to choose who would be eliminated from the other five participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. The eliminated contestant received a solid gold Mentos as a parting gift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

### Peppermint Carousel
In a room filled with marshmallows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, contestants stood on peppermint carousels that spun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. The [[challenge_to_win_100000 | challenge]] was to remain on the spinning carousel; the first person to fall off was eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### Cake or Real Toilet
The final four contestants faced four toilets, three of which were real and one made entirely of cake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Blindfolded, each contestant chose a toilet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. The person who chose the cake toilet was eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. Creating the cake toilet reportedly took a very long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

### Final Cooking Challenge
The final three contestants participated in a cooking [[unique giveaways and competitions | challenge]] judged by Gordon Ramsay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. They had 45 minutes to create a dessert, which Ramsay judged on appearance and taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. The contestant with the highest combined score (out of 20) won the chocolate factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. One of the losing finalists received $10,000 for their participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.

## Outcome
The winner of the final [[challenge to win 100000 | challenge]] was awarded the deed to the chocolate factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. However, the factory's upkeep was costly, estimated at over a hundred thousand dollars per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. The original host then offered the winner $500,000 in cash to buy the factory back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. The winner accepted the offer, exchanging the deed for the cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

## Feastables Promotion
The contest also served to promote new Feastables chocolate bars, including milk chocolate and sea salt flavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. The bars are highlighted for having only four to five ingredients and tasting good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. Other prizes, such as 10 Teslas and large sums of cash, were also part of the Feastables launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

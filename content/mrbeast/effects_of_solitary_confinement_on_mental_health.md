From: [[mrbeast]] <br/> 

The effects of [[solitary_confinement_challenges | solitary confinement]] on [[the_impact_of_isolation_on_mental_health | mental health]] were extensively documented during a seven-day challenge undertaken in a soundproof, white room with zero human contact and zero stimulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This environment was noted as "psychologically dangerous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Expert Warnings

A doctor with 23 years of experience in psychiatric hospitals stated that the challenge was "much worse than anything I've ever seen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. According to the doctor, anything beyond 50 hours in such a room can lead to permanent [[psychological_effects_of_longterm_confinement | psychological damage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The participant aimed to complete 168 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. There was a stated risk of the participant losing their mind and entering psychosis, which could cause permanent damage, necessitating their removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The doctor emphasized that without social contact and incoming information, the brain generates "craziness," including hallucinations and paranoia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## [[psychological_impact_of_isolation | Psychological Impact of Isolation]]

The [[psychological effects of isolation | psychological effects of isolation]] and sensory deprivation became evident early in the challenge:

*   **Loss of Time Perception**
    The participant began misjudging time significantly, being off by two hours around the 14-hour mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. By approximately 40 hours into the challenge, he was six hours off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This [[impact_of_solitary_confinement_on_perception_of_time | loss of time perception]] led to other problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Even halfway through the 168-hour challenge (84 hours), he was off by a full day in his estimation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Nearing the end, he was desperate to know the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>, and was convinced he had only hours left when in reality, 24 hours remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

*   **Sensory Deprivation and Psychological Distress**
    The lack of stimulation led to immediate challenges. The participant found it difficult to entertain himself, even resorting to counting tiles on the walls (1900 on walls, 2860 including roof and floor) just nine hours in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The constant bright lights severely affected his brain, causing insomnia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a> and ginormous headaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. The doctor noted the participant's agitation by way of boredom and described the experience as "very dehumanizing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

*   **Emotional and Behavioral Changes**
    As the challenge progressed, several [[psychological_effects_of_isolation | psychological effects of isolation]] manifested:
    *   **Boredom and Agitation:** Extreme boredom set in, becoming mentally very hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
    *   **Paranoia:** The participant began to exhibit signs of paranoia, questioning the intentions of those outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a> and feeling watched by numerous cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
    *   **Regression:** The participant's behavior regressed, described as "climbing the wall" due to a natural human urge for freedom, akin to regressing to primal instinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Later, he was observed "napping on the floor, throwing things, having tantrums, getting happy when he gets snacks," like a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.
    *   **[[the_impact_of_isolation_on_mental_health | Mental Deterioration]]:** He expressed that his mind was "slowly deforming into stupidity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a> and later forgot the names of common objects like a "roll" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. The participant himself stated he would "borderline go insane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, confirming the doctor's prediction that he would run out of things to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
    *   **Depression, Sadness, and Loneliness:** A significant wave of depression followed moments of brief happiness from meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. He reached "literal rock bottom" mentally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>, describing himself as "depressed and lonely and to be honest, miserable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. He cried, stated it was "torture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>, and repeatedly expressed an intense desire to leave the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
    *   **Perpetual Hunger:** Despite receiving enough calories, the participant felt constantly hungry due to being understimulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
    *   **Dreams:** His dreams began to reflect his confinement, with some dreams being about him being in the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. He preferred sleeping because his dreams allowed him to be in the outside world, making him happier than being awake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
    *   **Loss of Human Rights:** He expressed feeling like an animal and having lost all his rights as a human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
    *   **Fear of Missing Out (FOMO):** The participant experienced a "severe FOMO" from missing external events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## [[coping_mechanisms_in_solitary_confinement | Coping Mechanisms in Solitary Confinement]]

Faced with extreme boredom and a lack of stimulation, the participant attempted various [[coping_mechanisms_in_solitary_confinement | coping mechanisms]]:
*   **Counting:** He counted tiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, counted as high as he could <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, and later counted individual grains of rice (447 grains on one tray) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   **Mental Diversions:** He tried to envision being in a park, with green grass and people fishing, to distract himself from the reality of the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. The doctor noted he had to "invent concepts that only exist in his mind" to avoid intense depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Physical Activity:** He tried to perform handstands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a> and decided to do a thousand laps around the room, which quickly made him dizzy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. He also resorted to bouncing objects like a metal plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, a burger wrapper, and a cup, playing self-invented games of basketball and baseball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
*   **Sleep:** His primary strategy was to sleep through most of the challenge to pass the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, even sleeping for 12 hours in the bathroom where it was darker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Cleaning:** Towards the very end, he cleaned the room as an excuse to alleviate boredom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

He found simple things like the ceiling outside "awesome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a> and was overjoyed to see the night sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>.

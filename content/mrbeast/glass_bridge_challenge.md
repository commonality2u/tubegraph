The Glass Bridge is a returning challenge where participants must cross a bridge made of platforms, guessing which ones are safe to step on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The objective is to make it to the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Rules and Objective
The challenge involves guessing a platform, either left or right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. If a participant picks the wrong platform, they fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. There are 15 platforms in total to cross <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The prize for successfully reaching the other side is 456 grand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Participants and Attempts

### First Attempt (456)
A participant identified as "456" (also referred to as John) from a previous "Squid Game" challenge was brought back for the Glass Bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The host initially gave a hint for the first step, advising to pick "right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Recognizing the extremely low probability of success, the host then provided the entire sequence of correct platforms: "right, then it's left, left, left, right, right, left, left, left, right, left, right, right, right left" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

Despite receiving the answers, John failed to remember the sequence and chose "left" on the second platform, which was incorrect as it should have been "three lefts in a row" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Second Attempt (067)
Another participant, identified as "067," also from the "Squid Game" challenge, was brought in for a second attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The correct first answer was "right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. The host again recited the full sequence of correct platforms: "Right, left, left, left, right, right, left, left, left, right, left, right, right, right left" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. When asked if the sequence could be repeated, the host declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The participant made a mistake and fell early in the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Third Attempt (Chris)
Chris, who had heard the correct sequences given to the previous two participants, was then asked to attempt the bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Despite hearing the answers twice, Chris struggled with memory and eventually fell after making a wrong choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

Competitive events, such as Mr. Beast's "Last to Leave the Circle Wins $500,000" challenge, often highlight how [[team_dynamics_and_alliances_in_competitions | teamwork and alliances]] can emerge even in individual competitions. While the ultimate prize goes to a single victor, contestants may form temporary [[group_dynamics_and_alliances_in_a_competitive_setting | alliances]] or engage in [[competitive_teamwork | collaborative efforts]] to gain advantages, overcome obstacles, or simply survive longer.

## Emergence of [[competitive_strategy and teamwork | Collaborative Strategies]]

Initially, the challenge appears to be purely individual, with 100 people competing to be the last one remaining in a giant circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, as the competition progresses and new challenges are introduced, instances of [[team_collaboration_and_competition_in_building | collaboration]] begin to appear.

### The Tesla Challenge

A significant example of [[competitive_teamwork | teamwork]] occurred during the "Tesla Challenge." Contestants were offered a Tesla if they could ride a special tarp and touch the car without touching the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Rather than each person attempting the feat individually, contestants began to "engineer a team" to help one person win the Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. This involved using a tarp and an inner tube, with multiple people working together to provide momentum for the chosen participant, Jack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Airrack also contributed to providing momentum for Jack's successful attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This demonstrates how a shared, immediate goal (winning the Tesla) can temporarily supersede individual competition for the main prize, fostering [[team_dynamics_and_strategies | strategic teamwork]].

### Duct-Taping Pairs

On Day 9, a twist was introduced requiring contestants to pair up and be duct-taped together for the rest of the day, additionally prohibiting them from sitting down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. This forced [[teamwork_and_alliances_in_competitions | collaboration]] and coordination, regardless of prior [[friendship_and_competition_dynamics | relationships]] or personal preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. One contestant expressed dislike for their partner, highlighting the challenge of forced [[team_dynamics_and_strategies | team dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

## Impact of [[competition_dynamics_and_teamwork | Alliances]]

While direct alliances to eliminate competitors weren't explicitly shown, the shift in how challenges were approached demonstrates a flexible [[team_dynamics_and_strategies | strategy]] where [[teamwork_and_alliances_in_competitions | alliances]] could form based on shared immediate objectives. The initial 100 contestants were even split into "quadrants" by shirt color on Day 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, potentially fostering smaller internal [[group_dynamics_and_alliances_in_a_competitive_setting | group dynamics]], though the transcript doesn't detail direct competitive actions stemming from this division.

Even when [[teamwork_and_alliances_in_competitions | alliances]] fail, such as Corey stepping on the line during the Tesla challenge, the response of rewarding him for "putting others above yourself" indicates an acknowledgment of the value of [[competitive_teamwork | collaborative spirit]] within the competitive setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

The game of tag, as played in this context, is a large-scale, high-stakes elimination challenge set in an expansive, abandoned location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The objective is to be the last person remaining untagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Location
The game takes place at an abandoned hospital featuring over 100 different rooms and six surrounding buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This provides a vast and complex environment for players to hide and for the "it" person to search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, influencing [[hide_and_seek_game_setup_and_strategy | hide and seek game setup and strategy]].

## Objective
The primary objective for the players is to evade being tagged by the "it" person. The last person successfully evading a tag wins a grand prize of $100,000 in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This overall structure falls under [[challenge_format_and_rules | challenge format and rules]] and [[mr_beast_challenge_setup_and_rules | Mr Beast challenge setup and rules]].

## Game Start
The game begins with a 10-second countdown, after which the "it" person starts actively seeking players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Gameplay Mechanics
The game incorporates several [[challenge_mechanics_and_rules | challenge mechanics and rules]]:

### Getting Tagged
*   **Elimination**: When a player is "touched" or "tagged" by the "it" person, they are eliminated from the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.
*   **"Jail"**: Eliminated players are escorted to a designated "jail" area, effectively removing them from further play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Chaser Dynamics
*   **Assistance**: The "it" person (Jimmy) can enlist help from other individuals to hunt down players. For example, Chris joins Jimmy as a secondary chaser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Later, Karl also assists in searching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   **Coordination**: Chasers communicate and coordinate their movements to trap players, utilizing walkie-talkies and spatial awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Zone Constriction
*   **Confining Play Area**: As the number of remaining players decreases, the game area is constricted. Initially spanning the entire hospital and its six buildings, the zone is later limited to just the hospital interior to intensify the search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

### Incentives and Traps
*   **Mid-Game Prize**: A briefcase containing $10,000 is placed in the middle of the hospital as an optional prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. However, grabbing this prize requires the player to carry it around, potentially making them more vulnerable and serving as a strategic trap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This illustrates [[creative_rules_for_winning_prizes | creative rules for winning prizes]].
*   **Bribes**: The "it" person can offer incentives (like promoting a channel) for information leading to a player's location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Players can also attempt to negotiate with the "it" person to avoid being tagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This is part of the [[game_show_agreements_and_rules | game show agreements and rules]].

### Player Strategies and Tactics
Participants employ various [[hide_and_seek_strategies | hide and seek strategies]] and [[tactics_and_decisions_by_participants | tactics and decisions by participants]] to evade capture:
*   **Hiding Spots**: Players utilize diverse hiding spots, including under trailers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, on rooftops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, under money piles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, inside cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>, and even in bathrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.
*   **Evasion**: Players attempt to outrun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a> and outmaneuver the chasers, using jukes and rapid movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **Deception**: Players may use false leads or feign hiding in certain areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

## Winning and Prizes
*   **Winner**: The last participant who remains untagged by the end of the game wins the grand prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
*   **Consolation Prizes**: Even if a player does not win the main prize, they may receive consolation money. For instance, Jordan received $10,000 despite being caught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>, and all other competitors received $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

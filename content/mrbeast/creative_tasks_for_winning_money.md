A series of unique and engaging challenges offer participants the chance to win significant cash prizes or valuable items. These [[creative_challenges_for_entertainment | creative challenges for entertainment]] often involve a mix of skill, luck, prediction, and sometimes even relationship knowledge.

## Diamond or Mystery Cheque?
One early challenge presents a participant with a choice: a guaranteed $38,000 diamond ring or a mystery cheque with an unknown value hidden by tape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16"></a>. The participant chose the ring for its guaranteed value, missing out on a $100,000 cheque <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44"></a>. This highlights the risk-reward aspect of these [[creative_ways_to_win_money_or_prizes | creative ways to win money or prizes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26"></a>.

## Jelly Bean Guess
Contestants are challenged to accurately guess the number of jelly beans in a large jar for a chance to win $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52"></a>. This [[challenge_to_win_money | challenge to win money]] requires estimation skills, with one participant guessing 72,368, significantly off the actual count of 8,171 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14"></a>.

## Solo Cup Laying Challenge
A participant is tasked with laying out red solo cups on the floor, earning $1 for every cup placed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52"></a>. The challenge offers unlimited cups and an entire day to cover a whole room, with the option to stack them once the floor is covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57"></a>. One participant, Andre, laid an estimated 4,700 cups, rounded up to 5,000, earning $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53"></a>.

## Breaking the Ice Briefcase
In this [[creative_approaches_in_winning_prizes | creative approach to winning prizes]], a briefcase containing $10,000 is frozen inside a large block of ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28"></a>. Contestants pick a number between one and 20, which determines the number of swings they get with a pickaxe to retrieve the briefcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13"></a>. One contestant, Grant, received 15 swings but failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17"></a>, while another, Felix, with 10 swings, managed to free the briefcase enough to carry it out, winning the $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11"></a>.

## Basketball Shot Challenge
A wall of basketball goals is set up, and contestants take shots to earn items from a shelf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51"></a>. The [[creative_rules_for_winning_prizes | creative rules for winning prizes]] dictate that they can shoot as many times as desired, but a single miss results in losing all accumulated items and ending the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00"></a>. In one instance, brothers competed together, risking a MacBook Pro and Oculus Rift before missing a shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26"></a>. Another participant, Chandler, amassed numerous prizes like AirPods, Beats, an iPad, and a Theragun before finally missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02"></a>. This challenge combines skill with high stakes, fitting for [[trick_shots_and_challenges_for_cash_prizes | trick shots and challenges for cash prizes]].

## Race Prediction
A participant is offered $10,000 if they correctly predict the winner of a race between two individuals, Carl and Chris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47"></a>. If they pick the loser, they receive nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50"></a>. To add a twist, Carl is offered $5,000 if he wins, regardless of the prediction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06"></a>.

## Mystery Bucket Challenge
Three buckets (blue, red, yellow) are presented, one filled with money, one with mustard, and one with slime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03"></a>. A participant, Isaiah, must decide who stands under each bucket. If the person Isaiah chooses for the money bucket ends up getting the money, Isaiah wins $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16"></a>. Isaiah correctly chose the yellow bucket for Chris, which turned out to be mustard, and the red bucket for Carl, which was slime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20"></a>. This meant the blue bucket, which Isaiah had reserved for himself, was the money bucket, winning him $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12"></a>.

## Relationship Compatibility Challenge
In a "relationship challenge," a couple, Matt and Elizabeth, are separated and asked questions about their relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24"></a>. If they provide the same answer to all questions, they win a mystery prize, revealed to be $15,000 towards their wedding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01"></a>. The final question involves Matt proposing to Elizabeth on camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55"></a>. They successfully answered the questions and Elizabeth accepted the proposal, earning them the $15,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21"></a>.

## Ramen Car vs. Real Car
Participants are given a choice between two cars, one of which is a real Mini Cooper and the other is a car made entirely out of ramen noodles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58"></a>.

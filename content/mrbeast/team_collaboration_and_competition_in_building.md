This article details a challenge where two teams competed to build the world's largest Lego tower within 12 hours for a $50,000 prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The competition highlighted various aspects of [[competitive_teamwork | competitive teamwork]], including strategic planning, adaptation to challenges, and inter-team dynamics.

## Challenge Setup and Teams

The competition began with two teams, each starting with two members. Chris's team included Carl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, and Chandler's team included Tyler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The prize of $50,000 had to be split between the partners if they won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Both teams were later expanded to four people each, significantly increasing their potential for tower construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Heavy-duty machinery, specifically cranes, were provided to assist in building the towers to extreme heights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. An extensive supply of Lego bricks was available, with more stored in trucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Competitive Dynamics and Strategies

The competition fostered intense [[competition_dynamics_and_teamwork | competition dynamics and teamwork]]. Early in the challenge, Chandler's team established an early lead, with their tower reaching five and a half feet while Chris's tower was around four feet and three inches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Defensive and Offensive Tactics

Teams employed various [[competitive_strategy_and_teamwork | competitive strategy and teamwork]]:
*   **Defensive Walls:** Chandler's team built a protective wall around their tower to defend against attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This strategy proved effective, as the wall successfully blocked a bowling ball thrown by the opposing team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Bowling Ball Attacks:** Periodically, bowling balls were thrown at the towers to test their stability and inflict damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Despite multiple attempts, Chandler's wall held up, even causing the bowling ball itself to break on one occasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Mini-Challenges and Penalties

A mini-challenge was introduced, giving teams 20 minutes to build the tallest tower. The losing team had to remove one member for 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Chandler's team won this mini-challenge with a tower measuring 20 feet and two inches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, while Chris's tower was eight and a half feet tall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. As a result, Chris's team had to boot Zach for 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### Structural Reinforcement

As the towers grew taller, [[teamwork_and_problem_solving | teamwork and problem solving]] became crucial for stability.
*   Chandler's team planned to build two towers and connect them for more structural support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   They also controversially added concrete to their Lego bricks by pouring it down the middle of the structure to harden the inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

## Setbacks and Resilience

The challenge tested the teams' resilience.
*   **Tower Collapse:** Chandler's (later Timmy's) tower dramatically fell from 35-40 feet to about 15 feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Despite the setback, the team maintained a positive outlook, stating they could "come back from it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **Fatigue and Departure:** Chandler, the captain of one team, left the competition early due to exhaustion, stating he had "completely exerted all of [his] energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. He pledged all his potential winnings to his team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This departure significantly impacted his team's morale and capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## Conclusion and Prize Distribution

At the end of the 12 hours, a final bowling ball throw was allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Chandler's (now Timmy's) tower, despite its earlier collapse, remained standing after the final throw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, protected by its initial wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

The final measurements were:
*   **Chris's Team Tower:** 29 feet and four and a half inches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Timmy's Team Tower:** 29 feet and five and a half inches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

Timmy's team won by exactly one Lego block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. The $50,000 prize was distributed among the winning team members. Since Chandler left early, it was up to the remaining team members whether to give him a portion of the winnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

The winners were then challenged to spend their money within one hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, leading to personal acts of generosity:
*   **Weddle:** Gave his winnings to his brother, Zach, to pay off student loan debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Timmy:** Gave $4,000 to his brother for a car and $10,000 to his mom whose work hours were cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
*   **Tyler:** Secured a year of free rent for his mom, surprising her with the news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

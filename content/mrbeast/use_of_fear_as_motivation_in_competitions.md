In various challenges, fear is frequently employed as a potent motivator to encourage contestants to perform tasks they might otherwise avoid, often with significant financial incentives on the line. This approach leverages the contestants' willingness to confront their phobias or anxieties for a desired reward, highlighting aspects of [[incentives_and_motivations_in_challenges | incentives and motivations in challenges]].

## Direct Confrontation with Phobias

Several competitions involve contestants directly facing their fears:

### Snakes in a Bathtub
One challenge presented a bathtub filled with snakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Contestants were offered $10,000 for their mother if they sat in the tub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. One contestant, Chandler, immediately declined and left without hearing the full offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, showcasing an immediate avoidance response to fear. Another contestant, Chris, ultimately sat in the tub, enduring the experience to secure the prize money for his mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Cockroach Cash Grab
A box containing $15,000 was filled with giant cockroaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Contestant Jeff was tasked with grabbing as much money as possible within 60 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The host intentionally used the presence of cockroaches to create suspense, even encouraging Jeff to pet one for an extra second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Despite the fear-inducing environment, Jeff managed to win $9,340 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Tarantula Test
Tareq was offered $10,000 for his mother if he allowed a tarantula to crawl on him for 30 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. To heighten the stakes and add to the [[emotional_struggle_and_fear_of_failure | emotional struggle and fear of failure]], the host facetiously offered to double the money if the tarantula bit him, knowing it wouldn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Tareq successfully completed the challenge, securing the prize for his mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Rat-Infested Safe Challenge
Karl was challenged to open a safe in a room that progressively filled with rats, with a new rat introduced every 10 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The presence of the rats created an intense, fear-driven environment as Karl frantically worked to deduce the code. His reaction of screaming "Holy shi-" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a> and noting rats "All around me!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a> highlights the effectiveness of this fear tactic. He successfully opened the safe, winning $20,000 for another contestant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### The Pickle Phobia
Chandler, who is "terrified of pickles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, was challenged to sit in a tub full of them. Initially, $10,000 was offered to his sister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, but this was raised to $20,000 to increase his motivation, as the host knew he wouldn't do it for less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Despite his intense aversion and screaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, his sister ultimately pushed him in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, securing the $20,000 for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This highlights how external motivation (for a family member) can overcome personal phobias.

## Conclusion
The use of fear in these challenges serves as a powerful motivator, driving contestants to overcome significant personal discomfort for substantial financial gain. These scenarios demonstrate the dynamic interplay between fear, motivation, and the pursuit of reward, which is a common theme in [[emotional_dynamics_in_competitions | emotional dynamics in competitions]] and [[contestants_motivations_for_winning | contestants motivations for winning]].

This article details various large-scale stunt experiments and pranks designed to test boundaries and create spectacles, often involving significant destruction and surprising outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These events fall under the category of [[creative_stunts_and_highrisk_video_challenges | creative stunts and high-risk video challenges]] and [[challenges_and_social_experiments | challenges and social experiments]].

## Train vs. Obstacles

### Brick Wall Challenge
One experiment involved testing if a train could be stopped by a massive brick wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The wall was constructed to be "20 feet tall and three feet thick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, indicating it was not expected to go down easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Ultimately, the brick wall did not stop the train <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

### Semi-Truck Barrier
Following the brick wall test, a larger obstacle was introduced: five semi-trucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Crash test dummies representing the participants were placed in the trucks to observe the potential impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Despite the trucks' massive size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, the train "snapped it in half" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, tearing through them and dragging debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. The train was declared the clear victor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## Car Jumps and Crashes

### Bus Jump Challenge
A car was driven off a "giant ramp" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a> to see how many buses it could jump over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Initial predictions ranged from at least three to all twelve buses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The car ended up going "through a bus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Jet-Engine Powered Car Jump
The same challenge was then attempted using a car equipped with [[jet_engines_on_cars_and_vehicle_stunts | jet engines]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, making it go "way faster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This vehicle "literally knocked a bus over" and ended up embedded in the side of a bus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. These stunts are examples of [[unconventional_chase_scenarios_and_stunts | unconventional chase scenarios and stunts]].

## Dropping a Car into Orbeez

A pool was filled with "1 billion Orbeez" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a> to test if they could cushion the fall of a car dropped from a helicopter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The car's owner, Tareq, was unaware his vehicle was being used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

The car was dropped from a significant height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Despite the impact, the car appeared to have a "perfect landing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. After draining the Orbeez, the car was revealed to be "destroyed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. It was later revealed that the car dropped was a "perfect replica" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, not Tareq's actual vehicle, which had been moved to a random field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Tareq's reaction to this prank demonstrates [[participant_reactions_to_unusual_tasks | participant reactions to unusual tasks]].

## Meteor Strikes on a House Replica

A scaled replica of a house from the game *Hello Neighbor 2* was built to observe what would happen if it were hit by a meteor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Mannequins representing the participants were placed inside to determine the safest hiding spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This experiment tests [[psychological_experiments_and_human_limits | psychological experiments and human limits]] in a simulated disaster scenario.

### Meteor Impacts
*   **First Meteor**: After the first impact, one mannequin (Karl) surprisingly remained standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Second Meteor (on fire)**: A flaming meteor was dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. One mannequin (Chris) also survived this impact, although the scene was still smoking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Third Meteor**: The final meteor impact caused significant destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, but the participant who chose a specific hiding spot (Jimmy) claimed to have survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

## Giant Elephant Toothpaste Experiment

A reaction was demonstrated by mixing two chemicals to produce "elephant foam toothpaste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. This was followed by a much larger experiment using 100 times the previous amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. The massive foam eruption filled an entire pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, setting a new world record for elephant foam toothpaste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This stunt is a significant example of [[using_elephant_toothpaste_in_pranks | using elephant toothpaste in pranks]] and [[pranking_brothers_with_elephant_toothpaste | pranking brothers with elephant toothpaste]].

## Spider-Man Suit Building Climb

A professional Spider-Man stunt double, Dave, attempted to climb a massive skyscraper using a "working Spider-Man suit" created by J. Laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. The highest J. Laser had previously climbed with the suit was 200 feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. Dave aimed to climb 400 feet, which would involve climbing 200 feet twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Despite rain causing issues with the suit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, Dave persevered, stating that Spider-Man never gives up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. He successfully completed the 400-foot climb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, earning a $10,000 reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

## Lamborghini vs. Hydraulic Press & Explosion

The final experiment involved flattening a Lamborghini with a hydraulic press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. Mannequins were placed inside the car to see if they could survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. The press crushed the vehicle, causing windows to shatter and tires to collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. The Lamborghini was confirmed to no longer work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. As a follow-up, the flattened Lamborghini was then blown up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This dramatic conclusion is reminiscent of [[extreme_dynamite_and_explosives_experiments | extreme dynamite and explosives experiments]].

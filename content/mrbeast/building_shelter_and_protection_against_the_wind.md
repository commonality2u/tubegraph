Surviving 50 hours in Antarctica, the coldest place on Earth, presented immediate challenges, primarily the need for adequate shelter and protection from extreme wind and cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Initial Camp Setup
Upon landing, the first priority was to trek towards the mountains to gain some natural protection from the wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Despite an incoming blizzard and already bad weather conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, the team managed to set up their shelter at the base of a mountain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, declaring it "Camp Beast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. With temperatures dropping to negative 30 degrees, establishing a shelter quickly was critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, especially after one tent nearly blew away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Constructing an Ice Wall
A common challenge in Antarctica is the extreme weather threatening to blow away tents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. To counter this, the team was instructed to cut snow blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. These ice blocks were then used to [[construction_and_defense_strategies | build a wall]] around the camp, specifically to secure the tents and provide protection from the wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This construction effort was described as the hardest thing the team had ever done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Once the ice wall was complete, it was hoped it would prevent the tents from being blown away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Camp Challenges and Infrastructure
Beyond the primary shelter, other logistical elements were necessary for survival:
*   **Constant Cold**: Even with layers of clothing, the risk of frostbite remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, and cameras struggled in the freezing temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Waste Management**: Due to the pristine environment, bodily waste could not be left on the snow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Urine had to be collected in bottles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, and a dedicated "poop tent" was set up away from the main camp for defecation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, with a bucket serving as the toilet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Secret Project**: Some team members secretly dug a large hole within the camp over 20 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, reaching a depth of eight feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This was described as "the best use of our time possible" by those involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

## Departure Protocol
Maintaining the untouched beauty of Antarctica was paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Before leaving, the team had to ensure they left no trace of their camp behind, putting everything back as it was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. This included filling in the large hole that had been dug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. The task of packing up was physically demanding as the team was exhausted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

This wiki article details the setup, strategies, and challenges of a large-scale hide and seek game played within one of the world's largest malls.

## Game Setup and Objectives
The game involved 100 subscribers who were each given $10,000 upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. They were then locked inside a massive mall for 10 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, with the objective to survive until morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The seeker's (Jimmy's) objective was to find them; if found, the $10,000 was taken back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### Participants
*   **Hiders:** 100 subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, each with $10,000 at stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.
*   **Seekers:** Initially Jimmy and his team (Chandler, Karl, Nolan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Later joined by Sapnap, Marques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, and a SWAT team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### Location and Duration
The game took place in one of the largest malls in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, which included diverse areas like Lego Land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, Toys R Us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, an ice rink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, a ski resort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, a water park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, mini golf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, a theme park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, and candy stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. The challenge lasted for 10 hours, from evening until morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Seeker Strategies
The seekers employed various [[hide_and_seek_strategies | hide and seek strategies]] and [[bounty_hunting_challenges_and_strategies | bounty hunting strategies]] to locate the hiders across the massive mall.

### Initial Search Tactics
*   **Team Deployment:** Seekers spread out to cover different areas of the mall; for example, Chandler and Karl searched Toys R Us, while Jimmy checked the ice rink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Targeted Sweeps:** Teams focused on specific large sections like the ski resort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a> and water slides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Observation:** Paying attention to unusual details like a vending machine being far off the wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> or a blanket shaped like a human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### Advanced Search Methods
*   **Professional Backup:** A SWAT team was called in at 5:00 AM to sweep the theme park area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Thermal Drone:** The SWAT team utilized a thermal drone to scan areas and identify hidden individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### Motivation and Psychological Tactics
*   **Incentives for Seekers:** Jimmy offered his team a reward for finding more people (e.g., buying their moms a boat if they reduced the remaining hiders to under 30) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. The SWAT team was offered half the money from each person they found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   **Public Announcements:** Jack Black was recruited to announce over the mall's speakers that certain areas, like the water park, were closing, forcing hiders to move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   **Disguises and Deception:** Nolan dressed as a janitor to blend in and search for hiders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Jimmy also pretended he couldn't see to encourage hiders to reveal themselves in the final minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   **Bribery:** In the last minutes, Jimmy offered public bystanders money to reveal the location of hiders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## Hider Strategies and Challenges
The hiders focused on [[Strategies and hiding spots in large areas | strategies and hiding spots in large areas]] and [[Challenges and Hiding Strategies | creative hiding strategies and outcomes]] to remain undetected.

### Hiding Spots
*   **Common Retail Areas:** Hiders utilized various sections of the mall like Lego Land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a> and Toys R Us, hiding behind curtains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> or within stuffed animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Unconventional Spots:** Some hiders found very [[creative_hiding_strategies_and_outcomes | creative hiding strategies and outcomes]], such as:
    *   Climbing a ladder into the ceiling via a suspicious vending machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
    *   Making a "little fort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
    *   Hiding in trashcans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
    *   Concealing themselves under a zebra blanket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
    *   Behind mini golf boxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
    *   Under stairs and behind escalators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
    *   Under a stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
    *   Inside an It'Sugar box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### Evasion and Deception
*   **Running:** Hiders attempted to run away from seekers when spotted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **Lying:** Some hiders lied about whether others were present in their hiding area to protect fellow contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Endurance:** Many hiders remained in their spots for several hours, enduring fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Utilizing Open Hours:** The mall opening to the public in the final 30 minutes created an opportunity for hiders to blend in or [[escape_tactics_and_evasion_techniques | evade detection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### Challenges Faced by Hiders
*   **Large Area to Cover:** The sheer size of the mall provided many hiding spots but also meant hiders could be far from exits or resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **Seeker Persistence:** Seekers were highly motivated and thorough in their searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Advanced Tools:** The introduction of thermal drones posed a significant threat to hidden individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Forced Relocation:** Announcements closing areas like the water park forced hiders to abandon their spots and find new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Basic Needs:** Hiders faced challenges like needing to use the restroom, which could expose their location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Fatigue:** Remaining hidden and alert for 10 hours led to exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Game Outcomes
Despite extensive searching, many hiders successfully survived the 10-hour challenge and kept their $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. Out of an initial $1,000,000 at risk, approximately half a million dollars was ultimately given away to the surviving contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

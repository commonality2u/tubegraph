Fireworks vary significantly in their effects and the safety precautions required for their use. From small, inexpensive fireworks to world-record-setting displays, the experience can range from mildly entertaining to physically impactful and potentially dangerous.

## Safety Considerations

Launching fireworks, particularly large ones, involves several safety measures and potential hazards:
*   Individuals may become scared or run away from fireworks due to their noise and proximity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   Concerns about personal safety, including the possibility of death, have been expressed during firework launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   For extremely large fireworks, special clearances, such as [[worlds_largest_firework | FAA clearance]], are required to ensure no planes are in the sky during the launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   A minimum safe distance is often mandated; for example, participants were instructed to go 500 feet away from a 160-pound mortar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   Fireworks can sometimes explode prematurely or behave unexpectedly, as seen when rockets blew up instead of going up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   When launched in an enclosed space like a car, fireworks can ricochet wildly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a> and cause the vehicle to catch fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   Bulletproof glass has been used as a safety precaution during experiments involving fireworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   The scale of some firework displays raises questions about legality and public safety, with participants wondering how they are not arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## Effects of Fireworks

Fireworks create various sensory experiences and physical impacts:

### Visual Effects
*   Early fireworks produce basic effects, described as "kind of lame" for a $1 firework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   More expensive fireworks offer increasingly spectacular and colorful displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   A 160-pound mortar, requiring [[firework_launching_process | FAA clearance]], created an explosion that looked like a "nuke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   A large-scale launch of 150 fireworks simultaneously resulted in a "wild" visual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   A $10,000 firework show featured an entire display of "little popcorns" (shells) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   Launching 4,000 shells at once created the "coolest thing I've ever seen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   A $40,000 firework, containing over 9,000 shells, was described as "four times bigger" than the 4,000-shell launch and so bright that people had to back up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   The [[worlds_largest_firework | world's largest firework]], costing $160,000 and weighing 4,000 pounds, lit up the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>, was incredibly bright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, and caused "raining fire for like a mile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, visible for approximately a mile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

### Auditory and Physical Effects
*   Some fireworks produce shrieking noises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   The explosion of a firework in a microwave was "so loud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, with the sound reverberating and causing a "whoosh" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   The $10,000 firework show was described as "loud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   The sheer volume of multiple fireworks can cause temporary hearing loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   The [[worlds_largest_firework | world's largest firework]] produced a significant shockwave that could be felt in the chest even from 2,000 feet away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>, leaving individuals shaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a> and feeling their hearts realign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

## Other Firework-Related Activities

*   Attempts to launch objects using multiple rockets, such as a dummy named Manny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   Experimenting with fireworks inside a car to observe ricocheting and potential explosions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   Filling a car trunk with fireworks to create a massive explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   Microwaving a firework to see its effect, resulting in an explosion within the microwave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   [[drone_light_shows | Drone light shows]] are presented as an alternative to fireworks, capable of spelling words or displaying symbols in the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   Creating large-scale logos using hundreds of sparklers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

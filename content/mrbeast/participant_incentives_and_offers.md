Participants in a challenge involving 100 kids against 100 adults, competing to stay inside a cube for 100 hours, were presented with various incentives and offers throughout the duration of the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The primary goal was to have the most people remaining in their cube after 100 hours to win a share of half a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Only the remaining players on the winning team would split the half a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Initial Temptations

An hour into the challenge, a direct [[moneybased_competitions_and_incentives | monetary incentive]] was offered: a participant could receive $1,000 if they chose to exit the cube immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This was explicitly stated as the only time anyone would receive money unless their team won the main prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Participants had 60 seconds to decide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. While some participants, both kids and adults, chose to leave for the $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, many found the amount insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. After this initial offer, 12 adults and 10 kids had been eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Food-Based Offers and Challenges

Throughout the challenge, food became a significant incentive or disincentive:
*   **Oatmeal:** A consistently disliked oatmeal was served, which prompted some participants to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Taco Bell:** An offer was made to the kids: if two of them exited, everyone remaining in their cube would receive Taco Bell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. The kids initially refused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, though some still decided to leave independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Coffee:** For the adults, the offer was a cup of coffee for everyone if two adults exited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The adults readily accepted this offer, valuing caffeine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Pizza:** Later, a proposition was made to the kids: if they allowed their square to shrink, each person would receive a pizza for dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Despite some initially advocating for the "oatmeal" (i.e., not accepting the offer to avoid shrinking the zone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, the kids eventually agreed to the pizza deal, leading to their zone shrinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. The adults also received pizza as a reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Feastables:** With two hours left, Mr. Beast offered his brand's chocolate bars, Feastables, to participants who would say "Hershey sucks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

## [[Incentives and temptation during challenges | Temptation-Based Challenges]]

To test participants' resolve, several pranks involving perceived [[prize_incentives_and_participant_decisions | monetary incentives]] were introduced:
*   **Empty Briefcase:** An empty briefcase was displayed, implying a large sum of money to test [[incentives_and_temptation_during_challenges | temptation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. This resulted in some participants, both kids and adults, leaving the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Single Dollar:** A similar test was conducted with just a single dollar bill sticking out of a briefcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This also led to participants exiting, including a kid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **"Goofy" Empty Briefcase:** Another attempt was made with just an empty briefcase, aiming to see if anyone would leave for no reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. While the kids did not fall for this one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, some adults did leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

## Final Rewards and Surprises

As the challenge neared its end, an unapproved offer of $5,000 was made to one participant to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. Upon the conclusion of the 100-hour challenge, the adults were declared the winners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. As a [[surprise_prizes_and_offers_for_participants | surprise reward]] for staying the entire time, each adult on the winning team received an additional $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

### The "Skip" Button
A special "skip" button allows a contestant to bypass a punishment they don't like, but it can only be used once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

*   If a contestant is currently completing another challenge, they are exempt from getting pied in the face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   Some punishments come with a temporary restriction on pressing the main button. For example, a contestant who receives a one-hour massage cannot press the button for that hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

The game's structure, with its alternating rewards and challenges, contributes to a [[highstakes_game_show_formats | high-stakes game show format]] where [[decision_making_and_strategy_among_contestants | decision making and strategy among contestants]] is key, often leading to surprising outcomes and [[impact_of_surprise_rewards_and_twist_in_game_shows | twists]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

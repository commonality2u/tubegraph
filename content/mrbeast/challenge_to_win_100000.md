A major challenge involves a search for a $100,000 cash prize, sealed within a bank vault [00:00:00]. Contestants must navigate through various challenges to find the correct safe containing the money, with the prize intended for their fathers [00:00:33].

## The Challenges

The journey to the $100,000 vault involves a series of distinct challenges:

*   **Decoy Vault** Initially, contestants raced to be the first to touch a sealed bank vault containing over $100,000 [00:00:00]. However, this vault was merely a decoy, and touching it yielded nothing [00:00:29].
*   **Laser Obstacle Course** Contestants had to navigate through a room filled with disappearing and reappearing lasers, crossing when the lasers were temporarily off [00:00:40, 00:03:33]. Nolan successfully completed this stage [00:00:54].
*   **Mannequin Carry** After the laser challenge, the next stage involved carrying a mannequin [00:01:03].
*   **Red Solo Cup Key Hunt** Contestants entered a room filled with over 1 billion red solo cups, tasked with finding a hidden key to open a safe [00:01:12, 00:01:20]. Chandler found the key [00:01:41]. The safe revealed a conditional prize: if the main prize of $100,000 was won, the dad would also receive a Tesla [00:01:49].
*   **Falling Garage Door Race** Blindfolded, contestants had to race under a falling garage door [00:01:58]. Karl was the first to make it [00:02:07]. The safe awarded $10,000 in cash to his dad [00:02:13].
*   **Lego Tower Key Build** A key dangled above a mountain of Legos, requiring contestants to build a tower to reach it [00:02:23]. Someone successfully grabbed the key [00:03:06]. The safe's prize was a warning: failure to win the next challenge would result in elimination [00:03:17].
*   **"Electric Wire" Illusion** Contestants faced a "plunge of electric wires" protecting a vault [00:04:51]. These wires only reacted to metal, making them safe to touch, but a demonstration was used to scare the participants into believing they were dangerous [00:04:53, 00:05:04]. Chris ran straight through them without fear [00:05:08].
*   **Vote for Key Opener** In one room, contestants voted for who among them would open the safe, with the rule that they could not vote for themselves [00:05:26, 00:05:33]. Nolan won the vote with two votes [00:05:45]. The safe's prize was to proceed to the next room [00:05:57].
*   **Metal Detector Beach Key Hunt** Contestants used metal detectors on a giant indoor beach to find a hidden key [00:05:59]. Despite the key breaking, it counted [00:06:25]. The prize for this challenge was a $5,000 Home Depot gift card [00:06:30].

## Winning the Prize

The final stage of the challenge brought contestants back to the initial vault, now filled with the $100,000 cash prize [00:06:36, 00:06:42]. The rule remained: whoever touched the vault first would win its contents [00:06:54]. Nolan was the first to touch the vault [00:07:27], successfully winning the $100,000 for his dad [00:07:34]. Nolan's dad expressed his pride, calling him "the best bank robber ever" [00:07:42].

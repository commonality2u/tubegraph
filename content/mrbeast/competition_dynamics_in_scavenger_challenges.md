This competition features two contestants, Chris and Weddle, engaging in a large-scale [[dumpster_diving_competitions | dumpster diving competition]] to find the most valuable items over 100 dumpsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The objective is to accumulate the highest total monetary value from retrieved items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Competition Format and Rules
The challenge involves Chris and Weddle taking turns diving into dumpsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. A professional appraiser determines the monetary worth of each item found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The contestant who accumulates the most money wins the grand prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

The competition includes:
*   **Sequential Turns**: Contestants take turns selecting and searching dumpsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.
*   **Appraisal System**: A dedicated appraiser evaluates all found items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Later, a stand-in appraiser, "Chandler 2.0," provides valuations remotely via video call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Prize Evolution**: Initially, the prize was $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, which was later increased to $12,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Special Dumpsters**: Some larger dumpsters count as multiple (e.g., one counted as four) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   **Assisted Searching**: At later stages, the host or crew members assisted in searching dumpsters, especially for larger or particularly dirty ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## [[contestant_strategies_and_dynamics | Contestant Strategies and Dynamics]]
The competition showcases various [[contestant_competition_strategies | contestant strategies]] and dynamics:

*   **Early Lead and Comebacks**: Chris initially takes the lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, but Weddle quickly overtakes him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The lead frequently changes throughout the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   **Strategic Item Selection**: Contestants aim for items perceived as valuable, such as L.L.Bean slippers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, and furniture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Risk Assessment**: Contestants sometimes avoid overly gross or seemingly empty dumpsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, or those with perceived hazards like rats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **Psychological Warfare**: Contestants engage in minor taunts, such as Chris deliberately dropping a jar of smelly items into Weddle's dumpster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> and mocking item valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **Appraiser Influence**: The appraiser's valuations directly impact scores, leading to contestant reactions of surprise or dismay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The use of "Chandler 2.0" introduces a different, less professional appraisal style that sometimes overvalues common items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Fairness Debates**: Contestants sometimes dispute valuations, feeling they were "jibbed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a> or that bubbles should have been valued differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

## Final Outcome
The competition concluded after 100 dumpsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

> This event demonstrates [[unique_competition_formats | unique competition formats]] and how [[incentives_and_motivations_in_challenges | incentives and motivations in challenges]] drive contestant behavior in a large-scale, individual challenge. While not a typical "endurance challenge," the sheer number of dumpsters (100) does add an element of stamina, impacting [[competition_dynamics_in_endurance_challenges | competition dynamics in endurance challenges]] through sustained effort and psychological endurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The format also mirrors aspects of [[bounty_hunting_challenges_and_strategies | bounty hunting challenges and strategies]] where participants seek valuable finds.

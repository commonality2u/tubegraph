The cheese was particularly noted as "insane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28">[11:28]</a>.

## Overall Observations on Cost vs. Taste

While many of the gold-adorned dishes were enjoyed, there was a recurring observation that increased cost did not always equate to a proportionally better taste. For example, some higher-priced items like the `$3,000` pork, `$5,000` tacos, and `$6,000` short ribs were not as good as anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00">[09:00]</a>, leading to the conclusion that "more expensive food doesn't actually taste better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53">[08:53]</a>. However, the `$70,000` golden pizza was a notable exception, receiving overwhelmingly positive reviews for its flavor profile.

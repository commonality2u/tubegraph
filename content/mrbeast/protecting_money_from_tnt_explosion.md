One of the most daring experiments featured in the recent video involved the challenge of protecting $50,000 from a massive TNT explosion. This fascinating experiment combines ingenuity, thrilling suspense, and high stakes. Here's a breakdown of the events and techniques used in this explosive challenge.

## The Challenge 

The experiment tasked participant Will with protecting $50,000 from being obliterated by the surrounding TNT. Host Jimmy offered an open credit line, allowing Will to purchase any materials he deemed necessary to create a protective structure around the cash [[decision_making_and_honesty_in_high_stakes_situations | in high-stakes situations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Initial Defense Strategy

Will began his defense with 12 industrial water containers filled with 20,000 pounds of water. His initial thoughts were cautious, as water can absorb explosive energy effectively, but he was aware that it might not suffice against the explosive power of TNT [[problemsolving_strategies_in_highpressure_situations | in high-pressure situations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Augmented Defense: Seven-Layer Fortress

Over four days, with the assistance of professionals, Will constructed a seven-layer defensive fortress:

1. **First Layer**: Industrial water containers holding 20,000 pounds of water.
2. **Second Layer**: Mattresses, which added cushioning to absorb shock waves.
3. **Third Layer**: A cinder block wall to further absorb and distribute the impact.
4. **Fourth Layer**: Another set of mattresses for additional protection.
5. **Fifth Layer**: A second cinder block wall acting as a barrier to slow down collapsing materials.
6. **Sixth Layer**: 32,000 pounds of water in additional containers to bolster the defense.
7. **Seventh Layer**: Final wall constructed from dirt to provide a dense, solid barrier to withstand the explosion [[creative_problemsolving_and_resource_management_in_extreme_conditions | in extreme conditions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

## Unexpected Defense

Unbeknownst to Jimmy, Will added an unexpected layer using Feastables chocolate bars as an extra buffer, humorously suggesting that this sweet surprise might help dissipate the TNT energy [[using_creative_methods_to_complete_a_task | through creative methods]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## Doubling the Stakes

In an unexpected twist, Jimmy proposed doubling both the TNT and the reward to $100,000. If successful, Will would secure double the amount but risk total loss [[risk_and_reward_decision_making | if the enhanced explosion breached the defenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## The Outcome

The moment of truth arrived, and the TNT was detonated. A colossal explosion ensued, shrouding the area in smoke and debris. As the dust settled, it was discovered that astonishingly $95,000 of the money survived the annihilation, showcasing the effectiveness of Will's defense despite the odds [[successful_completion_of_a_highstakes_challenge | in a high-stakes challenge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

The slice was so large it was described as "taller than Carl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## The Challenge

The challenge involved renowned competitive eater Joey Chestnut attempting to finish his nine-pound slice of the world's largest pizza faster than Mr. Beast, Chris, and Chandler could collectively eat their identical slice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### Participants
*   **Joey Chestnut:** Known as the fastest competitive eater in the world, holding numerous world records, including for hot dogs eaten and for holding the most world records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. He was described as a "freak of nature" and "the best eater in the entire world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. At the start of the challenge, Joey weighed 229 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   **Mr. Beast and Friends:** Initially, the team consisted of Mr. Beast, Chris, and Chandler. Their combined weight before the challenge was 537 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. They were confident they could "easily be able to out-eat Joey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. As the challenge progressed, additional helpers were brought in:
    *   A fourth person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>
    *   Tyler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>
    *   Jackson, Tyler's friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>
    *   Dustin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>
    This brought the total number of people competing against Joey to seven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### Progress of the Challenge
From the start, Joey Chestnut adopted a folding technique to eat the pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. He quickly outpaced the team of Mr. Beast and friends, who struggled with the sheer volume and texture of the pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Despite multiple attempts to slow Joey down, including offering him $10,000 to stop for five minutes, he remained focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. The team found the challenge extremely difficult, with some members expressing pain, feeling full, and even gagging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

Mr. Beast offered his team $100,000 if they managed to beat Joey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Outcome
Joey Chestnut successfully finished the entire six-foot, nine-pound pizza slice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. He maintained a rhythm by using water to help swallow the food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. His win was encouraged by the increasing number of competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

After the challenge, Joey Chestnut's weight increased from 229 pounds to 250 pounds, a gain of 21 pounds of pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. He described feeling "bloated, tired," and "exhausted," anticipating a need for recovery time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

In contrast, Mr. Beast and his friends, despite having started at a combined 537 pounds, only increased to 547 pounds, gaining a collective 10 pounds, and still lost the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

To commemorate Joey's victory, he was awarded a pizza-themed trophy, which he stated was "one of the hardest trophies" he had ever had to get, despite his extensive collection of belts and trophies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

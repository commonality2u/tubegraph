This article details various personal stories of individuals who underwent sight-restoring surgeries, highlighting the profound impact these procedures had on their lives. The surgeries, often quick and simple, provided many with the ability to see clearly for the first time in years, or even since birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22"></a>.

The initiative aimed to cure the blindness of 1,000 people from around the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00"></a>. Approximately half of all cases of blindness globally are due to conditions that can be resolved with a 10-minute surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28"></a>. The procedure involves a surgeon using a tiny vacuum to remove the clouded lens from the eye and replace it with an artificial one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44"></a>.

## Individual Experiences

### Initial Patient
One of the first individuals to receive the surgery was a woman who, upon regaining her sight, exclaimed, "I see everybody!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35"></a>. She noted, "I can see clearer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36"></a> and was so overcome with joy that she wanted to "jump for joy!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38"></a>. In addition to her restored vision, she received an unexpected gift of $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13"></a>.

### Seeing a Watch for the First Time
Another recipient of the surgery joyfully observed, "There's my watch. I've never seen it before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26"></a>, highlighting the simple, yet profound, details they could now perceive.

### Overcoming Night Blindness
A man who had suffered from night blindness his entire life, stating he "just deal[t] with it for life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32"></a>, was amazed post-surgery. He reported "No cloudiness, no blurriness. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57"></a> Oh, it's perfect. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59"></a> I can see everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01"></a>, discarding his glasses with delight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04"></a>.

### Charlie, the Cashier
Charlie, who worked as a cashier, had found his [[impact_of_visual_impairement_on_daily_life | vision impairment]] so severe that he couldn't accurately count money for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25"></a>. His main desire was to regain his vision so he could return to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30"></a>. After his [[curing_blindness_through_surgery | successful surgery]], he was able to read a sign that revealed he had won $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54"></a>. He expressed, "It feels good. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01"></a> I didn't think I was ever gonna be able to see again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02"></a>.

### A Father's Desire to See His Son
One patient shared that the first thing he was excited to see after surgery was his son, who had been his "rock through all of this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32"></a>. After the operation, he was visibly emotional upon seeing his son's face clearly, describing it as "what I miss you know" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43"></a>. He could now see "everybody's facial features" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58"></a>, even through tears of joy.

### Jeremiah's Lifelong Challenge
Jeremiah had been blind in his right eye since birth due to cataracts, affecting his vision his entire life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11"></a>. Because his eye had never received light, his surgery had only a 50% chance of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20"></a>. After the procedure, he said, "Everything looks so more clear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28"></a>. As he was about to graduate high school and attend college, he was surprised with $50,000 to put towards his education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34"></a>, feeling like it wasn't real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43"></a>.

### Satchel's Dream of Driving
Satchel suffered from poor vision since birth and almost lost his entire vision after a go-karting accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37"></a>. He explained that his vision was "blur and color" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42"></a> and that his [[impact_of_visual_impairement_on_daily_life | blindness prevented him from driving]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46"></a>, confining him to home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55"></a>. Post-surgery, he could see without any blur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57"></a> and could clearly see cars "all the way over there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14"></a>. To help him achieve his dream, Satchel was surprised with a brand new Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33"></a>. Despite never having driven a car before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44"></a>, he successfully drove the car, demonstrating his newfound freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55"></a>.

## Global Impact and Charitable Giving
The effort extended beyond America to other parts of the world where nearly half the population with curable blindness lacks access to this essential surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04"></a>. A significant donation of $100,000 was made, intended to bring sight to thousands more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37"></a>.

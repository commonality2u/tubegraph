The competition culminated in a final game of musical chairs, a departure from the original Squid Game's final challenge. This decision was made because the contestants were not Korean, making musical chairs a more universally understood game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.

## Participants & Stakes

Six contestants remained for the final challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. The ultimate prize at stake was $456,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. Before the game, contestants shared their motivations and strategies, with many planning to give a significant portion of their winnings to family and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. One contestant also pledged to donate $10,000 to TEAMSEAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.

## Musical Chairs: Rules and Eliminations

The rules for musical chairs were straightforward: contestants circled chairs while music played, and when the music stopped, they had to sit in an available chair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. Karl, one of the hosts, was responsible for stopping the music and was instructed not to look at the contestants to avoid bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>.

Several [[contestant_eliminations_and_reasons | eliminations]] occurred during the game:

*   The first contestant was eliminated when the music stopped and he did not secure a chair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>, leaving five remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.
*   Another contestant was eliminated due to his honesty, admitting he didn't secure a chair when he briefly stood up, even though the music hadn't officially stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.
*   A third contestant was eliminated for sitting down too early, before Karl had stopped the music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>.
*   When only three people and two chairs remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>, a close contest saw one player eliminated. They claimed the other two "plotted" against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

## The Final Two and Winner

The competition came down to the final two players competing for one chair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>. The tension was high, with the hosts acknowledging the gravity of Karl's decision to stop the music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.

In the climactic moment, contestant 079 successfully secured the final chair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>, winning the $456,000 prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. The runner-up received a consolation prize of $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

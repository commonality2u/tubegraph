The Survival Condo Project, located in a former missile silo from the 1950s, has been transformed into a 14-story luxury underground bunker designed to withstand a nuclear strike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Its purpose is to provide a secure and comfortable refuge "if the world ended" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## [[security_measures_in_luxury_bunkers | Security Measures]]
Access to the bunker is highly restricted, involving multiple layers of [[security_measures_in_luxury_bunkers | security measures in luxury bunkers]]. The primary entrance features an incredibly thick door, described as something "you couldn't break into... if you had a thousand years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This first door alone weighs 16,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Beyond this, there are at least three more doors, culminating in a "steel bolted vault door" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The entire facility is monitored 24/7 with "top of the line surveillance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Each of the bunker's floors is protected by nine-foot-thick walls, ensuring that "ain't nobody getting in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

## [[doomsday_bunker_lifestyle | Living Conditions]] and Amenities
The bunker offers a wide range of [[highend_amenities_in_multimillion_dollar_homes | high-end amenities in multimillion dollar homes]] and facilities, designed to support a comfortable [[doomsday_bunker_lifestyle | doomsday bunker lifestyle]] for extended periods:

### Residential Units
The residential floors feature luxury condos that cost between one and two and a half million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. These units can support up to 10 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a> and are designed to feel like a "normal house" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, complete with simulated "windows of the outside" that are actually large screens displaying the outside world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. The beds are described as being "probably the most comfortable bed in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

### Recreation and [[entertainment_facilities_in_underground_shelters | Entertainment Facilities in Underground Shelters]]

### Food and [[selfsustaining_agriculture_in_bunkers | Self-Sustaining Agriculture]]
The bunker prioritizes [[selfsustaining_agriculture_in_bunkers | selfsustaining agriculture in bunkers]]:
*   **Food Storage**: Large quantities of stored food are available, such as "47 servings of apples" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a> and "scrambled eggs in a can" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Aquaponics System**: The bunker includes an "underground fish market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a> and a system to "grow plants for the entire bunker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This system is self-sustaining, where fish waste is used to grow plants, and plants provide food for the fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Cooking Facilities**: Residents can harvest their own greens and use pre-harvested fish to prepare meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

## Experience of [[living_in_a_nuclear_bunker_for_100_days | Living in a Nuclear Bunker]]
Despite being 11 stories underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, the bunker feels like a "normal house" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. The participants reported sleeping soundly, with one even claiming it was "10 times better" than sleeping outside a bunker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. The environment is designed to minimize the feeling of being isolated or confined, making a [[living_in_a_nuclear_bunker_for_100_days | living in a nuclear bunker for 100 days]] or longer seem manageable.

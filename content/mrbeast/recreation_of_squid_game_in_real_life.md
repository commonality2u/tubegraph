Mr. Beast undertook a massive project to [[Creative challenges for entertainment | recreate every single set]] from the popular show *Squid Game* in real life, turning it into a [[Survival challenge for money | competition]] for 456 participants vying for a grand prize of $456,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The [[Creative stunts and highrisk video challenges | challenges]] were designed to mirror those in the show, with players eliminated from the competition if they failed, indicated by a device strapped to them that "pops" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Games and Challenges

### Red Light, Green Light

The first game was "Red Light, Green Light," where contestants had 30 minutes to cross a red line at the other side of a large room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Players had to freeze when "red light" was called and could only move during "green light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Moving during "red light" resulted in elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. A "yellow light" was also introduced to trick players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Over 100 people were eliminated in this round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Ultimately, 232 participants survived this initial [[Challenges of extreme survival scenarios | challenge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

### Honeycomb

In the "Honeycomb" game, each player received a needle and a cookie with a different shape on it (circle, star, triangle, umbrella) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. They had 10 minutes to remove the shape from the cookie without breaking it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Breaking the shape led to elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Some contestants displayed nervousness, especially with the umbrella shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. A lighter was covertly introduced by a staff member to help a contestant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Eliminated players in this round received $2,000 in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This round saw 142 survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Mr. Beast then offered a $4,000 incentive for anyone to voluntarily leave within five minutes to "weed out some of the weak people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

### Tug of War

For "Tug of War," the remaining players were divided into groups of 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. Teams were formed strategically, with some seeking strong and intelligent members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Teams faced off on a bridge above a foam pit, and if a team fell into the foam or their flag crossed to the other side, they were eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Notable players like "456" (the main character's number from the show) and "067" survived this round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. One match was so intense that the set itself broke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This game reduced the number of contestants from 120 to 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

### Marbles

The "Marbles" game introduced an emotional twist: players were forced to partner with their "best friend" from the challenge, as monitored by Mr. Beast's team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. Each pair received 10 marbles, and they had to agree on a game to play against each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. The goal was to acquire 20 marbles to move on, meaning one person had to eliminate their best friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. Many played traditional marble games like "odd or even," while others got [[Game mechanics and challenges in survival scenarios | creative]], like throwing marbles at bricks for points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Some even resorted to a coin flip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Eliminated players received $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

### Ddakji

Instead of the show's brawl, Mr. Beast opted for "Ddakji" as the fourth game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. Players used a blue paper piece to flip a red one on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. The first 16 to successfully flip their red square advanced to the next round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. This game was sponsored by Brawl Stars, which helped fund the video, costing over $3.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

### Glass Bridge

The "Glass Bridge" was a visually stunning and tense game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. Sixteen winners from Ddakji were assigned numbers (in Korean) by picking them off mannequins arranged randomly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. These numbers dictated their crossing order on the bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. Players had to choose between two platforms, one that would hold them and one that would drop them into a giant foam pit below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. As time ran out, players hesitated, refusing to move forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. At the zero-second mark, four people were still on the platforms and were eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.

## The Final Game: Musical Chairs

Six finalists, having survived the previous [[Extreme Games | challenges]], were treated to a steak dinner (with plastic knives for safety) to prepare for the final game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. The chosen final game was "Musical Chairs," selected because the contestants were not Korean, making the original *Squid Game* final game less relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. Eliminated players were ceremoniously placed in a coffin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. The game continued until only two players remained, circling a single chair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>.

Ultimately, contestant "079" won the final round, claiming the $456,000 prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. The second-place finisher received a $10,000 consolation prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. Mr. Beast acknowledged the original *Squid Game* creator for providing significant inspiration for the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>.

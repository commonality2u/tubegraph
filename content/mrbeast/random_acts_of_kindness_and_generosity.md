A social experiment involved giving random individuals an "unlimited" credit card, leading to moments of shock, excitement, and significant [[amazing_giveaways_and_charitable_acts | generosity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The participants were told there was a hidden limit, and if they exceeded it, they would lose everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Unbeknownst to them, the card had no actual limit, allowing for [[spending_and_generosity_in_unexpected_situations | generous spending]] on desired items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Unrestricted Spending in Retail Stores

### Target Shopping Spree
In a Target store, participants were given the credit card with the "limit" condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. They initially estimated a low limit, around $200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, and were conservative with their choices. The content creators encouraged them to [[shopping_sprees_for_individuals_in_need | spend more]], hinting at higher value items like a TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> and iPads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The final purchase totaled $5,915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Upon approval, participants were ecstatic, only to be surprised further when told there was no limit at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This created a memorable [[experiences_of_receiving_unexpected_gifts | experience]] for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Lego Store Adventure
The experiment continued at a Lego store, where customers were given the same "limited" credit card offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. After some initial hesitation, they were encouraged to purchase large and expensive Lego sets, including the Statue of Liberty and the Millennium Falcon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The total came to $3,494.90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The approval of the transaction resulted in immense excitement and relief for the participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Designer Store Splurge
At a high-end designer store, a participant and his mother were invited to shop with the "limited" card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. They were encouraged to select expensive items such as a $500 wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, an $850 hoodie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, and $1,100 shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Believing the limit was around $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, they carefully managed their selections. The final total was $5,013.94, which they adjusted to just under $5,000 to avoid exceeding their perceived limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The transaction was approved, leading to joy, especially from the participant's mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. The revelation that there was no limit surprised the participant, who was content with what he had received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### Art Gallery First Date
A couple on their first date was given the "limited" credit card at an art gallery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. They considered expensive art pieces, including one for $18,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a> and another for $26,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. They aimed to stay under a perceived limit of $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. The final total was $15,786.87 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. The card was approved, allowing them to own the chosen art pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. The date was described as "unexpected, but I love it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

### Jewelry Store Visit
A man on the street was given the credit card and directed to a jewelry store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. He revealed his mother had Stage 4 cancer and wished to buy her a necklace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. He selected a necklace for about $7,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a> and then two pinky rings, aiming to keep the total under $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. The jeweler offered a package deal for $8,999.99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. The card was approved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The man expressed profound gratitude, stating that he could now give his mother something special before she passed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, embodying the spirit of [[charitable_donations_to_people_in_need | charitable donations]] and [[charity_and_paying_it_forward | paying it forward]].

## Grand Gestures of Generosity

### Gifting a Car
An individual named Andre, who had previously assisted with videos, was unexpectedly presented with the credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. He was surprised, thinking the limit might be around $10,000 to $11,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. They went to a car dealership, where Andre chose a Toyota valued at $15,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Before attempting to pay, it was revealed that car dealerships do not accept credit cards, and the real purpose was to [[surprising_people_with_free_cars_and_merchandise | buy him the car outright]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Andre was "completely flabbergasted" by the [[surprising_customers_with_gifts_and_unforeseen_rewards | unexpected gift]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a> and praised the creators for "making a whole lotta people happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

### Best Buy Extravaganza
At a Best Buy store, a participant was given the credit card with the standard "limit" premise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. She initially thought the limit might be around $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a> but was encouraged to buy more, including a large TV for $879 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a> and two MacBook Pros for her boyfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. The main cameraman was eventually "kicked out" of the store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>, but the shopping continued discreetly. Her total came to $3,971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>, which was approved. She was thrilled to keep all the items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>, and was later informed the card had no limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

## Unexpected Tips and Collectibles

### Restaurant Tip
At a restaurant, the waiter was given the opportunity to write any tip amount on the credit card, with the caveat that it would be declined if it went "over the limit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. The waiter considered it "absurd" to write a large tip but eventually decided on $1,575, bringing the total bill to $1,999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. The card was approved, and the waiter was deeply grateful for the [[surprising_customers_with_gifts_and_unforeseen_rewards | generous tip]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

### Collectibles Store Spree
At a collectibles store, a fan was given the credit card and the same "limit" explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. The participant was encouraged to fill a box with items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. He selected various items including a Boba Fett shirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>, classic video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>, a $3,000 Captain America statue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>, a Darth Vader mini-fridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>, and a Mandalorian Pop! figure set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. The total for his selections was $6,595 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. Despite his nervousness, the card was approved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>, leading to his excitement and gratitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

A competition for half a million dollars in cash involved a large-scale game of tag played within a massive stadium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The objective was for contestants to evade being tagged, with the last person remaining winning the entire prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Initial Format: Stadium Tag
The contest featured finalists from a previous video, who had earned their spot by sitting in a circle for 12 days straight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The game of tag took place in a stadium large enough to fit over 160,000 people, spanning three floors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Initially, only the host, Jimmy, was "it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Adapting the [[Challenge format and rules | Challenge Format]]

### Adding Taggers
Due to the immense size of the stadium and the difficulty in finding contestants, the host introduced additional taggers to assist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Chris and Chandler were brought in as reinforcements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Later, as the competition extended into the night, SapNap and Carl replaced Chris and Chandler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### GPS Tracking Implementation
After hours of searching and only a few contestants being tagged, the host activated GPS trackers that had been placed on all contestants' phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. While this led to the successful tagging of at least one person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, the trackers had a 10-second delay, still allowing contestants to move away before the taggers could reach their location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Shrinking the Arena
Recognizing that the stadium was still too vast and the game was taking too long, the host decided to drastically shrink the playable area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Contestants were given 10 minutes to relocate to just the racetrack within the stadium, turning the game into a more direct chase rather than hide-and-seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The host counted down the 10 minutes with eyes closed from the middle of the racetrack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Contestant Strategies
*   **Alliances:** Some contestants formed alliances, creating triangular formations to avoid being caught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Hiding:** Contestants initially tried to hide in various parts of the stadium, including electrical boxes and VIP suites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Mobility:** After the area was shrunk, contestants prioritized staying mobile to evade the taggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Creative Evasion:** One contestant attempted to steal a golf cart and then a Lamborghini to escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Another used a U-Haul for cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

## Conclusion
Ultimately, after 24 hours of competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>, Lincoln was the last contestant remaining and won the $500,000 cash prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>, in addition to a new car and $10,000 cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

Upon being dropped off in an abandoned city for a seven-day challenge, the primary objectives were to [[outdoor_survival_skills | explore]] the city to find and establish a safe place to call home, and later, to [[building_shelters_in_harsh_conditions | improve]] and [[building_shelters_and_finding_resources | fortify]] that shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The city was abandoned due to war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Initial Shelter Setup

The first step involved exploring the initial building where they were dropped off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. After some exploration, they found an area that seemed suitable for a shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This spot offered views of the city and a roof for rain protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

With the [[setting_up_camp_and_creating_shelter | home base]] decided, the next task was to open a supplies crate left by a helicopter on the roof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This crate contained all the [[finding_food_and_resources_in_the_wild | survival gear]] needed for the week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. They created an assembly line to drop items down from the roof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

Initial camp setup included:
*   Making a fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   Searching for something to sleep on, finding one mattress and using wooden doors for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

Despite the initial setup, eerie sounds of breaking glass were heard during the first night, leading to suspicions that they might not be alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Additionally, the first shelter was too windy for comfortable sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Search for a New Shelter

Due to the wind and mysterious noises, a new shelter was sought on day two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. A drone was deployed to scout unexplored buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. During this exploration, they observed the vastness of the city, including abandoned hotels, a pool, and a soccer field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

After a full day of searching, a more [[construction_and_defense_strategies | fortified]] and suitable location was found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This new room was chosen because it offered better protection from the cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. It required significant effort to move all the gear from the old location to the new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

By nightfall, not all resources could be moved, leaving them with limited supplies at the new base, primarily water and canned chili <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. However, the new spot was much warmer and free from wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Shelter Renovation and Furnishing

On day five, with fewer people in the group due to resource limitations, the objective shifted to renovating and windproofing the new shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. The plan was to:
*   Put up tarps to make the room windproof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   Build a fireplace for heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
*   Find shelves and tables to make the place feel more like a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

Nearby buildings were explored to find furnishings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. Discoveries included:
*   A shelf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   A small table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   A massive carpet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   A metal object found by a cameraman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
*   A working chair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   A fake TV frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   Materials to construct a fireplace using a vent system and other metal pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
*   Wallpaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

The team spent four hours clearing rubble from the shelter before decorating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. Key renovations included:
*   A clean shelf for food storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
*   A table for water bottles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
*   A new door and a large tarp installed to block wind and retain heat from the fireplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
*   A fireplace using "redneck engineering" to vent smoke out while heating the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
*   Beds were made smaller to fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.
*   An iPad was placed in the TV frame for entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.
*   Additional lighting was set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

The modified shelter was significantly warmer, at least ten degrees warmer, allowing for much better sleep on the sixth day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. This successful [[building_shelter_and_protection_against_the_wind | building of shelter and protection against the wind]] transformed their survival experience.

## Continued Exploration

Throughout their stay, exploration was a continuous activity:
*   On day one, they explored the initial building to find a safe home base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   On day three, they continued exploring the city, including a beach area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   They used a drone to scout new buildings for a more suitable shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   They investigated a large, abandoned hotel, once a first-class vacation resort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   They found a bike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   They explored nearby buildings to find furnishings for their renovated shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.
*   On their last full day, they engaged in recreational exploration, including kayaking in the abandoned pool, playing baseball and soccer, and screaming across the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.

Overall, the process of finding, moving, and improving their shelter, combined with continuous exploration, defined their experience in the abandoned city.

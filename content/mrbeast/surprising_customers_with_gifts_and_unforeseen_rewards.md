At the world's first free restaurant, customers were not only served food without charge but were also [[spending_and_generosity_in_unexpected_situations | paid to eat]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This unique approach led to a mile of traffic and a thousand cars in line before the restaurant even opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The operation, managed by individuals with no prior restaurant experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, consistently offered [[surprise_giveaways_and_prizes | surprise rewards]] to patrons.

## Initial Generosity

From the outset, the restaurant's team began [[random_acts_of_kindness_and_generosity | surprising people with free cars and merchandise]] and money.
*   **Compensation for Waiting**
    Due to delays in preparing food, the first customers were given $100 for waiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, which quickly increased to another $100 when further delays occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Direct Cash Handouts**
    As the line grew, stacks of cash were given away to people waiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Crew members went directly to cars, handing out burgers and money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. If no burgers were available, customers still received $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Empowering Generosity**
    One team member, Chandler, who ran out of money, was immediately given $200,000 to continue distributing funds until food supply caught up with demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Unforeseen Choices and Escalated Rewards

Customers were given unique choices, leading to [[surprise_rewards_and_risktaking_in_games | unexpected wins]].
*   **"Would You Rather" Challenge**
    Customers were presented with two bags: one containing a burger and the other containing AirPods and a significant amount of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Even after picking the bag with money and AirPods, the customer was allowed to also receive the food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Expanding the Giveaways**
    When a second service window was opened, competition ensued among staff to give away bigger [[surprise_prizes_and_offers_for_participants | prizes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This led to customers receiving two iPads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, a burger with a brand new iPad and cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, and even an entire cash register full of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. If napkins ran out, money was simply put in the bags instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Addressing Customer Issues with Major Surprises

The long lines and wait times led to several customer vehicle issues, which were met with significant unexpected [[experiences_of_receiving_unexpected_gifts | gifts]].
*   **New Car for an Accident Victim**
    A family whose car was side-swiped while waiting in line was given a new car, which had been purchased on impulse that morning specifically for a giveaway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The recipient expressed deep emotion, stating she had "worked hard for everything" and didn't "get nothing handed" to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This demonstrated the significant [[impact_of_surprise_gifts_on_recipients_lives | impact of surprise gifts on recipients' lives]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **Gas for Stranded Vehicles**
    A car that ran out of gas while waiting in line was promptly filled up by a crew member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **Money for Car Repairs**
    A customer whose car broke down (turning on but then turning off) received $10,000 to fix it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

## The Final Customers

Even as the restaurant had to close early due to traffic congestion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>, the spirit of generosity continued. The final 30 customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, and specifically the very last customers, received not only their burgers but also a substantial amount of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>, marking a grand finale to the day of [[winning_a_prize_unexpectedly | surprising prizes]] and free food.

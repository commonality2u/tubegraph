In an intriguing experiment, the video demonstrates the ambitious and somewhat chaotic endeavor of [[challenges_involving_orbeez | filling an entire backyard with Orbeez]]. This project involved a mind-boggling number of these water-absorbing polymer beadsâ€”specifically, 100 million Orbeez.

## The Journey Begins: 100 Million Orbeez

The project starts with the grand presentation of 100 million Orbeez. Each box contains a million Orbeez, and the video showcases numerous boxes lined up meticulously [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">00:00:15</a>]. What makes this project fascinating is that Orbeez expand up to 30 times their original size when soaked in water [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">00:00:36</a>]. 

## Preparing the Backyard

The team embarked on the task by laying out tarps across the backyard to hold the Orbeez, planning to utilize an expected night's rain to activate the growth of the pellets [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">00:02:14</a>]. Their aim was to fill the entire backyard, creating a surreal space filled with these colorful spheres [[humor_and_pranks_with_orbeez | and playful pranks]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">00:03:51</a>].

## Initial Results and Challenges

The morning after setting up the Orbeez, thanks to daylight savings combined with early nightfall, the initial batch placed into a pool had swollen significantly [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">00:01:59</a>]. Spectators were amazed at how, from a handful, the Orbeez grew to occupy a substantial area [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">00:02:04</a>]. With only a fraction of the total Orbeez so far utilizing available space, the team continued pouring the remaining Orbeez onto tarps [[using_creative_methods_to_complete_a_task | showcasing creative problem-solving]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">00:03:53</a>]. 

## The Orbeez Pool and Playful Experiments

As the Orbeez continued to expand, the backyard transformed into a massive playground. The team engaged in numerous challenges and activities within the Orbeez-filled pool [[creative_games_to_win_prizes_and_money | using unique ideas and games]] to entertain the viewers [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">00:08:19</a>]. These included tight-rope challenges over the Orbeez and attempting to snorkel through them [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">00:09:00</a>]. These playful endeavors showcased both the entertaining and impractical nature of the experiment.

## Lessons and Environmental Considerations

Despite the lighthearted and comedic tone, the team was careful to address [[environmental_considerations_of_using_orbeez | environmental concerns]]. They noted that Orbeez are biodegradable and took responsibility for proper cleanup [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">00:13:43</a>]. This aspect was crucial to ensure that the entertaining spectacle did not result in negative environmental impacts.

## Conclusion: A Spectacle of Scale

The experiment was a testament to creative ambition, demonstrating both the fun and challenges involved in filling a backyard with Orbeez. While extravagant and unconventional, it underscored the importance of considering environmental impacts when conducting large-scale activities, ensuring that the fun doesn't come with a heavy ecological price [[the_value_of_material_vs_experiential_rewards | understanding the balance between material cost and experience value]].

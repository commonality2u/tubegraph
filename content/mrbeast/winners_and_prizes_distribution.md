## Additional Prizes and Offers

Throughout the challenge, various offers and unexpected prizes were introduced:

*   **Mid-Challenge Lure**: A briefcase containing $10,000 was placed in the middle of the hospital as a lure for the final four participants. Anyone who grabbed it would have to carry it around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. Most participants recognized this as a trap and did not fall for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **[[surprise_prizes_and_offers_for_participants | Sapnap's Offer for Information]]**: [[Prize incentives and participant decisions | Sapnap]] attempted to broker a deal, offering information on Karl's location in exchange for a channel tweet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

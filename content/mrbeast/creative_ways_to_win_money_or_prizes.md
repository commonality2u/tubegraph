## Physical Endurance and Strength Challenges

### Carrying Cash
In one challenge, participants are given a "never-ending giant mountain of cash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> and can keep as much as they can carry by stuffing it into their pockets, hoodies, pants, or shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. One participant managed to carry $6,751 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Another participant, Nolan, similarly stuffed his pants with money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### Stacking Cash on a Tray
A waitress was challenged to stack as much money as she could on a tray without setting it down, with the condition that if it fell, she would lose it all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. She managed to stack $8,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, pushing her luck by adding more money despite the risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Loading Bags with Cash
Coworkers of the waitress were invited to a warehouse where they had one minute to fill bags with as much money as they could carry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. One participant even dove into the pile of cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### Holding Heavy Duffel Bags of Cash
Two individuals were given duffel bags, each containing 50 pounds of money, totaling $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The [[challenge_to_win_money | challenge]] was to see who could hold their bag up the longest; the first to set it down would lose their portion, while still having to film the entire video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### Bench Pressing Money
A participant named Frank was challenged to bench press as much money as he could, with each stack weighing $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. He started with $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, increasing to $21,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. He attempted two repetitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, but due to assistance, one portion of the money was confiscated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### Deadlifting a Car

He successfully lifted the vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a> and was able to keep it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

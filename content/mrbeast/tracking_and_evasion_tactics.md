The video features a [[bounty_hunting_challenge | chase between a professional bounty hunter]] and Mr. Beast, with a prize of $100,000 on the line. This [[high_stakes_competitions | high-stakes pursuit]] showcases various tracking and evasion tactics employed by both parties. Below, we explore these tactics in detail, highlighting their execution throughout the chase.

## Tracking Tactics

### GPS Tracking

One of the primary methods used by the bounty hunter team to track Mr. Beast involves GPS tracking. A tracker was placed on Mr. Beast's phone, allowing the hunters to follow his movements in real-time. This is mentioned early in the video when the bounty hunters realize they can monitor his location after he buys a new car:

> [00:00:48] "All right guys, good news. I put a tracker on his phone. We know exactly where he is, and we can follow him now."

The bounty hunters continuously rely on this tracking method, adjusting their strategy based on the information gathered through the GPS system. This tactic is crucial in consistently pinning down Mr. Beast's location.

### Surveillance and Observation

Besides GPS tracking, the bounty hunters use [[observational_strategies_in_contained_environments | observation and surveillance techniques]] to deduce Mr. Beast's actions. By questioning contacts and using their surroundings, they piece together Mr. Beastâ€™s plans:

> [00:01:18] "And the guy that sold me the car started to talk."

Such interactions provide invaluable insights that augment electronic tracking, revealing that Mr. Beast purchased a Kia Soul, and giving the hunters leads on his cover and intended transportation choices.

### Deciphering Diversions

While closing in on Mr. Beast, the bounty hunters are often met with diversions that obscure the true location. An instance of this occurs with the complex porta-potty setup involving a helicopter:

> [00:07:58] "But what they don't know, behind that bush is actually another car."

The bounty hunters mistakenly believe Mr. Beast is in the porta-potty, leading them to incorrectly chase the helicopter while he escapes using a car parked nearby.

## Evasion Tactics

### Vehicle Changes

One of the main tactics Mr. Beast employs to evade capture is by frequently changing vehicles. This strategy is first seen when he swaps his car at a dealership, a move designed to throw off pursuers expecting the original vehicle:

> [00:00:45] "The first thing we're do is go to the closest dealership and buy a new car."

### Decoys and False Leads

Mr. Beast uses [[strategies_for_evading_capture_through_disguises_and_decoys | clever decoys]] to mislead the bounty hunters, creating confusion and buying time. A notable instance of this is when he stages a fake escape from a vault through a secret tunnel, while decoys are left behind to distract:

> [00:02:05] "What the boys didn't know was that there was a secret tunnel under the safe, and Tariq and I escaped out the back."

This tactic effectively leverages physical and psychological misdirection to maintain a lead over the trackers.

### Environmental Advantage

Capitalizing on his surroundings, Mr. Beast utilizes environmental features to his advantage, such as when he orchestrates an escape through dense woods and fields:

> [00:07:06] "And now we book it!"

By using the terrain as natural cover, he slows down the pursuers and enhances concealment.

### Surveillance Countermeasures

Employing video surveillance of his own, Mr. Beast monitors the bounty hunters' movements, allowing him to make informed decisions about when and where to move next:

> [00:09:06] "I have access to the security cameras of the movie theater on my phone."

This tactic turns the tables by [[escape_strategies_in_challenges | using counter-surveillance to stay]] one step ahead of the chasers.

## Conclusion

The chase between Mr. Beast and the bounty hunters is an exemplary display of modern tracking and evasion tactics. Through the combination of technology, situational awareness, and strategic planning, both parties demonstrate effective methods of pursuit and escape. These tactics underscore the [[psychological_and_physical_challenges_of_endurance_competitions | challenge and thrill]] inherent in high-stakes chases.

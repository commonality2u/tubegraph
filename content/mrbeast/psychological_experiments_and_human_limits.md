An individual undertook a seven-day [[psychological_and_physical_challenges | psychological and physical challenge]] to test the limits of [[human_endurance_and_motivation | human endurance and motivation]] by spending a week in solitary confinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This [[challenges_and_social_experiments | challenge]] involved being sealed in a soundproof, white room with no human contact or stimulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## The Experiment Setup

The room was deliberately designed to be devoid of stimulation. The subject was provided only with:
*   A bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>
*   A notebook and pen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>
*   A refillable water bottle, toothbrush, toothpaste, and a bar of soap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>
*   A toilet and sink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>

Food was delivered via a 100-foot conveyor belt to ensure zero human interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The room was soundproof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a> and constantly lit, impacting the subject's ability to sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Psychological Risks and Dangers

A doctor with 23 years of experience in psych hospitals stated that this experiment was "much worse than anything I've ever seen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Key risks identified include:
*   **Permanent psychological damage** Anything beyond 50 hours in such a room can lead to this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The subject aimed for 168 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Psychosis** There was a chance the subject could lose their mind and enter a state of psychosis, requiring immediate removal to prevent permanent damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Brain's response to lack of information** Without incoming information, the brain "generates craziness," including hallucinations and paranoia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This environment was considered much harder than being buried alive, due to the lack of social contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## The Subject's Experience and Deterioration

### Early Stages (Day 1-2)
The subject quickly realized the difficulty in entertaining himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Counting:** As early as hour nine, he resorted to counting wall tiles (1,900 on walls, 2,860 with roof and floor included) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Time Disorientation:** Within 14 hours, he was already off by 2 hours in his time estimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Meals were sent randomly to prevent time guessing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, further contributing to disorientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Sensory Deprivation:** The extreme lack of stimulation made even cold, soggy food taste "awesome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, and a metal plate became as entertaining as an iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Insomnia:** The constant bright lights severely affected his sleep pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. A doctor noted this was because he "doesn't need to sleep" but "wants to sleep this off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Agitation and Paranoia:** By day two, he exhibited signs of agitation from boredom and paranoia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. He started counting again, reaching 1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

### Mid-Challenge (Day 3-5)
The subject's condition worsened, demonstrating the [[psychological_effects_of_longterm_confinement | psychological effects of longterm confinement]].
*   **Increased Boredom:** He felt "very hard" mentally and described feeling "bored. Help" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   **Imagination as Coping:** By hour 65, he started envisioning scenarios, such as walking in a park, to combat depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Compulsive Counting:** He meticulously counted 447 grains of rice on a tray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Further Disorientation:** He was a full day off in his time estimate by the night of day five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>, and at the halfway point (84 hours), he was mixing up words like "hungry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Physical Symptoms:** He developed a "ginormous headache" from the bright lights and felt constantly hungry due to under-stimulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Emotional Swings:** Meals brought temporary happiness, followed by waves of depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. He experienced a severe fear of missing out (FOMO) and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Regressive Behavior:** He began throwing objects and playing games with trash, demonstrating [[participant_reactions_to_unusual_tasks | participant reactions to unusual tasks]] and a "natural human urge for freedom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. He felt like an "animal" and believed he had "lost all my rights as a human" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

### Breaking Point (Day 6-7)
The final stages revealed extreme [[psychological_effects_of_isolation | psychological effects of isolation]] and a decline in [[psychological_resilience_in_prolonged_contests | psychological resilience in prolonged contests]].
*   **Dreams and Disorientation:** His dreams began to incorporate the room, leading to confusion upon waking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. He desperately wished to know the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.
*   **Paranoia about Surveillance:** He counted numerous cameras, feeling constantly watched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Physical Coping:** He resorted to walking 1,000 laps around the room to maintain sanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
*   **Mental Deterioration:** His mind was "slowly deforming into stupidity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
*   **Emotional Collapse:** He described himself as being at "literal rock bottom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>, feeling "dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>, "depressed and lonely," and "miserable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. He cried, begging to be let out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. He was observed napping on the floor, throwing things, having tantrums, and being happy about snacks, likening him to a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.
*   **Misjudgment of Time:** Despite his estimations, he was still 24 hours away from completion when he thought it was his "last meal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. He refused to believe he had another 24 hours left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.

## Conclusion

The subject completed the seven-day [[stunt_experiments_and_pranks | stunt experiment]]. Upon release, he felt lightheaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a> and found it difficult to interact with humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. He expressed relief at escaping the bright lights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a> and seeing the outside world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. Reflecting on [[the_psychology_of_overcoming_extreme_challenges | the psychology of overcoming extreme challenges]], he admitted that if he had known how difficult it would be, he "never would have done this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. He concluded that he gained no mental clarity or self-knowledge, only the ability to throw things out a conveyor belt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

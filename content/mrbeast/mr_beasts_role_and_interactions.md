In a specific [[mrbeast_challenges | MrBeast challenge]] involving 100 kids competing against 100 adults in two massive cubes, MrBeast serves as the primary host, creator, and instigator of events, often interacting directly with participants and his crew to influence the game's outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Challenge Setup and Rules

MrBeast establishes the core premise of the [[mr_beast_challenge_setup_and_rules | challenge]]: the cube with the most people inside after 100 hours splits half a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. He clarifies that only the remaining players on the winning team will split the prize money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Direct Interactions and Motivations

MrBeast frequently interacts with the contestants to test their resolve and reduce their numbers.

### Early Temptations
An hour into the challenge, MrBeast offers $1,000 to anyone who decides to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. He explicitly states that this is the only time money will be received unless they win the main prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This initial offer successfully eliminates 12 adults and 10 kids within the first hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Food-Based Offers
MrBeast uses undesirable food, specifically oatmeal, to encourage participants to leave, noting that it "always works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. He then leverages hunger by offering preferred food items in exchange for contestants leaving or for shrinking their zone:
*   He offers Taco Bell to the kids if two of them exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   He offers coffee to the adults under the same condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   Later, he proposes to shrink the kids' cube if they agree to receive pizza for dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, leading to a [[mr_beast_and_friends_pizza_challenge | pizza reward]] for the adults who accepted a similar offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Dynamic Rule Changes and Pranks
MrBeast introduces dynamic elements to the [[mrbeast_challenges | challenge]] to maintain tension and encourage exits:
*   He introduces giant buttons outside each cube, which, when pressed first after turning green, shrink the opposing team's zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. He leaves the timing of the button change to his crew member, Karl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   He oversees pranks to tempt contestants to leave, such as using an empty briefcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, initially without money, then with $1 sticking out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   MrBeast, along with his team, attempts to induce penalties by dropping balloons into the cubes, with notes stating that popping them will result in a shrunken cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## Behind the Scenes and Promotions

MrBeast is seen coordinating with his team, such as Chris bringing in a porta-potty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, and Nolan making various offers and observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. He also uses the video to promote his sponsors, such as Nerf, by showcasing a Nerf Gel Fire Blaster and introducing his own branded Mr. Beast Nerf Blaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. He also promotes his Feastables chocolate bars towards the end of the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

## Conclusion and Prize Distribution

At the end of the 100 hours, MrBeast announces the adults as the winners by a landslide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. As a reward for staying the entire time, he gives each adult $1,000 as a thank you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>, fulfilling the promise of his [[mrbeasts_unique_video_concepts | unique video concept]].

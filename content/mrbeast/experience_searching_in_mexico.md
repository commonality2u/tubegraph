The challenge of finding a specific individual anywhere in the world for a $10,000 prize led to an extensive search in Mexico. The target was described as an old man wearing a Hawaiian shirt, shorts, and specific shoes, with a 48-hour deadline to find him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Initial Strategy and Search in Cabo
Given the description, the decision was made to travel to Cabo, Mexico, as the target resembled a "beach type guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This search became part of [[exploring_international_destinations | exploring international destinations]]. Upon arrival in Mexico, the first step taken was to rent a boat to aid in the search for "Mr. Emoji guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Obstacles and Adaptations
Despite encountering numerous older men, none initially matched the precise criteria, often lacking a Hawaiian shirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Many individuals were "almost there" but lacked one specific feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. After considerable searching, a perfect match was located, but he declined to participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

A new strategy involved purchasing ten Hawaiian shirts to leave out, hoping people would start wearing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. With only two hours remaining, the possibility of success seemed unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, leading to a feeling of defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Success
However, with only an hour left, the target individual was unexpectedly found sitting in the lobby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The man, dubbed "Mr. Hey Hi," was informed he had won $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

In a high-stakes challenge, participants employ various [[challenges_and_hiding_strategies | challenges and hiding strategies]] and techniques to evade a professional bounty hunter attempting to retrieve a $100,000 backpack. The primary goal is to remain uncaught until midnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Vehicle Changes and Diversions

A key [[strategic_disguises_and_getaways | strategic disguise and getaway]] tactic involves frequently changing vehicles to throw off pursuit.
*   **Initial Car Swap** The participant immediately drives to a car dealership to purchase a new car after the initial escape, knowing the bounty hunter has identified the first vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The intention is to abandon the newly purchased car (a Kia Soul) once it is identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Concealed Vehicles** Cars are strategically hidden in advance for quick getaways at various locations, such as a Mustang hidden behind a bush in a field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a> and an ATV for off-road travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Purchasing Vehicles on the Fly** A new car is purchased from a waiting individual at a dock to continue the escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

## Elaborate Hiding Spots and Structures

Sophisticated hiding spots and custom structures are used to evade capture.
*   **Bank Vault in a Warehouse** A bank-grade vault is installed in a remote warehouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This vault is believed to be one of the most secure in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
    *   A secret tunnel beneath the vault allows for a covert escape from the warehouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
    *   A pre-recorded message is played from a computer inside the vault to mislead pursuers into thinking the participant is still inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Rented Movie Theater** An entire movie theater is rented out to control the environment and prevent others from entering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
    *   A "secret door" is used to seal off a section of the theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
    *   The participant hides *below* a room that was just checked, leveraging the pursuers' assumption that they would be on the roof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
    *   Security cameras within the theater are accessed via a phone to monitor the bounty hunter's movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
    *   A pre-disconnected fire alarm is activated as a diversion for escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Rented Mansion** A mansion is rented, equipped with security cameras to monitor the bounty hunter's arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, facilitating a quick escape by boat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **Abandoned Hospital** The participant plans to hide among "hundreds of mannequins" in an abandoned hospital, a technique akin to [[hide_and_seek_strategies | hide and seek strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
*   **Rented Hotel** A contingency plan involved renting every room in a hotel to create numerous hiding possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

## Obstacle Creation and Diversions

The participant actively engages in [[obstacle_creation_and_evasion | obstacle creation and evasion]] to slow down or misdirect the pursuers.
*   **Barriers in Fields** A horizontal bar is used to block vehicle access in a field, forcing the bounty hunter to proceed on foot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Porta-Potty Helicopter Diversion** Multiple porta-potties are set up in a field, with one being lifted by a helicopter as a major visual diversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. The participant makes a phone call to suggest being inside the lifted porta-potty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, while actually escaping in a hidden car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

## Strategic Movement and Planning

*   **Pre-positioned Resources** Getaway vehicles and hiding spots are pre-planned and set up hours or even the night before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **GPS Tracker Counter-measures** While the bounty hunter relies on a phone tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, the participant anticipates this and employs tactics like ditching the tracked car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a> or creating large-scale diversions that don't move the actual tracker, such as the porta-potty helicopter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **Exploiting Terrain** Using train tracks to force pursuers to ditch their ATV is an example of leveraging the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **Sacrifice Play** In a desperate move, the participant attempts to sacrifice a companion to physically impede the bounty hunter's final approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

## Bounty Hunter's Counter-tactics

The bounty hunter and their team also demonstrate their own tactics:
*   **GPS Tracking** The primary tool for pursuit is a GPS tracker placed on the participant's phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Information Gathering** Interrogating people, like the car dealership employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, to gain information on the participant's movements or vehicles.
*   **Anticipation and Logic** The bounty hunter attempts to anticipate the participant's next moves, for example, assuming they would be on the roof of the movie theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Aggressive Pursuit** This includes ramming the participant's car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a> and jumping off a bridge to intercept a boat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, demonstrating a high level of dedication typical of a [[military_evasion_challenge | military evasion challenge]] or similar intense pursuit.
*   **Team Coordination** The bounty hunter coordinates multiple team members in cars and on foot to cover ground and block escape routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

Despite the elaborate tactics, the participant is ultimately caught due to a bear hug from a friend, preventing escape with the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

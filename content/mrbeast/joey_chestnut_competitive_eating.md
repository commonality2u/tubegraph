His strategy involved cutting and folding the pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, and he utilized water to aid in swallowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. He maintained an intense focus, described as being "like a great white shark" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, ignoring attempts to distract or bribe him with $10,000 to stop for five minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

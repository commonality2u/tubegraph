Luxury yachts vary significantly in size, cost, and the amenities they offer, from a sinking $1 boat to a city-sized super yacht. The escalating price points introduce increasingly elaborate and lavish features.

## The $1 Yacht <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
The $1 yacht was acquired because its owner faced $18,000 per year in storage costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Upon boarding, it became clear why it was sold so cheaply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Its floor was unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, and it immediately began sinking after being put in the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## The $1 Million Yacht <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>

The $100,000 prize challenge orchestrated by popular YouTuber MrBeast (Jimmy Donaldson) took place in the mysterious and eerie setting of an [[abandoned_hospital_exploration | abandoned hospital]]. This thrilling event unfolded with a variety of twists and turns as participants competed for a grand prize of $100,000. Here's a detailed breakdown of the challenge and its exciting moments.

## Setting the Scene

The challenge started in an abandoned hospital complex boasting over 100 rooms spread across six distinct buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This elaborate setup provided a perfect playground for the [[hide_and_seek_in_unique_locations | hide-and-seek inspired competition]] with an enticing prize at stake â€” $100,000 in cash.

## Rules of the Game

Participants were given a countdown to hide anywhere within the vicinity of the hospital, setting the stage for a high-stakes game of tag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The primary objective was straightforward: avoid being tagged by MrBeast and his hunting crew, with the last person tagged crowned the winner.

## The Hunt Begins

As soon as the countdown concluded, chaos ensued, with participants scrambling to find hiding spots. The vast and labyrinthine structure of the hospital presented unique challenges for both the hiders and seekers. The first capture happened quickly as Sam became the first contestant to be tagged and sent to "jail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Chasing and Capture

The thrilling chase sequences were a highlight of the event, with participants using various strategies, from [[building_a_shelter_with_limited_resources | climbing rooftops]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> to [[creative_survival_challenges | hiding under trailers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Each capture was met with a buzzer sound, adding to the tension as the field of competitors dwindled.

## Strategic Alliances and Betrayals

Throughout the challenge, participants formed temporary alliances and engaged in [[teamwork_and_betrayal_in_games | strategic maneuvers]] to outsmart the seekers. A memorable moment involved Sapnap bribing MrBeast with information about Karl's location in exchange for a tweet promoting his channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This strategy paid off when Karl was discovered beneath stacks of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Narrowing the Field

As the game progressed, the area was restricted to intensify the competition. Participants were informed of a $10,000 cash prize placed in the middle of the hospital, a temptation that came with the risk of being spotted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

## The Final Moments and Victory

With only two contestants remaining, Sapnap and Jordan, the chase entered its final phase. Despite the pressures and near captures, Sapnap managed to evade the seekers long enough to emerge as the victor. MrBeast confirmed Sapnap's win by announcing that Jordan had been found first, securing Sapnap's win of $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.

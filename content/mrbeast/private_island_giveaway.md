To celebrate reaching 100 million subscribers, MrBeast purchased a [[private_jet_giveaway_challenge | private island]] and gave it away to one lucky subscriber through a series of extreme challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. One hundred subscribers were brought to compete in four challenges, with the last person standing winning the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Competition Structure

The competition began with 100 subscribers and progressed through multiple elimination rounds until a single winner remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

### Challenge 1: Fire Starting

The first challenge required contestants to start a fire and light their torch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The first 50 people to succeed moved on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. While MrBeast estimated it would take an average of 20 minutes, some contestants managed to light their torches much faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. After this round, 50 contestants were eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Challenge 2: Red Light, Green Light

The second challenge was a recreation of "Red Light, Green Light" from *Squid Game*, taking place in the middle of the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Unlike the previous version, there was no time limit, with MrBeast deliberately trying to trick contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Only the first 20 to step on or cross the red line would move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

> "Every word that leaves this mouth I gotta think it through." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>

One contestant managed to complete the challenge through a technicality by listening carefully to MrBeast's words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Those eliminated were given $3,000 as a thank you for participating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Challenge 3: Subscriber Elimination

With 20 contestants remaining and only 10 seats on a raft heading to a pirate ship for the next challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, the earliest subscriber was given the power to eliminate half the remaining people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. This power was granted as a competitive edge for the 100 million subscriber special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This reduced the contestant pool to the final 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Challenge 4: Plank Drop

On a pirate ship, 10 contestants faced 10 planks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. Five planks would drop the contestant into the water, while five would remain stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. The first five contestants to choose a safe plank would move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Surprisingly, the first four chosen planks were all safe, defying statistical odds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. This meant only one safe plank remained for the last six contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Ultimately, five contestants were eliminated, leaving a final five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

### Monetary Temptation

Before the final challenge on the island, MrBeast offered each of the final five contestants a check for $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. They had the choice to take the money and leave, or burn the check and continue competing for the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. All five contestants chose to burn their checks, demonstrating their determination to win the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

### Final Challenge: Treasure Hunt

The ultimate challenge involved a hide-and-seek game for the deed to the island, which was taped to the back of MrBeast's 100 million subscriber play button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. The contestants were blindfolded while MrBeast hid the play button nearby, but after driving far away to mislead them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. The first person to find the play button would win the [[private_jet_giveaway_challenge | private island]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

One contestant, who had been close to being eliminated multiple times throughout the competition, ultimately found the play button and won the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

## The Island

The [[private_jet_giveaway_challenge | private island]] itself boasts several [[luxury_amenities_on_expensive_islands | luxury amenities]] including a beautiful beach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, complimentary golf carts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, a cabana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, a helicopter pad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>, and a swimming pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Its size was noted as being four times larger than another [[private_jet_giveaway_challenge | private island]] previously won by Chandler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. The winner received the official deed to the island, which was inside the 100 million subscriber play button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

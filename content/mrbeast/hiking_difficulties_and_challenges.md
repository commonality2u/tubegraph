Hiking, especially up one of America's tallest mountains to over 6,000 feet in the air, presents numerous [[highstakes_physical_challenges | physical]] and [[psychological_and_physical_challenges | psychological challenges]] before a 24-hour [[camping_on_a_mountain | camping]] challenge can even begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Participants faced a range of [[challenges_and_survival_strategies | difficulties]] from the ascent to managing resources at high altitudes.

## Initial Ascent and Terrain
The journey began on the Grandfather Trail, which involved extensive climbing over rocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Early on, the path became "pretty scary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> with participants admitting to being afraid of heights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The terrain was challenging, featuring deep drops and difficult climbing sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Some hikers struggled with balance, stating, "I have a bad equilibrium, so climbing things is hard for me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Physical and Mental Strain
The hike quickly led to physical exhaustion. After what felt like three hours, one participant "can't feel my legs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, while another noted the unexpected amount of rocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The mental toll was also evident, with fears of falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a> and even death expressed during particularly perilous sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. The continuous climb and numerous ladders, some with fatal fall risks, added to the distress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The thin air at 6,000 feet required participants to take deep breaths to avoid lightheadedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

## Navigational Challenges
The group faced issues with navigation, at one point realizing they were going the "wrong way" down a deep drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. They also had to descend one mountain only to ascend another, making for a literal "four-hour hike" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Additionally, a member was temporarily forgotten after stopping to pee, highlighting the potential for separation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

## Resource Management and [[survival_challenges | Survival Challenges]]
Upon reaching the peak, a significant [[survival_challenges | challenge]] emerged: water scarcity. A "big oopsie" led to drinking too much water during the ascent, leaving the group short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. A "special ops team" was dispatched on a mile-long round trip to a spring to collect water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. The need to boil the water for consumption was understood, although attempts at setting up a grill without an experienced "Boy Scout" were comically unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Food was also limited, consisting only of SpaghettiOs, granola bars, beef jerky, and a Snickers bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

## Unexpected Events and Outcomes
Adding to the [[challenges_of_extreme_survival_scenarios | unique sporting challenges]], the group inexplicably ordered a pizza to the mountain peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. A dedicated delivery person spent six hours hiking to deliver it, describing it as "a quest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. Despite the humorous interlude, the real [[strategies_in_endurance_challenges | challenge]] was the impending darkness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. With no flashlights and a long hike back, the group needed to move quickly to avoid being stranded in the dark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. The night brought concerns about cold temperatures (potentially 45 degrees Fahrenheit) and bear attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

The experience ultimately served as a reminder of the importance of [[responsible_hiking_practices | responsible hiking practices]], such as staying on trails, following regulations, and respecting natural resources and wildlife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

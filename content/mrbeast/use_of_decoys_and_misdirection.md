In the adrenaline-fueled chase organized by MrBeast, [[strategies_for_evading_capture_through_disguises_and_decoys | decoys and misdirection]] played a central role in evading an elite military squad determined to capture him. These tactics were expertly employed to create confusion and gain advantages, reflecting strategic ingenuity.

## The Role of Decoys

Decoys were used to mislead the pursuers and buy time. One significant instance involved burying Nolan alive to masquerade as MrBeast. The substitution was designed to misdirect the military team into believing that they had almost cornered MrBeast, when in fact, they were far from capturing him.

## Tactical Misdirection

Misdirection during the chase was employed not just through physical decoys but also strategic maneuvers:

### 1. Tracker Manipulation
MrBeast used a special bag to jam the signal of the GPS tracker revealing his location to the military team. This created false signals, temporarily confusing his pursuers and allowing him to move undetected.

### 2. Strategic Retreats
At one point, [[using_creative_methods_to_complete_a_task | explosive tactics]] were used to destroy a bridge, forcing the pursuing team to take a longer route and allowing MrBeast a significant head start. This physical barrier acted as another form of strategic misdirection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### 3. Psychological Tactics
MrBeast also engaged in psychological tactics, such as making false claims about his location or condition:

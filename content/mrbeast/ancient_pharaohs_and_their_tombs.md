The ancient [[ancient_egyptian_history_and_architecture | Great Pyramids of Egypt]], including the Pyramid of Khufu, the Pyramid of Khafre, and the Pyramid of Menkaure, were primarily built as tombs for their kings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. These structures were designed to protect the pharaohs' mummies and treasures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

## King Khufu and the Great Pyramid

The Great Pyramid, dating back approximately 4,500 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, is believed to have been ordered by King Khufu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### King's Chamber

The passageway within the pyramid leads to what Egyptologists identify as King Khufu's tomb, known as the Grand Gallery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This room is considered the king's final resting spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, where his mummified body may have been placed 4,600 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Despite this, there is a belief that an as-yet undiscovered chamber within the pyramid might still contain Khufu's body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Decoy Chambers and Lowest Point

The Great Pyramid features decoy chambers, created with significant effort to mislead potential tomb raiders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. One such massive, empty chamber was found at the deepest point of the pyramid, over 300 feet below ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

### Graffiti of the Builders

At the highest point inside the Great Pyramid, where fewer than 50 people in modern history have been <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>, graffiti provides crucial evidence regarding its builders. The names of "gangs" or "teams" are written, such as "Heber" (meaning "team") and "Simsu" (meaning "friends") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. Notably, a cartouche containing Khufu's name is present, indicating "the group friends/gang of Khofu" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. This graffiti, dating back 4,600 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>, supports the theory that [[ancient_egyptian_history_and_architecture | ancient Egyptians]] were the builders, disproving [[myths_and_theories_about_the_pyramids | alternative theories]] such as alien involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.

## King Khafre and His Pyramid

The Pyramid of Khafre is significant for preserving original casing material, showcasing how all pyramids once appeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Explorers ventured nearly 100 feet below the Earth's surface into this pyramid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Burial Chambers of Khafre

What was long believed to be King Khafre's burial chamber was later used for storing restoration tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. The "real resting place" for King Khafre was eventually found and explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This final burial chamber is thought to have once held King Khafre's body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. The chamber also contains graffiti by its alleged discoverer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. It is associated with a "curse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## King Menkaure and His Pyramid

The Pyramid of Menkaure still features some of its original granite casing from 4,600 years ago at its base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

### Decorative Carvings and Chambers

The initial descent into Menkaure's pyramid leads down a shaft over a hundred feet below ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a> to the first chamber in [[ancient_egyptian_history_and_architecture | ancient Egyptian history]] to have decorative carvings, specifically false doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. These decorations are 4,600 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Further into the pyramid, another shaft leads to Menkaure's antechamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. The final descending shaft leads to the burial chamber, which features a vaulted ceiling designed to relieve weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

### Queens' Pyramids

Adjacent to Menkaure's pyramid are three smaller pyramids, built as tombs for his queens or wives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

## Other Significant Tombs and Discoveries

### Tomb of Iymery

The tomb of Iymery, a high priest of the time, is an area that is generally illegal to enter due to the fragility of its ancient artwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. The tomb features vibrant, preserved colors and drawings that are 4,600 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. These drawings are considered more important than the pyramids themselves for understanding the daily life of [[ancient_egyptian_history_and_architecture | ancient Egyptians]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. For example, they illustrate the process of making wine, from stomping grapes to bottling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Other carvings depict normal ancient Egyptians offering items like brandy and beer to Iymery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.

### Workman's Tomb

The Workman's Tomb is the burial site of the people who built the pyramids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. These tombs are simpler, lacking the elaborate paintings found in richer tombs, reflecting the workers' poorer status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Skeletons found in these tombs, dating back 4,600 years, show evidence of spinal stress on both men and women, consistent with moving two-ton blocks, thereby confirming their role in pyramid construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

### Tomb of Osiris

The tomb of the god Osiris is located deep underground and has been visited by very few humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. The descent into this tomb involves navigating tall ladders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Inside, an [[egyptian_burial_sites_and_practices | ancient human skull]] (3,000 years old) was discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. The air within the tomb is thin, posing a risk of passing out due to lack of oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. At the center of the room is the sarcophagus of God Osiris, which is allegedly a portal to the underworld <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

### The Sphinx

The Sphinx is a massive sculpture, half-human and half-lion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. While online [[myths_and_theories_about_the_pyramids | conspiracy theories]] suggest a buried temple filled with gold beneath the Sphinx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>, exploration inside revealed an empty hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, confirming there is no ancient gold there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.# Ancient Pharaohs and Their Tombs

The ancient [[ancient_egyptian_history_and_architecture | Great Pyramids of Egypt]], including the Pyramid of Khufu, the Pyramid of Khafre, and the Pyramid of Menkaure, were primarily built as tombs for their kings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. These structures were designed to protect the pharaohs' mummies and treasures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

## King Khufu and the Great Pyramid

The Great Pyramid, dating back approximately 4,500 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, is believed to have been ordered by King Khufu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Graffiti of the Builders

At the highest point inside the Great Pyramid, where fewer than 50 people in modern history have been <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>, graffiti provides crucial evidence regarding its builders. The names of "gangs" or "teams" are written, such as "Heber" (meaning "team") and "Simsu" (meaning "friends") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. Notably, a cartouche containing Khufu's name is present, indicating "the group friends/gang of Khofu" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. This graffiti, dating back 4,600 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>, supports the theory that [[ancient_egyptian_history_and_architecture | ancient Egyptians]] were the builders, disproving [[myths_and_theories_about_the_pyramids | alternative theories]] such as alien involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.

## King Khafre and His Pyramid

The Pyramid of Khafre is significant for preserving original casing material, showcasing how all pyramids once appeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

It is associated with a "curse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## King Menkaure and His Pyramid

The Pyramid of Menkaure still features some of its original granite casing from 4,600 years ago at its base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

### Decorative Carvings and Chambers

The initial descent into Menkaure's pyramid leads down a shaft over a hundred feet below ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a> to the first chamber in [[ancient_egyptian_history_and_architecture | ancient Egyptian history]] to have decorative carvings, specifically false doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

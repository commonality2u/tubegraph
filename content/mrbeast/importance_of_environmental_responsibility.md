During their 24-hour stay on a deserted island, the participants demonstrated an understanding of [[environmental_impact_considerations_in_large_events | environmental impact considerations]] and [[responsible_hiking_practices | responsible practices]] for natural environments.

## Preventing Pollution and Litter
Before departing the island, the group emphasized the importance of leaving no trace. They made sure to collect all items they had brought with them to avoid polluting the natural habitat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. This act was explicitly stated as crucial because "you don't wanna leave a mess, that's horrible for the environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

## Waste Management on the Island
Even in a remote setting, personal waste management was considered. One participant brought a specific container for human waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, while another mentioned needing to urinate "over there" away from the main camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. These actions reflect an awareness of personal impact on the immediate surroundings, aligning with principles of [[dealing_with_wildlife_and_the_environment | dealing with wildlife and the environment]] by minimizing disruption to the natural ecosystem.

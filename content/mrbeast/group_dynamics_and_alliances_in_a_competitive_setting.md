A unique competition for $250,000 gathers 100 individuals ranging from ages one to 100, where the participants themselves ultimately decide the winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The challenge emphasizes [[teamwork_and_alliances_in_competitions | making friendships]] and convincing others to like you, contrasting with previous "last to leave" formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This setup led to intense [[interpersonal_dynamics_and_reactions_during_contests | interactions]] and shifting [[social_dynamics_in_group_challenges | group dynamics]] throughout the competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Initial Eliminations and First Group Challenge

Initially, contestants were eliminated for leaving their assigned cubes or touching a red line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The youngest and some older participants were the first to be eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Within the first hour, six people were eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

The first major group challenge required 10 people to voluntarily leave their cubes within 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Failure to do so would result in a random elimination of 25 contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Contestants debated who should leave, with suggestions targeting those "past retirement age" or "not above the age of 12" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Despite appeals for "the greater good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, only one person (Age 89) voluntarily left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. As a result, 25 contestants were randomly eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This reduction left 67 participants remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Captains and Betrayal

By Day Two, only 55 contestants remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. A new challenge began with an attempt for all contestants to unanimously agree on a winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This failed quickly, leading to a challenge where each row selected a captain to represent them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

The captains were then offered increasing sums of money to step out of their cube, which would result in the elimination of their entire row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. While most captains initially held strong, Age 30 eventually accepted an offer of $100,000, eliminating his entire row of 20s and 30s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This act of [[friendship_and_competition_dynamics | betrayal]] shocked the other contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a> and underscored the cutthroat nature of the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## The 40s Alliance and Strategic Eliminations

Following the betrayal, the remaining contestants were again unable to agree on a winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. In response to the previous betrayals, the 40s age group formed an alliance to prevent any of their members from being eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

A new challenge involved a spinning wheel that landed on a contestant's age, and the current "controller" (determined by the previous spin) decided whether that person was eliminated or stayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. If the person stayed, they gained control of the wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. The 40s alliance, specifically Age 42 and 43, used this mechanism to eliminate non-alliance members strategically, aiming to "keep control" and prevent being eliminated themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. This strategy led to the elimination of many outside their group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

The "40s alliance" remained strong, despite eliminating popular contestants like Age 11 (Gio) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a> and Age 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>, with the intention of securing their position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. This approach garnered resentment from other groups, particularly the 50s, who felt "decimated" by the 40s' actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. The lesson learned was "trust no one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.

## The "$250,000 Blackout" Challenge

With 20 contestants remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>, another opportunity arose for a single winner: if *only one* person voluntarily stepped out of their blacked-out cube, they would immediately win $250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. However, if more than one person stepped out, all would be eliminated and win nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.

Age 42, a member of the 40s alliance, loudly declared his intention to step out, attempting to deter others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. For much of the challenge, he appeared to be the only one to step out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. However, in the final two seconds, another contestant (Age 56) also stepped out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. This resulted in both Age 42 and Age 56 being eliminated, losing out on the prize money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. The [[team_dynamics_and_strategies | strategic behavior]] and lack of perfect coordination among participants highlighted the individualistic tension within the [[competition_dynamics_and_teamwork | group challenge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>.

## "Deal or No Deal" and Tests of Trust

The next challenge, inspired by "Deal or No Deal," involved briefcases marked "eliminated" or "safe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. Contestants had to decide whether to trust what another contestant claimed was in their briefcase or to choose a random one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.

Examples of trust and deception emerged:
*   Age 14 truthfully revealed his case was "safe," leading Age 41 to steal it and remain in the game, but making everyone else's odds worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. Age 14's honesty ultimately led to his own elimination when he revealed his next case was "eliminated," and Age 43 chose not to steal it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.
*   Age 48 lied, claiming his "safe" case was "eliminated." Age 51 believed him and chose not to steal, resulting in Age 51's elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.
*   Age 96, the oldest contestant, also lied, claiming his "safe" case was "eliminated," successfully staying in the game when Age 67 chose not to steal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.

Selfless acts also occurred, with Age 54 choosing to believe another contestant's claim of an "eliminated" case and "jumping on a grenade" to save them by stealing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>. This challenge significantly reduced the number of contestants to nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>.

## Final Eliminations: Stories and Shifting Alliances

The final nine contestants were tasked with collectively choosing four people to eliminate after hearing each other's personal stories and reasons for needing the prize money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>. This proved to be emotionally challenging, as contestants struggled to rank one person's needs above another's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>.

The voting process revealed the unraveling of the 40s alliance, as votes for elimination were cast against 40-year-olds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>. Age 46, a 40-year-old, was eliminated, leading to the "implosion" of the alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>. Age 96 was also eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>. In the final vote, Age 72 was eliminated after receiving the majority of votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>.

## The Ultimate Test: Collective Consensus

The remaining five contestants entered a large, communal cube for the final challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>. They had one hour to unanimously decide on a single winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:29">[00:35:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>. If more than one person remained in the cube when the timer hit zero, the $250,000 prize money would be destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>.

The group discussed the difficulty of determining who "deserved" the money, acknowledging everyone's struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>. They proposed a "ranked choice voting" system where each person would secretly rank who they believed deserved the money most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>. The person consistently ranked highest would win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:56">[00:37:56]</a>.

After tallying the votes, Age 56 was in fifth place, and Ages 41 and 64 tied for third <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>. The final decision came down to Age 47 and Age 48, who had maintained the strongest [[teamwork_and_alliances_during_competitive_events | alliance]] throughout the entire video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. Age 47 was declared the winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>.

Age 47's victory was attributed to her struggle to eliminate others, her success in building the strongest [[team_dynamics_and_friendships | alliance]], and her consistent fight for those around her, exemplifying the value of [[team_dynamics_and_alliances_in_competitions | alliances]] and compassion in a competitive setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>. The four runners-up each received $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a>.

From: [[mrbeast]] <br/> 

A participant named Josh takes on a [[challenge to win money | challenge to win money]] to earn $10,000 for each day he survives in an isolated room, with the potential to become a millionaire if he lasts 100 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The room initially contains various items, and the only way to end the [[challenge to survive in a circle for cash prize | challenge to survive in a circle for cash prize]] is to press a red button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Challenge Mechanics
*   **Daily Earnings**: Josh earns $10,000 for each day he survives in the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.
*   **Item Removal**: After 24 hours, the host, Jim, delivers the $10,000, but Josh must hand over one item from the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This means the number of items in the room decreases daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Josh's Experience

Initially, Josh believes the [[survival_challenges | challenge]] will be "very easy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. However, Jim hints at the increasing difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Strategic Item Choices
The requirement to give up an item daily introduces a strategic element to the [[challenges of extreme survival scenarios | challenges of extreme survival scenarios]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Josh must decide between items for entertainment, comfort, or sentimental value. His first item given away is an ice cream machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. He later considers sacrificing a family portrait versus a guitar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. He strategically gives up a whiteboard, noting he can write on the walls instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Comforts and Companionship
*   **Private Chef**: Josh is provided with a private chef who can cook anything he desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Visitors**: Jim's friends and crew members, including Carl, Chris, Chandler, and Nolan, occasionally visit Josh. Carl notably influences Josh to give away a picture of him with his sister for an extra $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Nolan stays with Josh for 24 hours, earning Josh an additional $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Girlfriend Visit**: After 12 days, Josh is given the choice between receiving $10,000 or $5,000 delivered by his girlfriend, Kenna. He chooses the latter to see her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Their visit is limited to 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Mental and Physical Toll
As the challenge progresses, Josh shows signs of mental strain:
*   He states he's lost all concept of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   He feels sick and mentions his throat is messed up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   He finds it difficult to remain, especially with $190,000 accumulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   He admits he's "just existing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   He describes the feeling of the challenge as something you "truly won't understand until you--" experience it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   He feels like he's living in a "construction zone" after the hot tub removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   He experiences loneliness and misses everything outside the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

### Key Events
*   **Hidden Check**: On day 8, a $100,000 check is secretly hidden inside the guitar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Josh later discovers it after smashing the guitar on day 34 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   **Proposal Plan**: On day 13, Josh bets Chandler $10,000 that he'll last longer than 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. He then gives Chris and Chandler $20,000 to buy an engagement ring for Kenna, his girlfriend, planning to propose at the end of the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. He expresses that being trapped has made him realize the value of time and he's "done waiting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Jake Paul Cameo**: On day 15, Jim FaceTimes Josh with special guest Jake Paul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Room Destruction**: During the removal of the hot tub, Chris attempts to use a forklift, causing significant damage to the room's floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

## Conclusion

Josh ends the challenge on day 34 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, having accumulated $340,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. With only his bed left as an item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>, he decides to leave, prompted by his desire to propose to Kenna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. He proposes to Kenna outside the room, and she accepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. His family is also present for his exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

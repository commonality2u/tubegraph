The Glass Cube Challenge is an endurance competition where 100 participants, ranging from age one to 100, are enclosed in individual glass cubes. The last person to voluntarily leave their cube wins half a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The setup includes over 300 cameras to monitor every move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> and portable toilets provided when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This [[highstakes_physical_challenges | high-stakes physical challenge]] tests not only [[physical_feats_with_financial_rewards | physical endurance]] but also [[mental_and_physical_strain_in_extreme_conditions | mental fortitude]] and [[the_psychology_of_overcoming_extreme_challenges | psychological resilience]].

## Initial Stages and Motivations

From the outset, participants revealed diverse [[incentives_and_motivations_in_challenges | incentives and motivations in challenges]]. Some expressed a desire to win for personal reasons, like a participant representing age 31 with "the best motivation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, or another wanting to win for his daughter's third birthday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Others had specific financial goals, such as paying off a sister's student debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a> or hoping to pay off a house and retire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. The oldest participants also demonstrated significant resolve, with a 69-year-old declaring they had "winning on my mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> and a 70-year-old aiming to show their grandchild how strong they were <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### Early Departures and Psychological Challenges

Despite strong initial motivations, boredom and discomfort led to early exits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Some participants, including children, left due to noise [[strategies_in_endurance_challenges | strategies]] employed by younger contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. By a few hours into the challenge, 10 people had already left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Day two saw 76 people remaining, with even the 100-year-old veteran choosing to quit, leaving an unforgettable memory for their family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Competition Dynamics and Challenges

To combat boredom and accelerate eliminations, optional [[competition_dynamics_in_endurance_challenges | challenges]] were introduced. These challenges significantly influenced the [[strategies_in_endurance_challenges | strategies in endurance challenges]] and [[motivational_strategies_to_endure_challenges | motivational strategies to endure challenges]]:

### Three Cup Monte

On day two, 63 out of 76 remaining participants voted for a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This challenge was a large-scale "three cup monte" where participants had to track a ball under three large cups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Those who failed were eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. The challenge revealed strategic deception, as some participants intentionally gave wrong answers to their neighbors to eliminate competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This led to increased tension and "beefing" between contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. By the end of day two, only 52 people remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

### Voting for Elimination ("The Purge")

Midway through day four, another challenge was introduced where participants voted to eliminate others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. This challenge specifically targeted those who had lied or were deemed ungrateful, demonstrating that "it pays off to be honest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. An alliance of 50-year-olds effectively used their collective voting power to eliminate competitors, particularly those in their 70s, making it through the purge "untouched" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. This phase was described as "heart wrenching" as some beloved contestants, like age 96, were eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

### Jenga Tower Challenge

Despite significant eliminations, participants continued to vote for challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. The next challenge involved individual Jenga towers where participants had to pull blocks without the tower falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. This challenge eliminated everyone above the age of 60, leaving a "wasteland" of empty cubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. It narrowed the field to a final ten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

### Marble Game

Another challenge, reminiscent of the Squid Games marble game, saw contestants playing one-on-one against neighbors, aiming to win all 20 marbles within 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. This challenge saw participants making [[motivational_strategies_to_endure_challenges | high-stakes gambles]], such as a coin flip for $500,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>, or an "all or nothing" rock-paper-scissors match for marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. This continued until only five people remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

### Public Vote for Finalists

With only five contestants left, a unique challenge was presented: the 95 already eliminated participants would vote for who they wanted out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. This challenge highlighted how personal interactions and alliances throughout the competition influenced outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. Two participants successfully advanced to the final round, having survived the "brutal" and "crushing" elimination process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

## The Final Showdown

After over a week in the cubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>, the final two contestants (age 52 and age 40) faced their ultimate test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. As a reward for reaching this stage, one contestant's family, including his daughter, were brought to see him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.

The final challenge was a game of bluff and trust with two briefcases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. One briefcase contained the $500,000 check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. A coin flip determined who would secretly look inside their briefcase, becoming the only person aware of the money's location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. The other contestant then had to decide whether to keep their own briefcase or steal the other's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.

In the end, the contestant who truthfully stated the money was in his briefcase won the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>. The runner-up received $10,000 and a family trip to Disneyland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. The challenge demonstrated that in the long run, honesty can be a winning strategy.

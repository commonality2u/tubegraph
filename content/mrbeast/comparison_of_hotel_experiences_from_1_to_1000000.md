## The $1 Hotel: A Mat in a Hallway

The journey began with the world's cheapest hotel, located in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. For $1 a night, guests can rent a mat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Features
*   **Room**: A single mat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Comfort**: Described as lacking comfort compared to a home mattress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Room Service**: Non-existent due to the price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### Experience
Guests slept in a hallway, with people constantly stepping over them throughout the night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This stay exemplifies the [[challenges_of_staying_in_ultracheap_hotels|challenges of staying in ultra-cheap hotels]].

## The $1,000 a Night Cave

The next step up was a cave hotel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, located 200 feet below ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, offering the entire cave exclusively to the guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### Features
*   **Accommodation**: Two beds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, a living room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, and one bathroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   **Unique Aspects**: The bathroom was transparent, allowing others to see inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Experience
Despite being an improvement from the $1 mat, the cave had stained beds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a> and lacked Wi-Fi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The entrance was noted to look like something out of a horror movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, and there wasn't much to do inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, except discover a keyboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## The $10,000 a Night Underwater Palace

A significant leap in price brought guests to a $10,000 a night villa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, which featured an incredible underwater component.

### Features
*   **Accommodation**: Three bedrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Amenities**: Bathtubs by the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, access to a private dock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, an infinity pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, unlimited food prepared by a private chef <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Highlight**: An underwater villa room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a> with an underwater bathroom for showering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Activities**: Included jet skis and water jet packs for an afternoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

### Experience
The underwater room was described as being "in a fishbowl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a> and was considered worth the price for the incredible fish views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. An [[unique_dining_experience_in_a_hot_air_balloon_for_10000|unique dining experience]] was offered in an underwater restaurant, surrounded by fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. The overall experience was deemed "the greatest hotel in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This aligns with [[unique_features_of_luxury_hotel_accommodations|unique features of luxury hotel accommodations]].

### $50 Bus Features

*   **Condition**: The bus was hot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a> and did not start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, requiring it to be towed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Experience**: Mosquito bites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

### Comparison
The private island offered unparalleled luxury and service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, including a whale sighting on the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

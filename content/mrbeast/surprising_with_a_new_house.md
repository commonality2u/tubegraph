In a elaborate prank, a brand new house was gifted to CJ after his residence was filled with elephant toothpaste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This [[surprising_people_with_free_cars_and_merchandise | unexpected reward]] was a counter-prank initiated after it was discovered CJ was covering Karl's house with sticky notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## The Prank: Elephant Toothpaste
The primary objective was to fill CJ's house with elephant toothpaste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, a chemical reaction that creates a massive amount of foam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### Preparation
*   **Expert Consultation**: Mark Rober, an expert holding two world records with elephant toothpaste, was enlisted to help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Scale of the Prank**: The team prepared 14 drums of elephant toothpaste, using 500 gallons of hydrogen peroxide, nearly doubling the existing world record for elephant toothpaste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Misdirection**: To ensure the surprise, CJ was led to believe he was participating in a separate prank, covering "Brady's house" (which was actually Karl's house) with sticky notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This created a "prank inception" scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### Execution
While CJ was away covering Karl's house with sticky notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, the team unleashed the elephant toothpaste in his house. The foam rapidly expanded, breaking windows and exiting through the chimney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. The prank was designed to be released as CJ pulled into his driveway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Before initiating the prank, important items were removed from the house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

## The Surprise: A New House
After witnessing the devastation of his house, CJ was informed that a brand new house had been purchased for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. CJ expressed disbelief and excitement over his [[winning_a_prize_unexpectedly | new house]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

> "Oh my goodness, I still cannot believe that this is my new house." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>

Despite receiving a new house, a team was also assigned to work "around the clock" to fix his old house, ensuring he was not "screwed over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. This act highlights the significant [[spending_and_generosity_in_unexpected_situations | generosity]] involved in these elaborate pranks.

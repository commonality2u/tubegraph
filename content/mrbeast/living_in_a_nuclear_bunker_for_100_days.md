Two individuals, Hugo and Rayne, who had never met before, attempted to live for 100 days in a newly constructed nuclear bunker, 40 feet underground, to win half a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. If either person left, both would receive nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Bunker Features and Initial Days
The bunker was equipped with everything needed for 100 days of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This included:
*   Beds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>
*   The ability to grow their own vegetables, facilitating [[selfsustaining_agriculture_in_bunkers | self-sustaining agriculture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   A significant amount of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>

Initially, Hugo and Rayne seemed to get along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, adapting to life without sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. They began learning new skills, such as guitar and Spanish, and exercising to combat boredom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## The Twist: Daily Alarm
On day ten, a twist was revealed: two hand scanners with a one-minute timer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. If the timer reached zero, their half-million dollars would be incinerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. To stop it, both had to place their hands on the scanners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This alarm would go off randomly once every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, and failure once meant losing everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This significantly increased their stress levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

### Hidden Surprise
On day 13, Hugo and Rayne discovered a surprise hidden under the floorboards: a "whole other world" with chocolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Challenge Offers and Decisions

### Day 20: Reduced Timer for More Money
To test their teamwork, the host offered an additional $50,000, increasing the prize pool to $550,000, if they agreed to reduce the alarm timer from one minute to 30 seconds for the remaining 80 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Despite the risk, they accepted, confident in their speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, consistently reaching the scanners in under ten seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

### Day 30: Silent Alarm Offer
On day 30, a $50,000 increase (to $600,000) was offered in exchange for turning off the alarm sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. This would require them to take shifts to constantly monitor for the silent alarm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Rayne and Hugo decided to pass on this offer, prioritizing their comfort over the extra money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

### Day 40: Individual Exit Offer
Tensions began to rise between Hugo and Rayne, with Hugo expressing frustration over doing most of the chores, including cooking and gardening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. On day 40, $100,000 was removed from the prize pool and offered to one person if they chose to leave the bunker. The remaining person would stay to compete for the other $450,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Hugo considered leaving due to the chores but ultimately decided to stay with Rayne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

### Guest Appearance: Ryan Trahan
By day 45, the tension between Hugo and Rayne was severe, with them barely speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. To "shake things up," Ryan Trahan, known for [[surviving_50_hours_in_antarctica | living in unusual places]], was introduced to spend 50 hours in the bunker as a contestant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Ryan helped facilitate a "friendship test" between Hugo and Rayne, encouraging them to acknowledge their mutual support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. His presence significantly improved their relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

### Day 50: Further Timer Reduction Offer
On day 50, after Ryan's departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>, an offer was made: for every second they took off the remaining 30-second timer, $5,000 would be added to the prize pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. They agreed to cut ten seconds off the timer, bringing it down to 20 seconds and raising the prize to $600,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

### Day 60: Triple Alarm Offer
Without Ryan, the relationship between Hugo and Rayne began to unravel again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. On day 60, an offer of $50,000 (raising the total to $650,000) was made if they agreed to have the alarm go off three times a day instead of once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. They declined, unwilling to endure the increased discomfort for the remaining 40 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

## Growing Restlessness and Conflict
By day 61, both Hugo and Rayne were experiencing significant restlessness and boredom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. Hugo spent increasing amounts of time in his "vibe cave," a hidden storage space he converted into a private area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. This created more friction, leading to careless mistakes, such as Rayne forgetting to feed the fish and almost missing the alarm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. Hugo expressed regret about not taking the previous exit offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

### Day 70: Separated Individual Exit Offer
On day 70, the host separated Hugo and Rayne and brought back the individual exit offer. This time, $200,000 was removed from the prize pool, and either person could leave with it, while the other would remain to compete for the increased remaining prize of $400,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. Despite Hugo's earlier regrets, neither of them chose to leave, and the $200,000 was returned to the prize pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.

### Day 80: Ten-Day Alarm Pause
By day 80, Hugo and Rayne were struggling significantly with their relationship and the monotony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. The host offered them a ten-day break from the alarm if they correctly answered a question: "Which tastes better: a Feastables chocolate bar or a Hershey's chocolate bar?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. They correctly answered "Feastables" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>, earning them a much-needed reprieve, which helped them mend their friendship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>. They used this time to practice their alarm response times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>.

## The Final Stretch

### Day 90: Cumulative Timer Offer
On day 90, the alarm returned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>. A $100,000 addition (to $700,000) was offered, in exchange for the alarm timer being set to one minute, but this minute would have to last for the *entire* remaining ten days of the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>. They accepted the offer, reorganizing the bunker to minimize their distance from the scanners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>.

The final ten days were intense, with Hugo and Rayne constantly staying near the scanners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>. They narrowly avoided critical mistakes, even managing to respond quickly while asleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>. Rayne imposed strict rules, including a "bathroom line," to ensure Hugo stayed close to the scanners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>. Despite the continued friction, their determination to win for each other grew stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.

## Conclusion: 100 Days Complete
On day 100, after a final button press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>, Hugo and Rayne successfully completed the challenge, emerging from the bunker to see the sun for the first time in 100 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>. They each received $350,000 of the $700,000 prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>.

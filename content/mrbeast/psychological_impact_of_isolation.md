The "100 Days in a Cube" challenge subjected two strangers, Bailey and Suzie, to prolonged isolation within a white cube, revealing various [[psychological effects of isolation | psychological effects of isolation]] and [[the psychological and emotional challenges of isolation | emotional challenges]] over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Participants were offered half a million dollars if they could survive 100 days without one of them leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Initial Adjustments and Challenges
Upon entering the chamber, which one participant likened to an "insane asylum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, the two strangers initially displayed awkwardness, standing on different sides of the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. A significant [[challenges of isolation | challenge]] was the complete lack of external cues for day or time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, leading to disrupted sleep patterns. On the very first night, they slept for only two hours, effectively starting their second day at 2:37 a.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The thought of the outside world continuing without them also caused anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Impact of Confinement on Routine and Mental State

### Boredom and Entertainment
Living in the "pretty boring" white cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, consuming the same food daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, and dealing with constant bright lights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a> quickly led to extreme boredom. To combat this, they resorted to creative, if unusual, activities:
*   **Improvised Games** They made a deck of playing cards from journal paper on day four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Time Tracking** On day five, they devised a sign-in sheet to trick camera operators into helping them track the date and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Erratic Behavior** By day seven, the boredom manifested in bizarre behavior, such as Bailey whipping pork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. By day nine, they were bored enough to intentionally expose the red line that, if crossed, would forfeit their prize money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Lethargy** By day 20, boredom was "at an all-time high," with one participant simply sitting and staring upon waking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### Sensory Deprivation and Sleep
The constant, unchangeable bright lights were a significant source of discomfort, causing physical eye stinging and making it difficult to sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Participants sought refuge in the bathroom where the lights could be turned off, making it a dark sanctuary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### Coping Strategies
As time progressed, participants developed new coping mechanisms and learned to manage their confinement:
*   **Adaptation to Routine** Their routine became very simple: waking up, cooking, and sleeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **Imagination and Nostalgia** Participants often discussed what they missed from the outside world, such as seasoning on food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, and various forms of entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Creative Problem Solving** On day 40, they managed to rig the provided TV with an antenna made from a frayed wire to receive digital channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, providing much-needed entertainment, despite only getting race car races <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
*   **Milestones and Personal Connections** Marking days and celebrating events like a mother's birthday with a handmade gift helped maintain morale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. The opportunity to see family for 20 minutes on day 50, despite the cost, was a significant emotional event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

## Impact on Relationships and Social Dynamics
The close quarters began to strain their relationship. By day 20, Bailey felt like he was "sharing a space with an annoying sibling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Despite initial awkwardness, they became close friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>, but the constant proximity and differing personalities led to new [[impact_of_isolation_on_relationships | relational challenges]]:
*   **Irritation** Suzie was annoyed by Bailey's constant energy and desire to rave at 3 a.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>, while Bailey was frustrated by Suzie's disinterest in board games and her habit of showering during movie choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>. Suzie even hid the Monopoly dice to avoid playing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>.
*   **Dependence and Frustration** Suzie resented Bailey for always taking the hot water for showers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.
*   **Emotional Swings** The experience was described as "the highest of highs" followed by "back to our little cube all alone," indicating significant emotional fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

Despite these growing pains, they ultimately set aside their differences as the challenge neared its end, counting down the days together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. This highlights the complex [[psychological effects of longterm confinement | psychological effects of longterm confinement]], where shared experience can both create bonds and amplify minor irritations. The ultimate decision to split the prize money rather than steal from each other demonstrated the strength of their bond formed through the shared ordeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>.

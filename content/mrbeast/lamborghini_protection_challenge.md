The [[Lamborghini protection challenge | Lamborghini Protection Challenge]] is a multi-phase [[mrbeast_challenges | MrBeast challenge]] where contestant Blake must protect a quarter-million dollar Lamborghini from various destructive forces over several days to win the car and an additional $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Blake previously appeared in two other videos, this being his third and final attempt to win a grand prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Challenge Rules and Prize
The objective of the challenge is to protect the Lamborghini from four distinct destructive phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. For each phase, Blake is given 24 hours to build a defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The grand prize for successfully protecting the car through all phases is the Lamborghini itself, along with an additional $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Phase 1: Bullet Protection
The first phase required Blake to protect the Lamborghini from 10,000 bullets fired by eight soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

### Preparation
Blake had 24 hours to build a defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. His initial strategy involved a wall of cinder blocks, shipping containers filled with refrigerators, and a wall of cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. He spent $78,000 on supplies for this phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Construction
Blake used various materials, including a water truck, junk cars, and CONEX crates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. He built a wall primarily composed of concrete, with the tallest part in the center to block "crow's nest machine guns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. He also stuffed storage containers with a van and a giant tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The Lamborghini was tucked away among these defenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. He worked through the night into the next morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Outcome
Eight men fired 10,000 bullets at Blake's fortress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Despite the cinder blocks crumbling under sustained fire from LMGs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, the Lamborghini survived without a single bullet hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## Phase 2: 100-Foot Drop
The second phase involved the Lamborghini being lifted 100 feet by a crane and then dropped after 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Blake had to catch it without it being destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

### Preparation
Blake's strategy, inspired by a construction worker, was to create a landing zone using CONEX crates in a square formation, filled with soft materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. His crew bought every pillow and air mattress in the city, as his previous supplies were too hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### Construction
Blake worked through the night, despite being sleep-deprived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. He intended to fill the square with air mattresses, pillows, bubble wrap, and bouncy castles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. He even attempted to wrap the car itself in bubble wrap while on the crane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. The final defense included three bouncy castles, 150 mattresses, 150 pillows, and 2,000 cardboard boxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

### Outcome
The Lamborghini was dropped 100 feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Despite the impact, the car started and its lights worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. An appraiser determined the only damage was a small crack in the bumper, which would reduce the car's price by about $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

## Phase 3: Flaming Cars
For the third phase, Blake faced a recreation of the [[lamborghini_destruction | flaming cars challenge]] that previously cost him $500,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This time, twice as many cars (10 flaming cars) were dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

### Preparation
Blake spent the night disassembling his Phase 2 defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. His plan was to cut out the bottom of a shipping container to surround the Lamborghini and then use two more containers to form a "V" shape above it to deflect the cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Crucially, he made sure to remove all flammable materials, specifically wood, from the container, as this was his downfall in the previous challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### Construction
Blake and his crew carefully lowered the cut-out container over the Lamborghini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. They then positioned the two other containers to create the "V" deflector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. He also added dirt and concrete to the defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

### Outcome
Flaming cars were dropped onto Blake's structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. The impacts caused the roof of his defense to buckle and the bottom container to bow and crush from the weight and heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. After 10 cars, the crate was near collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. Despite the heavy damage to the defense, the Lamborghini survived Phase 3 intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

## Phase 4: Train Impact
The final phase required Blake to protect the Lamborghini from a massive train barreling down train tracks at 35 miles per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

### Preparation
Blake believed the best way to stop a train was to derail it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. He planned to stack railroad ties under the train, hoping to lift it two inches off the track to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. He stated that while railroad ties cost him the challenge last time, they would save him this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. He also planned to add concrete on top of the ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

### Construction
Blake worked throughout the night, stacking cars from Phase 3 onto the train tracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. He continued to add shipping containers, mattresses to cushion impact, and water tanks to the tracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. The final defense incorporated resources from all previous phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. Blake was visibly exhausted from the continuous work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

### Outcome
The train was backed up to gain significant speed before impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. The train hit Blake's extensive barrier at 35 miles per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. The defense successfully derailed the train <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>, stopping it before it could destroy the Lamborghini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.

## Conclusion
Blake successfully completed all four phases of the [[Lamborghini protection challenge | Lamborghini Protection Challenge]], winning the Lamborghini and an additional $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. He stopped 10,000 bullets, caught the car from 100 feet, deflected 10 flaming cars, and derailed a train <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

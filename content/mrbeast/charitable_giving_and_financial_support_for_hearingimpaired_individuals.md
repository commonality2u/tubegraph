Efforts have been made to provide significant support to hearing-impaired individuals, encompassing both access to advanced technology and direct financial aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Providing Hearing Technology
Over $3 million worth of cutting-edge hearing technology was acquired to help people hear again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This technology is designed to analyze specific hearing needs and allow individuals to hear without causing damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The initiative aimed to help 1,000 deaf individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> and had already assisted over 40 people in hearing again at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

This aid has enabled individuals like a woman who hadn't heard her mother's voice in four years to regain her hearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Other recipients include Kayleah, Sudy, entire families, and Aisha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. One senior woman, who hadn't heard properly for 67 years, also received assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

The reach of these efforts extends internationally. Expeditions were made to Mexico to help 200 deaf people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, including Leo Bardo and Selmai, who wished to hear their daughter's voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Support was also provided in Guatemala, Brazil, South Africa, Malawi, and Indonesia, helping hundreds of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

## Direct Financial and Material Support
In addition to hearing technology, recipients often received [[charitable_donations_to_people_in_need|direct financial gifts]]:
*   Many individuals were surprised with $10,000 each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   One individual with 12 grandkids received $12,000 to give a grand to each grandchild <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   A couple whose jet ski broke down received a brand-new jet ski <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   A young patient received custom pink hearing aids and an opportunity to shop freely for toys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   Some recipients received tickets to major events, such as a championship basketball game for a family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a> or a Taylor Swift concert for another individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Supporting Sign Language Education
Recognizing that providing hearing isn't the only way to connect people, a donation of $100,000 was made to organizations worldwide that teach [[promoting_and_supporting_sign_language_education|sign language]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. This initiative acknowledges the importance of sign language in connecting people, regardless of their hearing ability, and addresses the limited access to sign language education in many areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

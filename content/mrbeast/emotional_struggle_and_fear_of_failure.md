Mack, a contestant in a series of challenges, initially claimed he wasn't afraid of anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. However, this assertion was quickly tested through a gauntlet of fears designed to elicit strong [[emotional aspects of competition | emotional responses]]. The overarching goal for Mack was to successfully [[facing fears for a cash prize | face all fears]] to win $800,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Initial Manifestations of Fear

The first challenge involved enduring ten minutes with a thousand spiders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Despite his initial bravado, Mack admitted to "getting there a little bit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> in terms of fear, finding the experience "way more gnarly than I thought it would be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

The second challenge, the fear of heights, required him to unclip from a safety harness and freefall 200 feet from a plank without knowing how he would be caught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Mack was visibly shaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a> and confessed he looked "pretty scared" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The host acknowledged this was [[emotional dynamics in competitions | an emotional dynamic]] when offering an out: "If you want to, you can tap out and just admit that you are wrong and you do get scared" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

During a challenge where Mack had to retrieve duffel bags of money from a sinking car, he stated, "I will never tell you that I'm scared, but I'm about as close as you can be right now to that feeling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This [[psychological and physical challenges | challenge]] tested not only his swimming ability (he was a "borderline Olympic swimmer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>) but also his composure under pressure as the car rapidly sank deeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## The Psychological Toll of Isolation

A significant [[psychological and physical challenges | psychological challenge]] arose when Mack was buried alive for 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. This scenario directly tapped into his personal [[emotional effects of longterm challenges | nightmares]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. The challenge design meant he didn't know the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>, adding immense mental strain to the physical confinement. He confessed, "I'm already freaked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

Mack's initial strategy to track time by staying awake for two hours and sleeping for ten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a> quickly fell apart. He became bored early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a> and his time perception was "horrendously off" within 45 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. The difficulty of staying asleep for more than 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a> exacerbated his confusion, leading to moments of genuine distress: "I have no idea what time it is right now. I'm a little creeped out. Hopefully for the love of God it's been over 12 hours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. The longer he remained, the more disoriented he became <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

The [[the psychological and emotional challenges of isolation | claustrophobia]] began to severely impact him: "Being in this coffin is scary. Like... The longer I'm in here, the worse I feel. It's a crazy feeling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. He also experienced physical discomfort, noting loss of blood flow and back pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. Despite the immense pressure to call it, he managed to stay in for 36 hours, well past the 24-hour requirement, winning $700,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. This demonstrated his resilience in [[the psychology of overcoming extreme challenges | overcoming extreme challenges]].

## The Ultimate Fear: Failure Itself

The final challenge was explicitly titled "the fear of failure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. This was a 1:1 recreation of a previous challenge where Mack had lost $800,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, making it his "worst fear ever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. His immediate reaction upon seeing the setup was visceral: "No, no, no. I'm not doing that again... This is from my nightmares, man. I do not want to be here again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.

The stakes were incredibly high, representing a [[risk versus reward challenges | risk versus reward challenge]]. If he failed, he would lose the remaining $700,000, meaning "it will have been the second time it's happened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>, and a total of "$1.5 million lost on this set" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. Mack described the decision to continue as a "very, very big decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

Despite the intense psychological pressure, Mack decided to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. Unlike the previous attempt where he broke a cookie, this time, Mack demonstrated a changed strategy and composure. He moved quickly through the easier shapes to save time for the most difficult one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>, the umbrella, which was the shape he had previously failed on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.

In the end, it was not the spiders, heights, or sinking car that presented the biggest challenge. The host concluded that "The only thing that ended up getting to Mack... was the fear of his own failure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>, underscoring the profound impact of past failures on his current [[emotional aspects of competition | emotional state]] and [[use of fear as motivation in competitions | motivation]].

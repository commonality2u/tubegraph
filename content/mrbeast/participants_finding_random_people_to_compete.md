In a unique endurance challenge, participants were tasked with finding [[finding_a_random_person_challenge | random individuals]] to compete on their behalf in a giant bowl of cereal and powdered milk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This format added an interesting layer to the [[unique_competition_formats | competition dynamics]], emphasizing the ability to recruit and support.

## The Challenge Setup
The main participants — initially dressed as cereal mascots like Captain Crunch, Mr. Trix, Fred Flintstone, and Tony the Tiger — were informed that instead of competing themselves in a "last to leave" challenge, they would each need to find a [[finding_a_random_person_challenge | random person]] in public to represent them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The incentive for the chosen contestant was a $10,000 prize if they were the last to leave the massive cereal bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Additionally, the participant who selected the winning random person would receive $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Recruitment Process
The main participants, including Chris, Chandler, Jake, and "Tony the Tiger," set out to find their respective contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

*   **Chris's Recruit**: Chris initially tried to recruit a person named Connor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, who was already known to him, prompting a playful jab from another participant about getting a "better person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Ultimately, Connor did compete for Chris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Chandler's Recruit**: Chandler approached Ty on the street and asked if he wanted to sit in a pool of cereal for $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Ty agreed, stating "Why not, let's do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Jake's Recruit**: Jake selected Scotch, asking if he wanted to win $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Scotch readily agreed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Tony the Tiger's Recruit**: Tony the Tiger found Becca, asking if she wanted to be in a YouTube video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Becca's initial reaction upon meeting Tony the Tiger was thinking "this is how I die," but she found the idea of sitting in a bowl of cereal "every nine year old's dream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

This [[audience_participation_in_challenges | recruitment method]] introduced a diverse group of [[contestants_from_ages_1_to_100_competing_for_a_prize | contestants]] into the challenge.

## Contestant Support and Dynamics
Once the contestants were in the "world's largest bowl of cereal," their partners were responsible for providing support and supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This led to varied [[contestant_strategies_and_dynamics | support strategies]]:

*   **Becca's Support (Tony the Tiger)**: Becca received multiple towels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, granola bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, chocolate muffins, bananas for potassium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, a book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, Gatorade and Powerade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, a floaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>, and a large glass of orange juice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Tony the Tiger expressed strong confidence in Becca winning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Ty's Support (Chandler)**: Ty received Chick-fil-A chicken nuggets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a> and Polynesian sauce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. Chandler's support was perceived as less consistent, with one participant commenting, "Chandler's not a good coach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a> and "Chandler couldn't even stay here for five seconds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   **Connor's Support (Chris)**: Connor received sushi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, and an inflatable neck pillow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Chris emphasized the financial investment he made in Connor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   **Scotch's Support (Jake)**: Scotch received a steak and lobster meal with biscuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>, three water bottles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, an inflatable unicorn, Rice Krispie Treats, Capri Suns, M&Ms, Honey Buns, and Spinwheels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

The partners' commitment to their chosen [[contestant_competition_strategies | contestants]] became a significant factor in the [[competition_dynamics_in_endurance_challenges | endurance challenge]].

## Contestant Reactions and Motivations
The [[participant_reactions_to_unusual_tasks | contestants]] displayed various attitudes throughout the challenge:
*   Becca, despite the grossness and cold, remained committed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, although she eventually felt hypothermic and left after six hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   Ty was determined, stating he could last "five, six, seven" more hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. He also expressed a desire to win to "go to Disney World" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. He left after seven hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.
*   Connor was very determined, claiming he could go another "six days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, and also wished to go to Disney World <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   Scotch expressed his [[contestants_motivations_for_winning | motivation]] to win and hold onto the prize money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

## The Outcome
After 14 hours, Connor, battling the cold, decided to exit the bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. This meant that Scotch, Jake's recruited contestant, was the last person remaining in the bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. As a result, Scotch won $10,000, and Jake, for picking the winner, received $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. Scotch used his winning moment to plug his Twitch stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

A YouTube challenge was organized where 11 YouTubers competed to win a private jet valued at $2.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The core rule of this [[unique_giveaways_and_competitions | competition]] was that participants had to keep one hand on the private jet; if they removed their hand at any point, they would be eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The rules also specified that participants could not push each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Challenge Progression

Initially, contestants positioned themselves strategically on the jet, with some opting for lower, seemingly more comfortable spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. An "army of people" was employed to constantly monitor participants' hands to ensure adherence to the rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### Early Eliminations and Deals
*   **Vik** was the first contestant eliminated, seen lifting his hand from the jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Chunkz** was offered a debit card with a spending limit of $10,000 to leave the [[challenge_to_win_money | challenge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. While considering the offer, another participant, Speed, accidentally removed his hand while high-fiving Chunkz, leading to Speed's elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Will** negotiated a deal where he would receive $20,000 from the winner to take his hand off the jet, leading to his voluntary elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

### Increasing Difficulty
To make the challenge harder, the entire airport was rented, and the private jet was driven around, forcing contestants to move with it while maintaining hand contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. After two hours, contestants needed a bathroom break and were instructed to use a "bucket method" while still keeping one hand on the jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

Contestants were eventually allowed inside the jet, but only contact with the exterior counted towards the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. One contestant, George, was honest about touching a chair inside, which was not allowed, leading to his self-elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

The jet was then flown for over an hour, with the pilot circling the airport, a fact revealed only upon landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Meals, such as steak and spaghetti, were provided to make eating difficult with one hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

### Final Stages and Winner
As the challenge progressed, rules were modified:
*   Contestants were paired up, and their non-contact hands were taped together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   A "red tape" line was introduced on the jet, restricting the area where hands could be placed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   Later, contestants were restricted to only keeping one finger on the jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

A coin flip determined Callux's elimination, freeing him from the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Another contestant, George, was eliminated after video footage showed his hand coming off the jet for a single frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

The final two contestants were George and Harry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. After reviewing footage, it was revealed that George's finger had lifted from the jet, making **Harry** the winner of the private jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. Harry announced he would give the jet to his brother and sister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

## Environmental Considerations
The organizers stated they would offset all carbon emissions from the video's filming tenfold, and also offset any future carbon emissions by the jet's winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

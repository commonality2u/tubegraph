Throughout various high-value vacation experiences, opportunities arose to meet and interact with notable public figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. These encounters ranged from collaborative experiences with fellow YouTubers to staying in lodgings favored by world leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

## Collaborating with The Sidemen

During a $100,000 vacation in Switzerland, the Sidemen were invited to join the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. They stayed in the most expensive penthouse suite in Europe, covering an entire floor of the hotel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This elite hotel is renowned for hosting world leaders and presidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

Notable interactions with The Sidemen included:
*   **Security Features Exploration** The group tested the hotel's security measures, including two-inch thick bulletproof windows and a panic button that could lock down the entire building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Pressing the panic button resulted in doors closing and a warning about a large fine if activated again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Presidential Travel Simulation** They experienced traveling like a president, complete with an entourage of bodyguards and a motorcade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. This garnered significant public attention, with people filming them as if they were actual presidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. The simulated presidential travel even extended to a McDonald's visit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

## First Meeting with PewDiePie

As part of a $250,000 vacation in Japan, a highly anticipated meeting with YouTuber PewDiePie (Felix) took place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. This was their first in-person meeting, despite a long history of friendship and mutual support, including a past subscriber race against T-series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

The meeting occurred at Fuji-Q Highland, an amusement park known for Japan's scariest rides, which was rented out entirely for the occasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

### Roller Coaster Experience
PewDiePie joined in riding the park's craziest coaster, which features the steepest roller coaster drop in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. The ride was particularly terrifying, as it also went backwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. Despite initial fear, the experience was described as "the best roller coaster ever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

## Other Notable Mentions

The hotel in Switzerland chosen for the $100,000 vacation was frequented by world leaders and presidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

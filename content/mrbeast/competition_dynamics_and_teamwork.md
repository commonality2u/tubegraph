The "$100,000 Hide and Seek" challenge is set in an abandoned hospital with over 100 rooms and six surrounding buildings, offering a significant prize of $100,000 to the last person untouched by the hunter, Jimmy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This high-stakes environment immediately sets up [[competition dynamics in endurance challenges]] that influence both individual strategies and [[team dynamics and alliances in competitions]].

## Initial Phase: Individual Survival

At the outset, contestants scatter to hide individually within the vast complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Early attempts to evade Jimmy involve finding complex hiding spots, such as climbing onto roofs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a> or seeking refuge in numerous rooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The first person caught, Sam, was tagged after tripping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Emergence of Hunter Teamwork

After catching Sam, Jimmy announces a significant shift in the game's [[competition dynamics in endurance challenges]]: Chris will now join him in hunting down the remaining contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This forms the first explicit instance of [[competitive teamwork]] and a hunting [[team_dynamics_and_alliances_in_competitions]].

Their [[competitive strategy and teamwork]] includes:
*   **Coordinated Searching** The duo systematically searches rooms and areas, communicating sightings and directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Trapping Strategies** They attempt to corner players, such as when trying to catch Chandler on the roof by having Chris camp the stairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Adaptability** When a plan fails, they quickly adjust; for example, after Nolan escapes, Jimmy and Chris devise new coordinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Player Alliances and Betrayal

While most players maintain individual strategies, some attempts at [[teamwork and alliances during competitive events]] emerge:
*   **Temporary Hiding Alliances** Karl and Chandler attempt to hide together under the money, believing they will be the "final two" undetected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Information Exchange/Betrayal** Sapnap strikes a deal with Jimmy, offering Karl's exact location in exchange for a tweet promoting his channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. This demonstrates how alliances can be fluid and conditional in [[friendship and competition dynamics]]. Karl is later caught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, confirming Sapnap's information was accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Joint Escapes** Some players attempt to escape together, such as when two players hide in Jimmy's car and drive it away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

## Shifting Team Composition and Challenges

The physical demands of the challenge take a toll, influencing [[team collaboration and competition in building]] the strategy:
*   **Injuries** Chris injures his leg, rendering him unable to continue hunting effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **Team Adjustments** Karl temporarily joins Jimmy as a hunter, filling in for Chris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. This new pairing tries to coordinate their search efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

## Intensifying Hunt and Final Outcomes

As the number of remaining players dwindles, Jimmy and his team intensify their efforts:
*   **Confined Zone** The hunting zone is restricted to just the hospital building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   **Bait Strategy** A briefcase with $10,000 is placed in the hospital's center, serving as bait to draw out hiding players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. Most players, like Chandler, recognize this as a trap due to the duration of the competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
*   **Psychological Tactics** Jimmy uses psychological tactics, such as pretending to see someone or making noise to draw out hiders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

Ultimately, the hunters catch all but one contestant. Chandler is caught in the cafeteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>, and Chris is also caught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. Karl is returned to the "jail" area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

In the final moments, Jimmy hunts Jordan and Sapnap alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Jordan is eventually caught in a bathroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>, leaving Sapnap as the final victor, who wins $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Every competitor receives $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

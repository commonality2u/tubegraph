In high-stakes competitions, contestants employ various [[winning_strategies_in_competitions | strategies and tactics]] to navigate challenges and secure victory. These approaches can range from observation and adaptation to aggressive moves and even exploiting hidden rules or deceptive elements set by the host.

## Observational and Adaptive Strategies

Contestants often utilize observation to gain an advantage in the laser security course.
*   **Following a perceived safe path**: Early in the challenge, Karl explicitly states, "I'm just gonna follow Nolan since he's safe" to avoid losing a life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01"></a>.
*   **Learning patterns**: As the laser course progresses, contestants like Chandler aim to "learn the pattern" of the lasers to successfully navigate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56"></a>.
*   **Adapting to changing difficulty**: When multiple laser colors are introduced, players acknowledge the increased difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21"></a>.

## Aggressive and Swift Execution

Speed and decisiveness are critical, especially when incentives are offered.
*   **No hesitation**: After losing a life, Nolan declares, "Doing this fast now, no more waiting" to avoid further penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46"></a>. This rapid approach sometimes leads to securing hidden advantages, such as Chris finding an extra life immediately upon entering a new stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48"></a>.
*   **Prioritizing objectives**: Nolan immediately goes for a bonus $10,000 prize by sprinting through a laser course without waiting for the host's full explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37"></a>. This leads to him winning the bonus despite losing a life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06"></a>.
*   **Anticipating changes**: Karl successfully jumps through a laser grid "before it turned off," demonstrating a proactive approach based on predicting laser movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05"></a>.

## Exploiting Game Mechanics and Host Deception

The host, MrBeast, introduces deceptive elements and surprises that contestants must either overcome or potentially leverage.
*   **Hidden advantages**: MrBeast strategically places extra lives throughout the course without informing the contestants, requiring alertness to find them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36"></a>. Chandler notably finds one by observing "something on the ground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31"></a>.
*   **Distractions**: MrBeast attempts to distract contestants from a missing diamond by placing an extra life in its usual spot, hoping they "won't even realize the diamond's missing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06"></a>.
*   **Changing rules/conditions**: The host introduces a "flickering" laser mechanism that Nolan missed by going too fast, demonstrating how understanding the full mechanics could prevent losing lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02"></a>.
*   **Creative problem-solving**: In the final stage, contestants must use two stools to reach a diamond without touching the floor. Nolan employs a "misclick" that results in him receiving help from the host <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26"></a>, while also strategically moving his stools to advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06"></a>.

## Collaborative and Individual [[Strategies and tactics used by contestants | Approaches]]

While the competition is individual, moments of collaboration or observing others influence decisions.
*   **Teamwork under duress**: When Karl and Chandler are handcuffed together, they must coordinate their movements to navigate the laser course, using phrases like "step, step, step" and "shimmy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01"></a>.
*   **Individual resilience**: Contestants like Nolan demonstrate strong balance and precision during the balance beam challenge, successfully crossing without falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00"></a>.

The competition highlights various [[contestant_competition_strategies | competition strategies]], emphasizing the [[the_role_of_luck_and_strategy_in_competitive_games | balance of strategic thinking]] and quick execution, often under pressure from the host's unexpected challenges. Nolan ultimately wins the $100,000 diamond and an additional $10,000 for his sister through a combination of speed and effective use of the available tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04"></a>.

Finding valuable items in dumpsters, as demonstrated in a challenge between Chris and Weddle, involves a combination of careful searching, knowing what to look for, and understanding the appraisal process. The goal of such a challenge is to find "the most valuable stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a> to win a cash prize, initially $10,000, which was later increased to $12,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## The Appraisal Process

A key aspect of determining value is the appraisal. A professional appraiser was initially used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Later, Chandler 2.0 (via FaceTime) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a> and ultimately Jimmy himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a> took over appraisal duties. [[appraising_found_items | Appraising found items]] involves assessing condition, functionality, and market demand.

## Factors Affecting Item Value

Several factors influence the value of items found:

*   **Condition:** Items in "pretty good condition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a> or "still in the box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a> generally fetch higher prices. Worn items like shoes may be worth less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **Functionality:** Electronic items like a straightener <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a> or a guitar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a> are appraised higher if they are working.
*   **Contents:** Luggage "filled with cat poop" significantly lowers its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, even if the luggage itself is considered "luxury" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Uniqueness/Brand:** L.L.Bean slippers were valued at $10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. A functional calculator from the 1990s was valued at $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, possibly due to its working condition. A sword found was appraised at $25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   **Peculiarities:** An ant in cherry tomatoes surprisingly *increased* their value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, though this seems to be an exception.
*   **Market Demand/Practicality:** Items like a full bagel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a> or Q-tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a> are generally not valuable at a pawn shop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. However, an iPhone XS box alone could be worth $40 on eBay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

## Strategies for Finding Items

Participants primarily employed direct searching within the dumpsters.

*   **Physical Search:** Chris and Weddle would "hop in the dumpster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a> to search for items.
*   **Initial Scan:** Sometimes, valuable items like a ring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a> or a couch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a> were found *outside* the dumpster.
*   **Patience and Persistence:** The challenge involved searching 100 dumpsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, implying that not every dumpster yields high-value items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Some were "either empty or extremely gross" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Luck:** Finding a "mother load" of books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a> or Heelys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a> appears to be largely based on chance.
*   **Avoiding Hazards:** Chris refused to enter a large dumpster after seeing a rat, allowing Weddle to search it instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. This highlights the importance of safety.

> [!TIP] Key Learnings
> *   **Condition is paramount:** Clean, functional, and intact items hold higher value.
> *   **Look inside and out:** Valuable items might be adjacent to, rather than within, the dumpster.
> *   **Expect variability:** Many dumpsters may contain nothing of value, requiring persistence through many locations.

While the challenge focused on finding items with a monetary value, [[economic_value_of_discarded_materials | discarded materials]] can hold various forms of worth beyond direct resale.

An initiative was undertaken to cure the blindness of 1,000 individuals worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This effort addressed a significant global issue, as approximately 200 million people experience severe vision impairment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## The Problem and Solution
Nearly half of all cases of blindness globally are curable with a simple 10-minute surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Many individuals live with vision impairment because the lens in their eyes becomes so cloudy they cannot see through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This [[impact_of_visual_impairment_on_daily_life|impact of visual impairment on daily life]] can prevent people from working or performing daily tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

The surgery involves using a tiny vacuum to remove the clouded lens and replacing it with an artificial one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This [[technological_advancements_in_eye_surgery|technological advancements in eye surgery]] makes the procedure straightforward, allowing patients to regain sight almost immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Initial Reactions
Many patients experienced immediate and profound improvements in their vision:
*   "I see everybody" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   "I can see clearer. I can jump for joy!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>
*   "I can see your face" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>
*   "No cloudiness, no blurriness. Oh, it's perfect. I can see everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>
*   "I don't need these [glasses]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>

One woman, initially unable to see, expressed shock upon regaining her sight: "You are pretty ain't you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Another patient, who had suffered from night blindness, described living with it for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a> until the surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Charlie's Story
Charlie, who worked as a cashier, struggled to see how much money to give back due to his deteriorating eyesight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. His vision was so poor he could only identify a letter as an 'E or something' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. His main goal was to regain his vision so he could return to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. After his successful surgery, he was able to read a message revealing he won $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. He expressed deep gratitude, stating he "didn't think I was ever gonna be able to see again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### Seeing Loved Ones
For many, the first thing they wished to see after surgery was a loved one. One man had not truly been himself for 62 years and was eager to see his son's face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Upon seeing his son post-surgery, he became emotional, expressing how much he missed seeing his face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Another patient was able to see everyone's facial features clearly, despite tears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

### Jeremiah's Journey
Jeremiah had been blind in his right eye since birth due to cataracts, impacting his vision throughout his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Because his eye had never received light, the surgery only had a 50% chance of restoring his sight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Post-surgery, everything appeared "so more clear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. To make the day even more special, he received $50,000 for college, which he found hard to believe was real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Satchel's Wish to Drive
Satchel suffered from poor vision from birth, and his eyesight worsened significantly after a go-karting accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. He described his vision as "blur and color," barely able to see shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. His inability to drive meant he spent most of his time at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. After a successful surgery, he no longer saw any blur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a> and could see cars clearly from a distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. To celebrate his regained ability to drive, he was surprised with a brand new Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. He experienced driving for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

## Global Impact
This initiative extended beyond America, reaching other parts of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. This is critical because nearly half of the global population with curable blindness lacks access to this necessary surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. A $100,000 donation was made to help bring sight to thousands more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

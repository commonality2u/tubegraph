The "Isolation Challenge" involved two strangers, Bailey and Suzie, attempting to survive for 100 days inside a massive isolation chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The participants had never met each other before the challenge began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Initial Setup and Participants

The challenge was set up with a specific goal and incentive:
*   **Participants**: Two individuals, Bailey and Suzie, who were complete strangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Their first meeting occurred when their blindfolds were removed inside the chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Location**: A "massive isolation chamber" designed to be a white cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, which one participant likened to an "insane asylum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Duration**: The goal was to survive for 100 days within the cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Prize and Conditions for Winning/Losing

The financial incentive for completing the challenge was substantial:
*   **Prize**: Half a million dollars ($500,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Winning Condition**: Both participants had to survive the entire 100 days in the chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   **Losing Condition**: If either participant left before the 100 days were complete, both would receive nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Chamber Environment and Initial Provisions

The chamber was equipped with basic necessities, but designed to be monotonous:
*   **Food**: Enough food for 100 days was provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. It was healthy, but consisted of "basically the exact same thing over and over again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Facilities**: The chamber included a private bathroom with a shower and no cameras inside, as well as a bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. They were given "everything they need to survive 100 days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Environmental Control**: There was no way for the participants to determine the day or time within the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The lights in the chamber were constantly bright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, causing physical discomfort to their eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## Ongoing [[challenge_format_and_rules | Challenge Format and Rules]]

The [[challenge_format_and_rules | challenge format]] evolved with periodic offers and environmental challenges:
*   **Periodic Offers**: Every ten days, the host would offer an item or service to make the challenge easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
    *   These offers came at a cost, requiring participants to pay with a portion of their prize money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
    *   Offers were tailored based on what the participants were overheard desiring in the cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:56]</a>.
    *   Examples of offers included a private chef (Day 10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, smart beds with light control (Day 20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, coffee, spices, books, phone calls, and Monopoly (Day 30) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, and the option to see family (Day 50) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.
*   **Boundary**: A "red line" existed in the chamber; crossing it would result in the loss of all prize money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **External Events**: On day 34, Hurricane Idalia caused a power outage, disrupting their amenities like the coffee pot, hot food, and hot showers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Power was restored by day 39 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:11:05]</a>.

## The Final Decision

On day 99, with 24 hours remaining in the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>, a final twist was introduced:
*   **Double or Nothing**: Participants were given the choice to "split" their accumulated prize money, or "steal" the other person's money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:55]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: If both chose "split," they would split the money. If one chose "steal" and the other "split," the "stealer" would take all. If both chose "steal," they would both receive nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:58]</a>.
*   **Result**: Both Bailey and Suzie chose "split," resulting in them successfully sharing the prize money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>.

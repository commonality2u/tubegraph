One of the most extreme [[survival_challenges | survival challenges]] undertaken was spending 50 hours buried alive in a coffin underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This [[challenges_of_extreme_survival_scenarios | extreme survival scenario]] tested both mental and physical endurance.

## Challenge Setup and Conditions

The participant, identified as Jimmy, was sealed inside a coffin, describing it as "probably the dumbest thing I've ever done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The coffin was then buried under a substantial amount of dirt, with the participant feeling the weight of the soil above him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. A tombstone was gently placed on top, marking the official start of the [[survival_challenges | challenge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

To ensure safety during this [[dangerous escape room challenges | dangerous challenge]], several precautions were in place:
*   Cameras were installed inside the coffin to monitor the participant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.
*   An AC system supplied air directly to the coffin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   Constant monitoring was conducted by a support team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   A medic was on standby throughout the duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

A condition of the challenge was that if the participant exited early, he would be tased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This served as a deterrent against quitting, despite moments of wanting to give up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

## Experience Underground

From the outset, the experience was terrifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> and claustrophobic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. The confined space of the coffin made movement extremely difficult, leading to feelings of being trapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Daily Life and Hygiene
*   **Bathroom Use**: To address the common skepticism about bathroom breaks in [[survival challenges | challenges]], a system was shown for using the bathroom within the coffin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. However, the participant later chose to hold bowel movements, claiming to have held his poop for over 40 hours rather than using the coffin's facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Boredom and Physical Ailments**: By the 24-hour mark, the participant reported feeling bored, having a sore back, and smelling bad, including the odor of urine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Interactions from Above Ground
The participant's friends provided both support and significant teasing:
*   **Peeing on the Grave**: Friends, particularly Chris, jokingly threatened and simulated peeing on the grave, causing distress to the participant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Annoyances**: They played loud sounds like trains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>, offered tempting food like pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, and messed with the coffin's internal lighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Digging a Tunnel**: At one point, the friends dug a massive hole next to the coffin to "say hi" and draw on the side of the coffin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   **Fireworks**: Towards the end of the challenge, fireworks were set off directly above the grave, with the smoke seeping into the coffin's ventilation system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

## Conclusion of the Challenge

As the 50 hours approached, the participant expressed immense happiness and relief, even shedding tears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Upon being excavated, the participant described the experience as "stupid," reported a massive headache, and was starving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. The clothes worn during the challenge were noted to smell strongly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

The challenge was part of a larger trend of [[mrbeast_challenges | MrBeast challenges]], often involving [[survival_challenge_for_money | survival challenge for money]] incentives for viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

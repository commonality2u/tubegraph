Mark, the winner of the "last to take hand off 1 million keeps it" challenge, quickly made clear his intentions to share his prize money with his family and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The distribution of the prize money involved pre-determined rules, promises, and generous gifts to his loved ones.

## Pre-determined Distributions
Before the Million Dollar Challenge, a rule was established that the contestant's coach would receive 10% of the winnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. As Mark's coach, Chandler received $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Chandler then spent $16,000 at Best Buy and $44,000 on bills, totaling $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

Additionally, during a previous "last to stop biking" video, Mark promised Jeremy $50,000 if he won the million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Jeremy subsequently spent $30,000 and set aside $20,000 for taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

## Mark's Generous Gifts
Mark emphasized that his main focus was to set himself up for the future, make smart purchases like a house and cars, and invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. However, a significant portion of his winnings also went towards improving the lives of his family. Mark's actions demonstrate the [[impact_of_winning_large_cash_prizes | positive impact of winning large cash prizes]] when shared responsibly.

### Gifts and Purchases for Family
Mark used a portion of his winnings for:
*   **Electronics**
    *   Three MacBooks for his wife, cousin, and sister's friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
    *   Surprising his family with items like a PlayStation, VR headset, MacBook, Apple Watch, iPad, and another headset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Vehicles**
    *   Two new cars, one for himself and one for his wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Jewelry**
    *   A new wedding ring for his wife, costing $20,000, replacing her current "cheap" one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Monetary Gifts**
    *   Mark planned to give $15,000 to his mother and another $15,000 to his mother-in-law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>, totaling $30,000 in direct gifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
*   **Matching Gifts**
    *   He also bought a matching Galaxy Watch for MrBeast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

MrBeast frequently devises [[unique_giveaways_and_competitions | unique giveaways and competitions]] that are both challenging and entertaining, often involving a large red triangle as a central element for participants to win money or prizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. A key rule across many of these challenges is that if any part of the item touches the red line of the triangle, the participant loses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Triangle Challenges

### The Electronics Stacking Challenge
In one instance, a participant named Adam was challenged to fit as many electronics as possible into a red triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Utilizing a [[creative_rules_for_winning_prizes | creative approach]], Adam and his team decided to use large TVs as "tables" to create multiple layers of items, effectively maximizing the vertical space within the triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This strategy allowed them to fit over $23,000 worth of merchandise into the designated area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### GameStop "Fill the Store" Challenge
At a GameStop, two participants, Patrick and Dave, were tasked with fitting the entire store's inventory into a triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. They employed a highly strategic method, using a tape measure to calculate the exact dimensions of the triangle and the boxes to achieve a perfect fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Their plan involved building a perimeter of large boxes and then stacking items vertically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Despite the precarious nature of their stack, they successfully managed to fit an astounding amount of merchandise, resulting in them winning the entire GameStop inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### Car Dealership Challenge
A woman named Shirley was given the opportunity to win multiple cars by fitting them into a giant red triangle at a car dealership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. To overcome the challenge of the cars touching the red boundary, special boards were used to guide the vehicles over the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. With assistance from MrBeast's team, Shirley successfully placed five cars, totaling over $100,000, inside the triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. She was overwhelmed with emotion upon realizing she had won all five cars, not just one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### Food Pantry Challenge
Darren, who manages MrBeast's food pantry, was presented with a massive triangle at a Sam's Club, with the aim of filling it with as much food as possible for charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Darren managed to fit over $82,000 worth of food, which was then used to support and service another community every two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. This act highlights the [[amazing_giveaways_and_charitable_acts | charitable aspect]] of MrBeast's [[creative ways to win money or prizes | creative ways to win money or prizes]].

### Skydive Landing Challenge
In a unique twist on the triangle challenge, a skydiver named Dino was offered $20,000 if he could successfully jump from a plane and land inside a red triangle on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. An additional $20,000 was offered if Tareq, who has a fear of heights, also skydived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Dino successfully landed in the triangle, and Tareq completed his jump, resulting in Dino winning $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

### The Hidden Triangle (Misdirection Challenge)
A participant named Neil was challenged to select items from a store, believing the triangle for his items would be small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. MrBeast intentionally used a small pizza box to mislead Neil, causing him to choose fewer items than he might have otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. When the actual, much larger triangle was revealed, Neil realized his mistake but still managed to fit his selected items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

### Friend vs. Friend Triangle Challenge
This challenge involved two friends, Chandler and Chris, where one would fill the triangle, and the other would have to pay for the items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Chandler filled the triangle for Chris, accumulating $6,574.45 worth of items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Chris then filled the triangle for Chandler, totaling $4,558.18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. Despite the costs, they reconciled with a hug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. This format showcases [[creative_approaches_in_winning_prizes | creative approaches in winning prizes]] by involving personal relationships.

### Children's Hospital Donation
A large triangle was set up in a store, and Heather, who works at a children's hospital, was invited to fill it with toys and PlayStation 5 consoles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. All the items were paid for by MrBeast and subsequently donated to a local children's hospital, bringing joy to the children and staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. This exemplifies [[amazing_giveaways_and_charitable_acts | amazing giveaways and charitable acts]].

### Karl's Revenge (Oval Challenge)
As a form of "revenge" for Karl's mistake in a previous challenge, an oval was drawn on his floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. Zealous was then challenged to fit as many of Karl's personal belongings into the oval as possible, which MrBeast would then pay for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. Zealous strategically stacked gaming consoles and a TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. Ultimately, MrBeast bought replicas of all the items Zealous took for Karl, so Karl didn't actually lose anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

The "Finding a Random Person Challenge" is a unique [[youtuber_competition_challenges | YouTuber competition challenge]] where a participant is tasked with locating a specifically described individual anywhere in the world within a tight timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The objective is to [[challenge_to_win_100000 | win $10,000]] if successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This challenge involves elements of [[challenges_and_social_experiments | social experiments]] and often leads to [[unexpected_encounters_during_the_challenge | unexpected encounters]].

## Challenge Parameters

*   **Target Description**: An "old man" wearing a Hawaiian shirt, shorts, and specific shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The participant humorously referred to him as "Mr. Emoji guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   **Time Limit**: 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.
*   **Prize**: $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Challenge Execution

The participant's initial [[strategies_to_locate_someone_in_a_large_area | strategy]] was to travel to Cabo, Mexico, believing it to be a suitable location for a "beach type guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

Upon arriving in Mexico, the participant:
*   Rented a boat immediately to begin the search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   Observed many older men, but none perfectly matched the clothing description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   Encountered numerous individuals who were "almost there" but lacked one specific feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Unexpected Setbacks

After hours of searching, a perfect match was located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. However, this individual declined to participate, stating "he didn't want to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This [[unexpected_outcomes_in_challenges | unexpected outcome]] required a change in approach.

### New Strategy

The participant devised a new [[strategies_to_locate_someone_in_a_large_area | strategy]]: buying ten Hawaiian shirts to leave out, hoping people might start wearing them and inadvertently match the description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Resolution

As the challenge neared its end, with only two hours remaining, the participant began to feel defeated and considered it might not be possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. However, with only an hour left, a [[surprise_elements_and_distractions_during_the_challenge | surprising discovery]] occurred: the target person was found sitting in the lobby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The lucky individual was informed that he had just [[challenge_to_win_money | won $10,000]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

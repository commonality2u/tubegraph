A group undertook a 24-hour challenge of [[survival_challenges_at_sea | surviving at sea]] within [[the_bermuda_triangle_myths_and_mysteries | The Bermuda Triangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This area is known for its reputation as one of the most dangerous places on Earth, with over 100 ships and planes reportedly going missing without explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Preparing for the Unknown
Before embarking on the challenge, participants were asked to prepare their last will and testament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   One participant specified leaving his dog and other belongings to his family, while declaring his ostrich a "free man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   Another committed to leaving his house, cars, dogs, cats, and all money to his wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   A third willed his car (a gift from Jimmy) and Xbox to his mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   Viking left his boat to his dad and everything except his web history to Shelby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Initial Challenges at Sea
Upon entering [[the_bermuda_triangle_myths_and_mysteries | The Bermuda Triangle]], the participants experienced severe [[coping_with_weather_and_wildlife_at_sea | seasickness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. The water conditions were initially very rough, prompting a request to the captain to seek calmer waters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. After moving, the waves were noticeably smaller, and some participants felt better, though one reported throwing up 11 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Activities and Incidents
Despite the initial discomfort, the group engaged in several activities:
*   **Jumping off the Yacht** Chris was the first to jump into the water while in the [[the_bermuda_triangle_myths_and_mysteries | Bermuda Triangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **Last to Fall Competition** A challenge where the last person to fall off a floating platform would win $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Chandler ultimately won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Cool Trick Competition** Participants jumped off the yacht attempting the coolest trick for a $2,000 prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Chandler was declared the winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Lost Camera** A $7,000 camera accidentally fell into the water, becoming the only casualty during the early part of the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

## Perceptions of the Triangle's Danger
Early on, some participants found [[the_bermuda_triangle_myths_and_mysteries | The Bermuda Triangle]] surprisingly pleasant while on a yacht, suggesting that previous disappearances might have occurred because the area was too appealing to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Hide and Seek Challenge
A game of hide and seek was played on the yacht, with Jimmy counting to 500 and the last person found winning $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Chandler won this challenge by hiding on top of the boat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

## Nighttime Occurrences
Later that night, the group experienced "disturbing stuff," which included pranks like waking Chandler up to hide from him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>, and other members dressed as ghosts attempting to scare others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

## Conclusion of the Challenge
After 24 hours, the group successfully completed their time in [[the_bermuda_triangle_myths_and_mysteries | The Bermuda Triangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Despite the initial [[coping_with_weather_and_wildlife_at_sea | seasickness]] and a lost camera, the perceived dangers of [[the_bermuda_triangle_myths_and_mysteries | The Bermuda Triangle]] were ultimately attributed to motion sickness and camera equipment issues, rather than mysterious disappearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

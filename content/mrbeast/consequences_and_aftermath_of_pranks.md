## The Prank: Filling a House with Elephant Toothpaste

In the video, MrBeast decides to prank his brother CJ by filling his house with elephant toothpaste. This was a response to CJ's own prank of covering Karl's house in sticky notes [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">00:00:03</a>]. Assisted by [[working_with_experts_for_pranks | Mark Rober]], an expert who holds world records for elephant toothpaste experiments, they prepared an impressive 14 drums of the foam to flood the house [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">00:04:30</a>].

### Safety Risks
Creating and handling such large quantities of elephant toothpaste poses safety risks, including potential chemical burns from hydrogen peroxide and the structural integrity of the house.

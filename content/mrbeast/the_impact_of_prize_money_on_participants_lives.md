In a high-stakes challenge, a professional bounty hunter was offered a [[large_cash_prizes_in_competitive_events | $100,000 prize]] if he successfully hunted down his target, who was attempting to evade capture until midnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This significant sum served as a powerful [[prize_incentives_and_participant_decisions | incentive]] throughout the chase.

## The Prize Incentive

The prospect of winning [[large_cash_prizes_in_competitive_events | $100,000]] strongly motivated the bounty hunter and his team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The bounty hunter himself expressed a strong desire to "go get it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, and later emphasized his need for the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Despite becoming exhausted during the intense pursuit, he affirmed that the reward was "worth it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. The target, Jimmy, was equally motivated by the prize, stating that "all it takes is one slip up and I lose a hundred thousand dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, which drove him to continuously evade capture.

## Winner's Intentions

Upon successfully capturing the target and securing the [[winning_and_allocation_of_prize_money_in_challenges | $100,000]], the bounty hunter revealed his intentions for the prize money. He stated that the money would be transformative for his [[impact_of_winning_on_personal_life | personal life]] and his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. Specifically, he mentioned having a young child at home and that this money would "set him up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>, serving as his child's college fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. This highlights the significant [[impact_of_winning_large_cash_prizes | impact of winning large cash prizes]] on the recipient's long-term financial planning and family welfare.

This article details the various experiences and [[contestant_eliminations_and_reasons | eliminations]] of 50 participants in a challenge to win a $300,000 Lamborghini by being the last person to keep their right hand on the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The challenge utilized over 50 cameras to monitor every hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Early Departures

The competition saw rapid [[contestant_eliminations_and_reasons | eliminations]] due to unexpected occurrences and the inherent difficulty of the challenge.

*   **Windshield Wiper Use**: To allow bathroom breaks while maintaining contact, a windshield wiper was detached and provided, allowing contestants to hold it while touching the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Water Splash**: The first contestant was eliminated when a water splash caused them to instinctively react and remove their hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This individual received $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Accidental Touch**: Another contestant was eliminated when someone stepped on their foot, causing them to move their hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Falling Object**: A contestant was caught on camera removing their hand to pick up a fallen water bottle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Temptation Eliminations

To reduce the number of participants, various temptations were introduced, testing [[contestants_decision_making | contestants' decision-making]] and focus.

*   **Car Offer**: A new Nissan was offered to the next person to get out, leading one contestant to voluntarily step away within 10 seconds to claim the prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Sleeping Bags**: Sleeping bags were provided at midnight, with the host hoping participants would fall asleep and accidentally remove their hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This strategy proved effective, as some contestants slept on the ground to avoid accidental hand movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, but others were eliminated for falling asleep and taking their hand off, receiving $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. By morning, 28 contestants remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Car Revving**: To create mischief, the car was loudly revved, startling a contestant into removing their hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Basketball Shot Challenge**: As a distraction and temptation, contestants were offered $10,000 for making a basketball shot while the host advertised a documentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. David successfully won the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Mustang/Camaro Race**: Another car, identified as a Camaro, was offered to the first contestant to touch it, leading to a scramble and multiple [[contestant_eliminations_and_reasons | eliminations]] as contestants ran to claim it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Four contestants were eliminated during this event, leaving 16 remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   **Steak Dinner**: Steak was provided to the remaining 16 contestants, proving difficult to eat with only one hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. One contestant was caught on camera removing their hand while eating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Money Cannon**: Money was fired from a cannon in an attempt to make contestants remove their hands to pick it up, but this strategy did not result in any [[contestant_eliminations_and_reasons | eliminations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

## Reaching the Top 10

After more than a day, 30 people had been eliminated, with the host aiming to reach the top 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

*   **Sleep Eliminations**: Two more contestants were eliminated for removing their hands during sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Duct Tape**: Upon reaching the final 10, contestants were allowed to duct-tape their hands to the car for the night to get some sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. However, this measure was largely ineffective, as half of the remaining contestants were eliminated overnight despite the tape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Footage showed various reasons for removal:
    *   Danny's hands were clearly off the car while asleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
    *   David's luck ran out when an itchy nose caused him to remove his hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
    *   Neil had no contact whatsoever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
    *   Akira's brother removed his hand to scratch his head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Prize Room**: The top 10 contestants were rewarded with access to a prize room where they could take items like iPhones, iPads, and cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## The Final Stretch

With only 6 contestants remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>, the challenge intensified.

*   **Lamborghini Elevated**: The Lamborghini was raised 2 feet off the ground, adding a new physical challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **Nolan's Departure**: Nolan was eliminated after accidentally lifting the trunk of the car, causing his hand to come off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. He received $10,000 for making it so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Akira's Voluntary Exit**: With 4 players left, Akira, at his "breaking point," negotiated a guaranteed spot in the next challenge and $10,000 cash in exchange for removing his hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   **Increased Height**: The Lamborghini was raised even higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Single Finger Rule**: To make it harder after 10 hours without an elimination, contestants had to switch from holding with their whole hand to a single finger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Most chose their pointer finger, while one chose their pinky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.
*   **Cash Buyouts**: As physical and mental fatigue set in, contestants began to negotiate [[contestants_decision_making | buyouts]]:
    *   One contestant proposed $20,000 and a MacBook, which was accepted, leading to their elimination in 4th place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
    *   Another contestant asked for $25,000 to cover student loans and two broken phones, which was also accepted, leaving only two contestants remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

## The Final Two

The last two contestants, Fidias and another participant, faced extreme tension with the Lamborghini raised even higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. The physical toll was evident, with one contestant's finger shaking uncontrollably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. The second-place prize of $40,000 was offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. Eventually, one contestant could no longer bear the pain and removed their finger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

Fidias emerged as the winner, claiming the $300,000 Lamborghini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>, while the runner-up received $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. The challenge highlighted the immense mental toughness required to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, with one contestant remarking, "This far in, it's a different realm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

This article explores the vast differences in luxury, size, and amenities across various yacht tiers, from a mere $1 boat to a colossal $1 billion superyacht <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The $1 Yacht

The cheapest yacht in this comparison cost only $1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The previous owner sold it for such a low price because its annual storage cost was $18,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Upon boarding, it became clear why it was so inexpensive: the floor was unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, and the boat began sinking immediately after being put in the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This tier highlights the [[experiences_and_challenges_on_different_yacht_tiers | challenges]] of owning even a seemingly affordable boat.

## The $1 Million Yacht

The $1 million yacht was smaller than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. However, its [[features_and_amenities_of_luxury_yachts | amenities]] included a surprisingly large living room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, a lower deck with a master bedroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, another bedroom that was too short to stand in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, and double beds for kids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The seats were made of hot leather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## The $10 Million Yacht

The $10 million yacht offered a significant upgrade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. It was notably larger than the previous tier, especially the front of the boat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Its [[features_and_amenities_of_luxury_yachts | amenities]] included a spacious bedroom allowing occupants to stand comfortably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, four additional massive bedrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, and a bidet in the bathroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The upstairs seating area featured soft seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## The $25 Million Yacht

This yacht was designed to accommodate up to 150 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. It boasted 30 rooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, a living room, an office, a massage parlor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, two dining rooms, and seven bedrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. A world-class chef was part of the crew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Notably, this yacht featured a helipad, allowing for [[special_guests_and_events_on_luxury_yachts | unique deliveries]] such as pizza via helicopter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. It also came equipped with jet skis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## The $50 Million Yacht

It came with a 20-person crew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a> and a remote control that could summon the crew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a> and operate a hidden pop-up TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. The sheer size made it difficult to gauge where one was on the boat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. [[special_guests_and_events_on_luxury_yachts | Special guests]] like Pete Davidson and celebrities like Mr. Beast's associates enjoyed a lamb dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## The $1 Billion Superyacht

This colossal vessel is described as a "floating city" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, four times bigger than the $300 million yacht <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a> and larger than three Statues of Liberty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. It is 1200 feet wide, 17 stories high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, and can accommodate almost 10,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

The ship is divided into seven neighborhoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>, featuring shops, restaurants, arcades, a Starbucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>, a carousel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>, and an entire floor for indoor shows and events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

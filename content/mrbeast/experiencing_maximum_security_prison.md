A group of friends, including Jimmy and Nolan, voluntarily spent 50 hours locked up in a real prison to experience what it's like to be an inmate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. They agreed to be treated exactly like inmates, eating [[prison_food_and_living_conditions | real prison food]], cleaning the prison, and being subjected to the mental warfare of imprisonment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Initial Impressions and [[Prison Food and Living Conditions | Living Conditions]]

Upon entering, participants immediately noted the discomforts of their new environment. The beds were very uncomfortable, described by one as feeling like a blanket laid in the middle of the road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The toilets had a yellow tint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, and the water fountain was deemed disgusting with "something in it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## [[Prison Routines and Activities | Daily Routines]]

The days in prison followed a strict routine enforced by guards.

### Roll Call
Guards conducted roll calls in the middle of the night to ensure no prisoners had escaped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Participants were woken up at 3:00 a.m. for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Waking up in the morning felt like being hit by a truck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### Meals
The first prison meal was described as bland and rated a four out of ten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Participants noted the food became bland very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. For one meal, Jimmy and Nolan were on kitchen duty, preparing food for everyone, including "tons of beans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Boredom during meals led to gambling brownies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. The final meal was "Wieners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

### Showers and Hygiene
Showers were limited to 10 minutes, with no hot water, which felt like torture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Toothbrushes were small, finger-sized devices, designed to prevent stabbings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. The rare opportunity for a hot shower, even for a few minutes, was described as a massive morale boost, making one participant feel "so much better" and "literally about to cry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. This highlights how prison strips away simple comforts, making basic amenities feel like a luxury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

### Recreation (Rec) Time
Rec time offered limited activities like a chessboard, a TV, and a library <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Card games, such as poker, were popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Good behavior was linked to good rec time, while bad behavior led to punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

### Yard Time
Time outside in the courtyard, even if it was just a "tiny cube of grass," was considered a "massive blessing" and felt "very liberating," allowing participants to temporarily forget they were prisoners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Basketball was played during yard time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## [[Interactions with Guards and Other Inmates | Interactions and Conflicts]]

Guards maintained strict control, cuffing inmates every time they left their cells for activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. An inmate remarked that the experience made him feel like he "actually did something illegal now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

Tensions arose among the inmates. When one group played cards during rec time, others got jealous and tried to start a riot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. This escalated to inmates intentionally flooding the prison by causing a "plumbing issue," leading to them being cuffed and put in [[solitary_confinement_challenges | solitary confinement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

During cell checks for contraband, Nolan was found with a knife, claiming it was "only for protection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This resulted in Nolan being sent to [[solitary_confinement_challenges | solitary confinement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. His absence brought "silence" and was initially seen as "nice" by Jimmy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>, but Nolan's screams from isolation later indicated the harshness of the [[solitary_confinement_challenges | confinement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Nolan was temporarily let out of [[solitary_confinement_challenges | solitary confinement]] to eat with the others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

## [[Psychological Effects of Longterm Confinement | Psychological Effects]]

The experience quickly took a toll. Participants felt the passage of time differently, with less than 24 hours feeling like four days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. The objective of prison, in Jimmy's view, was to make you feel like an animal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. The constant interruption of sleep by roll calls was frustrating, and the overall boredom was significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

## [[Prison Visitation and Its Emotional Impact | Visitation]]

Prisoners could only see family or friends through visitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Nolan's "parents" visited, attempting to admonish him for his behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Chris had an emotional visit with his young son, expressing a wish to hold him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Jimmy, on the other hand, paid a lawyer to visit him, only to confuse the lawyer by stating he didn't want to get out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

## Conclusion

Despite the short duration of the experiment, participants found the experience incredibly challenging. One participant expressed being "so tired" and wanting to escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Nolan later made an escape attempt with only three hours remaining in the experiment, highlighting the intense desire for freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. The participants concluded that while their video might make prison "look fun," it is "not fun" in reality, and advised viewers, "Don't go to jail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

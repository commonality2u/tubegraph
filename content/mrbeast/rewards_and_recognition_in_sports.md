In a global competition featuring one person from every country on Earth, participants vied for a significant prize and various forms of recognition throughout the events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The ultimate prize was a $250,000 gold medal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Prize Incentives

### The Grand Prize
The primary [[moneybased_competitions_and_incentives | incentive]] for all contestants was the $250,000 gold medal, which the winner could potentially sell for the same amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. This substantial prize motivated participants, with many stating their intention to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

### Mid-Competition Offer
At a later stage of the competition, when 16 countries remained, contestants were offered a briefcase containing $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. They had the choice to either walk away with the $10,000 or throw the money into a pit and continue competing for the grand prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. This offer highlighted the [[prize_incentives_and_participant_decisions | risk-reward dilemma]] for participants.

> [!NOTE] Decision to Decline $10,000
> Most contestants chose to forfeit the $10,000, driven by confidence in their ability to win the larger $250,000 prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. Only two countries, Fiji and Italy, accepted the $10,000 offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

### Participation Reward
Even those who were eliminated or did not win the main prize received a participation reward. Every contestant who competed received $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.

## Forms of Recognition and Motivation

Beyond monetary prizes, participants were motivated by the honor of representing their countries and achieving success.

### National Representation
A significant aspect of the competition was that each participant represented their home country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This added a layer of pride and motivation, with contestants encouraged to "do it for your country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a> and striving to make their people proud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

### Advancement Through Rounds
Success in each event, such as being among the first to cross hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> or making it to the middle platform in gymnastics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, served as a form of recognition. Each step closer to the gold medal was celebrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Individual Achievement
Participants expressed personal pride in their achievements, such as one contestant stating, "I trusted myself. I believe in myself and I did it" after passing on the $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. Another mentioned not letting age be a factor, aiming to defy doubters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

### Silver Medal Recognition
While not the grand prize, the runner-up received a silver medal, which was accepted positively as their "color" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.

Participants in various [[challenges_and_social_experiments | challenges]] often exhibit a wide range of reactions when faced with unusual and sometimes unsettling tasks. These reactions range from immediate refusal and nervous apprehension to surprising courage and emotional celebrations of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Facing Animal Encounters

Several [[challenges_and_social_experiments | challenges]] involve direct interaction with animals, eliciting strong responses from participants:

*   **Bathtub of Snakes**
    *   Upon seeing a bathtub full of snakes, one participant, Chandler, immediately reacted by stating, "Oh, sorry mom" and swiftly left the scene before the offer of $10,000 for his mother was even completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
    *   Another participant, Chris, experienced a snake constricting slightly on him and questioned if it was "okay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Despite the initial discomfort and learning there would be 20 more snakes, he successfully completed the task, earning $10,000 for his mom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Box of Cockroaches**
    *   When presented with a box containing $15,000 and giant cockroaches, Karl immediately refused, stating, "No chance, dude" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
    *   Jeff, the sound guy, was offered the chance to grab money from the box. He yelled upon contact with a cockroach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, noting that his hand was sweaty after a near miss with a cockroach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. He even agreed to pet a cockroach for an extra second on the timer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, ultimately winning $9,340 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Tarantula Crawl**
    *   Tareq nervously chuckled when asked to let a tarantula crawl on him for 30 seconds for $10,000 for his mom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. He defined his safe word as "Get this spider off of me!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. His mom cheered him on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, and she gasped as the tarantula moved, with Chris noting it "can sense fear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Tareq completed the challenge and celebrated, exclaiming, "I did that!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Rat-Infested Safe Room**
    *   Karl, when tasked with guessing a safe code while rats were incrementally added to the room, reacted with distress, yelling "Stop! Actually?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a> and later, "Holy shi- All around me!" as more rats appeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Despite the distraction, he successfully helped the randomly chosen contestant, Mary, win $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Overcoming Personal Disgust

Participants also faced challenges that preyed on specific aversions:

*   **Bathtub of Pickles**
    *   Chandler, known for being terrified of pickles, stated he was more afraid of pickles than snakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. When offered $20,000 for his sister to sit in a tub of pickles, he screamed and squealed, expressing disgust with "Ew!" and "Get me out!" as his sister pushed him in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. He even gagged afterwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a> but ultimately secured the money for his sister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Navigating Social and Physical Tests

[[Challenges_and_social_experiments | Challenges]] also tested participants' social comfort and physical endurance:

*   **Auditorium Speech to Mannequins**
    *   Randy agreed to read a script in front of a thousand people for $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. He exhibited nervous chuckling while reading the "stupid" script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Upon discovering the audience was actually mannequins, he laughed in disbelief and became visibly emotional, crying tears of joy and gratitude for the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>, planning to give the money to his mom and Mary Beth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. This highlights [[surprise_elements_and_distractions_during_the_challenge | surprise elements]] in challenges.
*   **Endurance Dumbbell Curl**
    *   Noah, initially confident, declared he could curl a one-pound dumbbell for "days" and win "a million dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. After curling for an extended period, earning $32,000, he admitted he couldn't feel his arm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a> and had been "humbled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. When faced with the option to [[surprise_rewards_and_risktaking_in_games | risk]] his winnings to curl a 20-pound dumbbell for an additional $20,000, he chose to "risk it for the biscuit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, successfully completing the task and expressing that the win felt "surreal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.
*   **Blindfolded Balloon Pop**
    *   Regina was confused and chuckled nervously when she was brought into a strange room and asked to wear a blindfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Tasked with popping a balloon containing car keys while blindfolded, she laughed nervously and then screamed and cheered upon successfully popping the balloon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>, excitedly exclaiming, "Oh my god! I just won a car!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

The "Beast Olympics" is an extreme competition featuring one person from every country on Earth, vying to determine the "best country" and win a $250,000 gold medal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The competition involves various athletic and strategic challenges, designed to be more extreme than traditional Olympic events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Competition Structure and Rules
The format includes multiple elimination rounds across different events, with a significant reduction in the number of competing countries after each stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Participants are frequently reminded that they are representing their respective countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

## Events and Challenges

The "Beast Olympics" encompasses a variety of challenges, including track, archery, gymnastics, soccer, and fencing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

### Track Challenge
The first event requires contestants to cross three progressively larger hurdles within 30 seconds before a giant wall closes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This initial challenge saw over half the countries eliminated, with 97 moving on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Indonesia notably secured first place in this event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Gymnastics of Death
Described as the "craziest set," this event features rounds of 10 countries, with only the first five individuals to reach a middle platform advancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. A unique aspect of this challenge is that contestants within a round decide their jump order, leading to instances of [[group_dynamics_and_alliances_in_a_competitive_setting | interpersonal conflict]] and participants stepping over others to advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Fifty more participants were eliminated in this stage, reducing the field to 47 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### Archery
In this event, each contestant uses a bow and arrow to hit a target from a platform to advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. To introduce [[competition_dynamics_and_teamwork | competition dynamics]], contestants vote to make the target more difficult for a country of their choice, with each vote pushing the target back ten feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Indonesia, identified as a "biggest threat" due to strong prior performances, received the most votes (12 votes), resulting in the farthest shot of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. After this round, only 16 countries remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

### Mid-Competition Offer
Before the next event, each of the remaining 16 contestants was offered $10,000 to withdraw from the competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Only two countries, Fiji and Italy, accepted the offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

### Fencing
The fencing event involves one-on-one matches, where the first person to hit their opponent wins and advances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Top finishers from the track event were given the advantage of choosing their opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. The competition uses technology found in the "real Olympics" to detect hits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

### Final Event: Penalty Kicks (Soccer)
The last event, involving seven remaining countries (Slovenia, Moldova, Tajikistan, Eritrea, Libya, Iraq, and Samoa), is penalty kicks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.
*   **Progressive Difficulty:** Initially easy, the goal is progressively narrowed using moving walls to increase difficulty and eliminate players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.
*   **Final Showdown:** The final two competitors, Libya and Slovenia, face a plot twist: they take turns being goalkeepers, with the match continuing until one scores and the other fails to save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

## Outcome
Libya won the $250,000 gold medal, while Slovenia received the silver medal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. All participants in the "Beast Olympics" received $2,000 for their involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.

In competitive scavenger challenges, various tools and [[use_of_technology_and_gadgets_in_modern_treasure_hunts | gadgets]] are introduced to aid or complicate the search for hidden items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. One such tool featured in a challenge is the metal detector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## The Beach Challenge

Participants were tasked with finding a key hidden within a "giant beach" environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. The challenge explicitly allowed the use of a metal detector to locate the metallic key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

During this [[competition_dynamics_in_scavenger_challenges | competition]], one participant actively used the metal detector, confident in its ability to locate the key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. However, [[surprise_elements_and_distractions_during_the_challenge | distractions]] occurred, including other players throwing sand at the person using the detector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The metal detector user initially believed they had found the key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>, but it turned out to be a rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Ultimately, the key was found by other means, though it broke in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Despite the broken key, the team won a $5,000 Home Depot gift card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

Various challenges are presented to individuals, offering [[large_cash_prizes_in_competitive_events | large cash prizes]] or other valuable rewards as [[incentives_and_motivations_in_challenges | motivation]] to complete specific tasks or overcome fears. These [[games_and_contests_with_highvalue_prizes | games and contests with high-value prizes]] test participants' willingness to endure discomfort, perform feats, or make decisions under pressure.

## Challenges and Rewards

### Sitting in a Bathtub of Snakes
A challenge was posed where individuals could earn $10,000 for their mother by sitting in a bathtub full of snakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. One participant, Chandler, immediately declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Another participant successfully completed the challenge, securing $10,000 for his mom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Grabbing Money from a Box of Cockroaches
A box containing $15,000 was filled with giant cockroaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Participants were allowed to keep as much money as they could grab within 60 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. One participant, Jeff, endured the challenge despite the cockroaches and managed to win $9,340 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This showcased [[financial_incentives_for_survival | financial incentives for survival]] and the willingness to face phobias for gain.

### Curling a Dumbbell for Dollars
A seemingly simple challenge involved curling a one-pound dumbbell, with the participant earning a dollar for every curl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Noah undertook this continuous challenge, capable of earning "as much money as you want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. After thousands of curls, Noah had accumulated $32,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. A Theragun was even purchased to assist Noah in continuing his effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### Allowing a Tarantula to Crawl
For $10,000, a participant named Tareq was asked to let a tarantula crawl on him for 30 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. His mother was present to cheer him on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The [[incentives_and_temptation_during_challenges | incentive]] was even doubled to $20,000 if the tarantula were to bite him, though this was stated to be unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Tareq successfully endured the challenge, securing the prize for his mom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Cracking a Safe in a Room with Rats
A contestant could win $20,000 by having Karl guess the code to a safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. The added element of pressure was that a rat was introduced into the room every 10 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. The code was revealed to be related to Karl's birthday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Karl successfully opened the safe, winning $20,000 for the contestant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### Sitting in a Bathtub of Pickles
Leveraging a participant's known fear of pickles, a bathtub was filled with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Chandler, who previously refused $5,000 to eat a pickle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, was offered $20,000 for his sister if he sat in the tub within a minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This was an example of [[relationship_challenges_with_monetary_rewards | relationship challenges with monetary rewards]]. Despite his extreme discomfort and disgust, Chandler completed the task, earning his sister $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

### Reading a Script to an "Audience"
Randy was offered $10,000 cash to read a pre-written script in front of what he believed was an audience of a thousand people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. The script was intentionally "stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. After his performance, it was revealed that the "audience" consisted of mannequins, with only two actual people present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Randy was genuinely emotional upon receiving the $10,000, intending to give it to his mom and another individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

### Choosing a Valuable Painting
Four paintings were presented, one of which was worth $10,000 and the others nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Ashley was tasked with guessing which painting was the valuable one to win it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. After incorrectly picking a painting drawn by Chris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a> and another by Chandler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>, she ultimately failed to identify the $10,000 professional painting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. This highlights [[prize_incentives_and_participant_decisions | participant decisions]] and the role of chance.

### Tug-of-War Challenges
Foy was offered $10,000 to win a tug-of-war against Karl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, which he successfully did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. He then chose to risk his $10,000 for "double or nothing" against two opponents, Karl and Chandler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Foy won this second round, increasing his prize to $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Despite the option to risk it all against a third opponent, Foy decided to take the $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

### Risking Winnings for More Money
Noah, having accumulated $32,000 from dumbbell curls, was offered a [[participant_incentives_and_offers | participant incentive]] to risk his entire winnings to curl a 20-pound dumbbell for an additional $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. He accepted the "risk it for the biscuit" challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. After a strenuous effort, he successfully curled the heavier dumbbell, winning an extra $20,000, bringing his total to $52,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. This exemplifies [[creative_ways_to_win_money or prizes | creative ways to win money or prizes]].

### Popping a Balloon for a Car
Regina, blindfolded and holding a nail, was challenged to pop a balloon hidden in a room within 60 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. Inside the balloon were the keys to a brand new car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Regina successfully located and popped the balloon, winning the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

### Subscription Incentives
At the end of the video, a call to action was made, offering $10,000 to someone who subscribes to the channel within seven days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. This illustrates a direct [[participant_incentives_and_offers | incentive]] for audience engagement.

This article details an extraordinary 100-hour expedition that granted unrestricted access to the Great Pyramids of Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The exploration included ventures into tombs considered "literally illegal to enter" due to their danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, a swim to a secret underground tomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, and ascents to the highest and lowest points of the largest ancient pyramid on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## The Great Pyramid of Giza (Pyramid of Khufu)

The Great Pyramid of Giza, dating back approximately 4,500 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, is believed to have been ordered built by King Khufu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Interior Exploration
A significant passageway within the pyramid leads to what Egyptologists identify as King Khufu's tomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The exploration navigated:
*   **The Grand Gallery** This large room is part of the internal passages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **The King's Chamber** Believed to be the king's final resting spot, this chamber may have once contained the mummified body of the king approximately 4,600 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. However, some researchers hypothesize that another, as-yet-undiscovered chamber within the pyramid might hold the king's true burial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Highest and Lowest Points
The expedition aimed to explore from hundreds of feet below the pyramids to the highest point of the largest ancient pyramid on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Lowest Point** A 300-foot tunnel leads to the deepest point in the pyramid, a massive decoy chamber designed to protect the mummies and treasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.
*   **Highest Point** Fewer than 50 people in modern history are known to have reached the highest chambers inside the Great Pyramid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. These upper chambers include room numbers three, four, and five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.

### Historical Evidence
Graffiti found in the highest chambers, dating back 4,600 years, includes names of work gangs like "Heber" (team) and "Simsu" (friends), as well as the name "Khufu" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. This writing is considered strong evidence by researchers that ancient Egyptians built the pyramids as tombs for their pharaohs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.

## Pyramid of Khafre

The Pyramid of Khafre provided insights into how the casing of each pyramid looked originally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. The exploration went nearly 100 feet below the Earth's surface into this pyramid, a place rarely visited in the modern world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

Initially, a chamber was believed to be King Khafre's burial chamber, but it is now used for storage during pyramid restoration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. The true resting place, thought to have once held King Khafre's body, was also explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Graffiti by the tomb's discoverer, dating to 1818, is present inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. A guide jokingly warned against a curse for disturbing the tomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## Pyramid of Menkaure

The Pyramid of Menkaure still features some original granite at its base from 4,600 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. A climber was granted special permission to ascend the pyramid, an act normally illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

### Interior Features
The pyramid's initial descent leads down a shaft over a hundred feet below ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **Decorative Carvings** This pyramid contains the very first chamber in [[Ancient Egyptian History and Architecture | ancient Egyptian history]] with decorative carvings, known as "false doors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. These carvings are 4,600 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Antechamber** Further into the pyramid is Menkaure's antechamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **Burial Chamber** The pyramid's complex passageways conclude with a final descending shaft to the burial chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, which features a vaulted ceiling designed to relieve weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

### Queen's Pyramids
Adjacent to the Pyramid of Menkaure are three smaller pyramids, which served as tombs for Menkaure's three queens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

## Other Sites Explored

### Tomb of Iymery
This tomb belonged to a high priest, equivalent to a Pope of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. It is illegal for most people to enter to protect its ancient colors, which have survived 4,600 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. The drawings inside illustrate the daily life of Egyptians, including the process of making and bottling wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

### Tomb of Osiris
Described as a "portal to the underworld," the Tomb of Osiris is located deep underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Very few humans have ever been inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Dangers** The descent is dangerous, with a risk of death from falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, and potential unconsciousness due to lack of oxygen at deeper levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Contents** Inside, ancient human remains, including a skull, were found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The sarcophagus of God Osiris is located in the center of the room, believed to be the gateway to the underworld <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. An unexplored shaft also extends from this chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### Workman's Tomb
The Workman's Tomb is the burial site of the pyramid builders, dating back over 4,600 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. Unlike other [[Egyptian Burial Sites and Practices | tombs]], these lack elaborate paintings, indicating the builders' lower economic status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.
*   **Skeletons** Skeletons of men and women were found in their exact original locations from 4,600 years ago, not having been moved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. Analysis of these skeletons revealed stress on their backs, attributed to moving two-ton blocks during pyramid construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. This physical evidence supports the theory that Egyptians, not aliens, built the pyramids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

### The Great Sphinx of Giza
The Sphinx, a massive half-human, half-lion sculpture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>, was explored with Dr. Zahi, who refuted [[Myths and Theories About the Pyramids | online conspiracy theories]] about a buried temple filled with gold beneath it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. An empty hole was found inside, confirming Dr. Zahi's claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. A letter and a gold item were buried inside the Sphinx to leave a message for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

## Pyramid Construction Theories
Throughout the exploration, various theories regarding pyramid construction were addressed:
*   Some attribute the advanced technology to a pre-Egyptian civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   More extreme theories suggest extraterrestrial involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
*   However, Egyptologists are confident that the pyramids were built by the first Egyptians as tombs for their kings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This is supported by evidence such as the stress injuries on the skeletons of the pyramid builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>, and ancient graffiti confirming the identity of the Egyptian work teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.

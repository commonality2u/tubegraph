From: [[mrbeast]] <br/> 

In a "going back to school" challenge, contestants face elimination and punishment for failing school tests. The primary rule for failing a test is missing more than two questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Consequences of Failure

### Elimination from the Challenge
When a contestant fails a test, they are eliminated from the primary competition and do not proceed to the next grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This continues until only one person remains, or everyone makes it to 12th grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

### Physical Punishment
Failing a test results in the contestant being "pelted by water balloons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This punishment is applied immediately after the results are announced for the failed individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Some participants noted the pain, with one mentioning the balloons "felt like a baseball" and caused welts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

### Personal Reactions to Failure
The challenge's [[High Stakes Challenges | high stakes]] and the public nature of the tests lead to various reactions from those who fail:

*   **Chandler (Second Grade Fail):** Initially attempts to claim he failed on purpose to be funny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, but his fellow contestants playfully call him "dumb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The teacher declares him "the weakest link" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Garrett (Fifth Grade Fail):** Expresses disappointment but pride in reaching fifth grade, which was further than he expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. He also ironically states that the water reminds him of being on his dad's yacht <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Ethan (Fifth Grade Fail):** No verbal reaction is noted from Ethan, who scored a 10% on the fifth-grade test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Jimmy (Seventh Grade Fail):** Acknowledges that he only failed due to spelling, which he knew he was bad at, and predicted it would eventually lead to his elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. He also uses the moment to plug merchandise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
*   **Chris (Eleventh Grade Fail):** MrBeast explicitly states Chris failed 11th grade, leading to his punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. Chris states he "didn't take either chemistry or economics" (the subjects on the test) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.
*   **MrBeast (Fifth Grade Pre-Test):** Before the fifth-grade test, MrBeast expresses anxiety, stating "I'm 100% failing this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. He successfully passes this test despite his worries.

## The Ultimate Outcome
The challenge offers a $10,000 prize. If only one person makes it to the final grade (12th grade), they win the entire amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. If all contestants pass every grade, they all split the prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Ultimately, Bailey is the last contestant to successfully complete all grades and wins the $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. He plans to use the money to pay off "real school debt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a> from studying editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.

This article explores various private islands, detailing their prices and unique features, ranging from the cheapest to the most luxurious.

## The $1 Private Island
This island, purchased for a single dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, was significantly smaller than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Its features included a random pile of bricks, an old toilet, and numerous random wooden poles (referred to as pylons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. There were more pylons than square feet on the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, and it was noted that there was "nothing here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Monkey Island: The $1 Million Illusion
Known as Monkey Island, this location cost $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a> and is literally swarmed with hundreds of monkeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. These monkeys have a unique strategy: they "gaslight" people into friendship before stealing their food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The island offers six luxury cabanas suspended above the water, housing both humans and monkeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

Interestingly, this "island" is not truly an island but rather the top of a massive underwater plant network that emerged from the sand and water, creating an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Amenities include a private relaxation area and a beachfront massage parlor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## The $5 Million Frozen Wonderland
Priced at $5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, this island is notable for its extreme cold, with the surrounding lake often frozen solid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Access is uniquely via hovercrafts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, as snowmobiles were deemed "too basic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

For warmth, the island features futuristic self-heating huts that can both float on warm lake water during warmer months and withstand the dead of winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. In winter, guests can enjoy a great view of the northern lights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. It's described as a winter wonderland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, offering unlimited five-star food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a> and a luxury cabin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Activities include dog sledding on the frozen lake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## The $16 Million Luxury Island
This island, costing $16 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, is described as tiny but arguably one of the most luxurious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Its amenities include a reasonable-sized shower (unlike those in typical luxury homes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. For transport and leisure, it provides a helicopter (though seemingly too large for the island) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, jet skis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, and multiple submarines, including a shark submarine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Extreme activities like jumping out of a helicopter into the ocean are also offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Royal Island: The $45 Million Retreat
This massive island, priced at $45 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>, is so large it cannot be fully captured in a single frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. It features a mansion, a beachside bar, and a private chef <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Outside, there's a hot tub overlooking a cove with jet skis, and a pool with an incredible view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. For additional accommodation, there are five luxury beachside cabanas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

Beyond its amenities, the island is special for its century-old ruins, which were once a village over a hundred years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Exploring these ruins requires off-roading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

## The $150 Million Luxury Island (Necker Island)
This island, costing $150 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, is one of the most expensive and luxurious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. It boasts eight luxurious mega mansions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a> and is completely powered by solar panels and wind turbines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. It took over four decades to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

These animals were brought by the owner, [[Richard Branson]], to prevent them from going extinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

For guests, there are personal drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>, and for every one guest, there are ten staff members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. The "Great House" has a driving range on the roof where golf balls made of fish food can be hit into the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

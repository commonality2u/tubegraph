A volunteer undertook a 50-hour challenge of [[challenges_of_isolation_and_confinement | solitary confinement]] in a purpose-built room, facing various physical and psychological tests orchestrated by his friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The challenge extended beyond a typical 24-hour duration to push the participant's limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The objective for the friends was to make the participant leave early, as his success would result in them getting slimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Living Conditions and Initial Setup
The room for the challenge was equipped with a one-way mirror, allowing external observers to see in but not the participant to see out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. A TV inside the room was controlled externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The door was securely locked, preventing the participant from leaving voluntarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Psychological and Sensory Challenges

### Noise Torture and Lack of Quiet
One of the primary [[challenges_of_isolation_and_lack_of_stimulation | challenges of isolation and lack of stimulation]] involved relentless audio harassment:
*   Playing the participant's own old videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   Annoying sounds, including retching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, Minecraft cat noises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, and a repetitive phrase, "Are You Going to Finish That Croissant?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, which made the participant feel like they were "in hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   Playing 10 hours of Patrick sleeping sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   Loud metal music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a> and phone buzzing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, including an iPhone alarm on repeat for over an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. The participant noted this was "a lot harder than I thought" and that they were "kind of going crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   Screaming goat sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   A custom rap song played repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   Multiple alarm clocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a> and a siren <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   Luigi screaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   A leaf blower used to clear out the room's smell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.

### Sleep Deprivation
The friends actively tried to prevent the participant from sleeping, understanding that lack of rest would be a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Boredom and Mental State
Despite the constant harassment, boredom was a significant factor, with the participant stating they were "bored and I still have 42 hours left" after only eight hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. The participant initially felt scared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, and later admitted to "going crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, though by the end, they found it wasn't "as hard as I thought it would be," only going "slightly crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

### [[Impact_of_Solitary_Confinement_on_Perception_of_Time | Impact of Solitary Confinement on Perception of Time]]
The participant's sense of time was distorted, as his external timer was removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. At one point, he believed he had four hours left when only 43 minutes remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

## [[Coping_Mechanisms_in_Solitary_Confinement | Coping Mechanisms in Solitary Confinement]]
To combat the [[challenges_of_living_in_isolation | challenges of living in isolation]] and the attempts to break his resolve, the participant devised several strategies:
*   **Physical Resistance:** He used a chair and a camera tripod to smash the internal speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, noting the relief of silence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Obstructing Surveillance:** He implemented a three-part plan to block visibility: blocking the door, covering the one-way mirror, and reorienting cameras to face the corner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. He even dismantled parts of the bed to aid in this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **Strategic Acquisition:** He tricked his friends into providing a ladder, which he used to remove external speakers that were dropped into the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Ignoring Provocations:** He attempted to ignore the noise and antics, believing his friends would eventually get bored if he didn't react <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. He hid under a blanket for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Seeking Comfort:** Despite the challenges, he appreciated unexpected comforts, such as a filet mignon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, lasagna and chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, and a cake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Support:** A video message from Drake Bell, intended to make him leave, backfired by encouraging him to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   **Maintaining Composure:** Towards the end, despite the [[psychological_effects_of_longterm_confinement | psychological effects of longterm confinement]], he stated that the experience wasn't as difficult as anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

## Conclusion
The participant successfully endured 50 hours of [[challenges_of isolation | isolation]] and continuous attempts at psychological torture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. Despite the discomfort, lack of sleep, and sensory overload, he completed the challenge, leading to his friends getting slimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. He acknowledged the difficulty, particularly the iPhone alarm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>, but ultimately prevailed.

## Team-Based Pressure
In a departure from individual [[High stakes challenge strategies | high stakes challenges]], a group of five contestants faced a $200,000 prize, to be split among them if *any* one of them could make a half-court basketball shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. This created a [[Competitive teamwork | competitive teamwork]] environment where each participant's success or failure directly impacted the others, leading to increased shared pressure and encouragement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

The culmination of the [[Competitive strategy and teamwork | competitive strategy and teamwork]] was seen in the final contestant's attempt, where the pressure was palpable, and his successful shot resulted in widespread celebration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

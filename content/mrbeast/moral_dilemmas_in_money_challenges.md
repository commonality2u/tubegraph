Challenges that involve significant monetary rewards can often present participants with complex ethical decisions, particularly when the outcome affects others.

## The "Steal or Split" Challenge

One direct instance of a moral dilemma involved a challenge where a contestant, Marcus, was presented with $40,000 [00:06:06]. He had two options:
1.  **Steal**: Keep the entire $40,000 for himself [00:06:08].
2.  **Split**: Divide the money with a random person he would never meet [00:06:12].

Adding a layer of ethical tension, the person who had previously lost money in a similar challenge was brought back to observe Marcus's decision [00:06:14]. When asked what the observer would pick, the answer was "Steal" [00:06:24].

Marcus chose to steal the money without hesitation [00:06:29]. This outcome was described as "painful" and "so messed up" by observers [00:06:35]. The person who lost out on the money was seen "looking at the camera" [00:06:37] and later "taking pictures right now with Chris" [00:06:52], highlighting the direct impact of the decision. The host wondered if they would "keep going until someone actually splits it" [00:06:56], suggesting a preference for an altruistic outcome.

> While many challenges involve [[moneybased_competitions_and_incentives | incentives]] and [[challenge_to_win_money | opportunities to win money]], such as retrieving cash from sharks [00:00:08], enduring extreme temperatures [00:01:06], or navigating dangerous obstacles like a glass bridge [00:01:28] or a slack line over a canyon [00:03:51], these primarily focus on [[risk_versus_reward_challenges | risk versus reward]], physical endurance, or skill rather than explicit moral choices for the participant. The host also offers assistance in some challenges, such as providing answers for the glass bridge, but this is a host-driven action rather than a participant's moral dilemma [00:01:52].

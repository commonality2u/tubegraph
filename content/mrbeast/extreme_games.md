An "Extreme Game" of tag was organized by Jimmy (MrBeast), offering a grand prize of $500,000 in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This [[highstakes_physical_challenges | high-stakes physical challenge]] took place in a massive stadium capable of accommodating over 160,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The contestants were finalists from a previous video, having earned their spot by sitting in a circle for 12 consecutive days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Gameplay and Challenges

The game began with contestants attempting to hide throughout the enormous stadium, while Jimmy searched for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The initial phase was likened more to hide-and-seek due to the vastness of the location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. After hours of searching with little success, Jimmy enlisted the help of Chris and Chandler to assist in tagging contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### Participant Incentives

As contestants were tagged out, they received a consolation prize of $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. For example, Jordan and Chris each received $10,000 after being tagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Participants also engaged in [[creative_stunts_and_highrisk_video_challenges | creative stunts]], such as flipping a golf cart, which was deemed "funny content" by Jimmy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

### Rule Adjustments and Escalation

The game continued for over 20 hours, leading to significant [[mental_and_physical_strain_in_extreme_conditions | mental and physical strain]] for the contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. To expedite the process, Jimmy made several drastic changes:
*   **New Chasers:** Chris and Chandler were replaced by SapNap and Carl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **GPS Activation:** Jimmy activated GPS trackers on all contestants' phones to locate them more easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Despite this, a ten-second delay in the tracker still made catching people difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Stadium Shrink:** With only seven people remaining after nearly 20 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, the playable area was drastically reduced to just the racetrack within the stadium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. This transformed the game into "full on tag" with no hiding allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Contestants were given 10 minutes to reach the racetrack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

## The Finals

The game progressed through various stages, with participants being tagged out. When only three contestants remained, the third-place finisher received $20,000 as a consolation prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. The final two contestants, Lincoln and Andy, had endured 12 days in a circle and 24 hours of running from the chasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

The ultimate winner of this [[extreme_challenges_for_subscribers | extreme challenge]] was Lincoln <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. He received the grand prize of $500,000, presented in one-dollar bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. In addition to the cash, Lincoln also won a brand new car and an extra $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

A particular challenge involved searching for a specific individual anywhere in the world within 48 hours to win $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The target was described as an "old man with a Hawaiian shirt, shorts, and these shoes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This [[high_stakes_challenges | high-stakes challenge]] provided a clear [[incentives_and_motivations_in_challenges | incentive]] for success.

## Early Challenges and Setbacks

The participant initially traveled to Cabo, believing it to be an ideal location to find the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Upon arrival, the participant rented a boat and observed several old men, but none matched the exact criteria, specifically lacking the Hawaiian shirts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Many individuals encountered were "almost there" but were missing "one feature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. These "near misses" highlighted the difficulty of the search and were early instances of [[unexpected_events_and_complications_during_the_challenge | unexpected complications]].

## Unexpected Rejection and Adaptive Strategy

After hours of searching, an [[unexpected_encounters_during_the_challenge | unexpected encounter]] occurred when a "perfect match" was finally found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. However, this individual "said he didn't want to" participate, an unforeseen rejection that created a significant setback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. In response, the participant devised a new plan: purchasing ten Hawaiian shirts to leave out, hoping people would start wearing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## A Last-Minute Breakthrough

As the 48-hour deadline approached, with only two hours remaining, the participant began to feel defeated, thinking the challenge "might not be possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. However, in a dramatic twist of events, with only an hour left, the exact target individual was found "sitting in the lobby" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This last-minute discovery was a significant [[impact_of_surprises_and_moral_lessons_in_competitions | surprise]] and led to the successful completion of the challenge.

## Prize Allocation

The individual found was informed they had won $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Following the win, a lighthearted suggestion was made to "go on a helicopter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The [[winning_and_allocation_of_prize_money_in_challenges | prize money was allocated]] to the unexpected winner.

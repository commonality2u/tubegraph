Contestants in a series of [[dangerous escape room challenges | dangerous escape room]] levels faced a strict one-hour time limit to win $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The timer continued to tick down through all 10 levels, forcing participants to find the exit in each stage before time ran out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Level 1: Spikes and Sand

The first level presented a room with walls closing in, featuring spikes that threatened to impale the contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The challenge required them to break through a brick wall using tools to escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Level 2: The Key Hunt

In the second level, participants were tasked with finding a key hidden somewhere in the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Adding to the urgency, the $100,000 prize money was placed on a conveyor belt, set to be dumped into a fire if not retrieved within 55 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The key was eventually found after extensive searching and a boost to reach a high shelf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Level 3: Minecraft Challenge

The third level featured a Minecraft-themed room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The exit was linked to a TNT block embedded in the wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Based on Minecraft mechanics, the solution involved lighting the TNT block with a flaming arrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. After a failed attempt to shoot the arrow, the TNT was lit by manually jamming the arrow into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Level 4: The Misleading Dig

Upon entering level four, contestants were presented with a scenario suggesting they needed to dig out a key from the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. However, this was a trick; the door was actually unlocked and they could leave at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. After wasting significant time digging, a hint was provided to "just open the door," leading to the realization of the simple solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This highlighted a form of [[game show style decision making | game show style decision making]] where the hosts can influence the outcome.

## Level 5 & 6: Trick Hotel and Snakes

The next stage was a "trick hotel" designed in collaboration with Zach King, featuring numerous rooms and secret hallways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Chris quickly found a secret entrance by kicking down a fake brick wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This led to a room filled with snakes, including one 18 feet long and weighing 200 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. The exit required one person to stand on a pressure plate to keep the door open for the others, forcing a sacrifice via "rock, paper, scissors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. This scenario demonstrated elements of [[teamwork and problem solving | teamwork and problem solving]] under pressure.

## Level 7: Chocolate Bar Ticket

In level seven, participants faced thousands of chocolate bars, with only one containing a mystery ticket needed to exit the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This challenge was intertwined with a promotion for Feastables chocolate bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. The ticket was eventually found, allowing them to advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Level 8: The Library Book

Level eight was a massive library containing over 1,000 books, but only one would open a trap door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. With only 19 minutes remaining, a hint was offered to burn $5,000 of the prize money in exchange for a clue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. After the money was burned, the host pointed in the direction of the correct book, which was an "Elon Musk" biography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Level 9: The Long Walk Back

This level presented a unique time-sensitive challenge, requiring the contestants to retrieve tools from an earlier level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. With less than 13 minutes left, this demanded rapid travel and decision-making to avoid losing more prize money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## Final Level: Lava Bridge

The final level involved crossing a dangerous "lava" bridge to reach the remaining prize money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The challenge involved carefully navigating the unstable path without touching the "lava" below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. The contestant successfully completed this final puzzle with two minutes remaining on the clock, securing the prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

Several [[Challenges for subscribers to win money | challenges]] involve contestants attempting to carry or transport large amounts of cash or valuable items to win them. These challenges often test physical endurance, strategy, and risk assessment.

## As Much Cash as You Can Carry
In one challenge, participants are presented with a "never ending giant mountain of cash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The objective is to carry "as much cash as you can" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, stuffing it into pockets, hoodies, pants, or shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. One participant managed to accumulate $6,751 by stuffing money into their clothes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Filling Bags with Money
Restaurant employees were invited to a warehouse for a [[challenge to win money | challenge]] where they had one minute to fill bags with as much money as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. After the time limit, their boss was also offered a bag of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Duffel Bag Endurance Challenge
Two individuals were tasked with carrying duffel bags, each containing $25,000, for an extended period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Each bag weighed "50 pounds worth of money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The rule was that the first person to set their duffel bag down would lose the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This [[high_stakes_challenges | high-stakes challenge]] continued for at least eight hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Eventually, they engaged in a Sumo wrestling match to decide the winner of the $25,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

## Laser Obstacle Course with Money
A participant, Nolan, attempted to navigate a laser obstacle course while carrying money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. At the end of the course were keys to a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The rule for this [[risk_versus_reward_challenges | risk-versus-reward challenge]] was that if he touched a laser or dropped a dollar, he would lose all his money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Nolan ultimately dropped his money, losing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

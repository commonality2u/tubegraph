During a 50-hour survival challenge in Antarctica, one of the primary objectives was to trek towards mountains for wind protection and to establish "Camp Beast" at the base of a mountain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. As the challenge progressed, an unnamed mountain presented itself as an opportunity for an adventurous climb.

## The Decision to Climb
Jimmy identified an unnamed mountain and proposed climbing it to earn the right to name it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Nolan was recruited to join the climb, mainly so Jimmy would have someone hooked to him in case he fell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## [[Hiking difficulties and challenges | Challenges of the Ascent]]
The journey to and up the mountain was fraught with [[Hiking difficulties and challenges | challenges]]:
*   **Initial Obstacles** The first obstacle encountered was a "sea of ice," described as very slippery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Extreme Terrain** The climb involved navigating treacherous terrain with drops, including a significant cliff where a fall would be fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Jimmy expressed being "terrified" by the height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **[[Overcoming fear of heights | Fear and Difficulty]]** Both climbers found the experience terrifying, noting they were "so high right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Jimmy stated it was "by far the hardest thing we've ever done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> and "the most terrifying experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Physical Exertion** The climb was physically demanding, with Jimmy grunting and requiring frequent breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

The view from the mountain was described as feeling like being on "a different planet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## Reaching the Summit and Naming the Mountain
After approximately four and a half hours, Jimmy and Nolan successfully reached the summit of the unnamed mountain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. This marked a significant [[Celebrating milestones during extreme challenges | milestone]] in their challenge, and they celebrated not dying during the climb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

Upon conquering the mountain, Jimmy declared its new name to be "Shopify Mountain," in acknowledgment of the platform's role in powering his YouTube channel into a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

From the summit, their base camp appeared as "tiny little specks" over 10 miles away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## The Descent and Return to Camp
The journey down the mountain was also a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. In line with [[Responsible hiking practices | responsible hiking practices]] in Antarctica, they had to ensure nothing was left behind, including a flag they had carried up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

Jimmy and Nolan returned to Camp Beast at 4:00 AM, exhausted from the climb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Jimmy described the climb as "the hardest thing I've ever done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

One of the most exciting segments in MrBeast videos is the inclusion of physically demanding challenges where contestants can earn substantial cash prizes. These challenges not only test participants' physical endurance but also offer them a chance to win life-changing amounts of money. Here, we delve into some of the physical challenges featured in MrBeast's latest video. 

## The Pull-Up Bar Challenge
In the video, MrBeast introduces a challenge in which a contestant can earn $100 for every second they hang from a pull-up bar. This simple yet physically demanding task offers a substantial reward if the contestant can endure. For instance, if someone manages to hang for 10 minutes, they walk away with $60,000. In this video, a participant named David successfully managed to hang on for 2 minutes and 25 seconds, thereby winning $15,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This challenge highlights the potential for quick earnings based on physical endurance and involves strategies for endurance competitions [[strategies_for_endurance_competitions]].

## Painted Dodgeball with Karl 
Another unique physical challenge involved throwing dodge balls covered in paint at Karl, one of the crew members. Each successful hit scored the contestant $1,000. It was a test of aim and physical coordination, attracting eager participants ready to earn some fast cash. Over the course of the challenge, the contestants managed to hit Karl multiple times, racking up their own winnings in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

Participants had three throws to try their luck and skill, aiming for the best prize they could reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

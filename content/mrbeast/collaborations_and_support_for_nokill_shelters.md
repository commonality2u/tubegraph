In a significant effort to find homes for shelter dogs, a comprehensive campaign was launched involving extensive marketing and direct support for adopters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The primary goal was to ensure every dog at the shelter found a loving home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Campaign Strategy and Marketing Efforts

The campaign focused on generating high visibility and interest in the adoptable dogs.
Key [[impact_of_marketing_campaigns_for_pet_adoption | marketing strategies]] included:

*   **Billboards:** Initially, one billboard was purchased to direct traffic to the shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. When adoptions slowed, an additional 50 billboards were bought and displayed around town <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Flyers:** Flyers were created and hung up throughout the town <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Box Truck:** A large box truck was used to promote dog adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Professional Photography:** Professional photos of all the dogs were taken to use in new marketing designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **Radio Interview:** A friend, Ethan, conducted a radio interview to encourage people to adopt dogs for genuine reasons, rather than solely due to the involvement of the "Beast Crew" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Costumed Mascot:** Someone dressed in a dog costume ("Puddles") held a "Cute Doggos Inside" sign outside the shelter to attract attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

A "command center" was established to monitor cameras and track the effectiveness of the billboard campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The marketing efforts proved highly effective, bringing in multiple families simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

## Incentives for Adopters

To further encourage [[dog_adoption_efforts_at_a_shelter | dog adoption]], significant financial incentives and gifts were provided to new pet parents:

*   **10 Years of Free Dog Food:** The first adopter received 10 years' worth of dog food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Cash Incentives:** Some adopters received $5,000 as a thank you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Waived Adoption Fees:** Adoption fees, which were $275, were waived for many adopters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **Petco Gift Cards:** Adopters were given large Petco gift cards, some up to $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
*   **Pet Insurance:** Some adopters received 10 years of pet insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   **Unlimited Supplies:** Adopters were also given unlimited dog food and toys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

## Dog Adoption Process and Shelter Support

The shelter ensured that every person adopting a dog was properly vetted, including filling out applications and other necessary procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. The staff at the shelter formed strong bonds with the dogs, showing emotion when a long-term resident like Gia, who had been at the shelter for six months, found a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

After adoption hours, the remaining dogs were taken to a pet store where they were allowed to pick out any toys they wanted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. The next morning, the dogs were given a special gourmet breakfast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

Ultimately, every dog at the shelter was adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. The last dog, Pinky, was adopted by Maddy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

## Partnership with Furkids No-Kill Shelter

The initiative was a collaboration with Furkids, a no-kill shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. According to Darren from Furkids, the support received was "an absolute miracle," something unprecedented in their 19-year history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. Furkids is committed to the genuine care of dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

### Future Support

Donations to Furkids are encouraged to help them build a bigger facility capable of assisting thousands more dogs in need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

A former missile silo, originally built in the 1950s to withstand a nuclear strike, was abandoned in the 1960s before being transformed into a 14-story luxury underground bunker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Its purpose is to provide "a cool place to stay if the world ended" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Security Measures
The bunker's [[security_measures_in_luxury_bunkers | security measures in luxury bunkers]] are extensive, designed to keep occupants safe in extreme scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>:
*   **Entry Doors**: The entrance features multiple thick doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The first door alone weighs 16,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Visitors pass through a total of four doors before reaching the main facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Surveillance**: The facility is monitored 24/7 with top-of-the-line surveillance equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Structural Integrity**: Each residential floor is protected by nine-foot-thick walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

## Interior and Amenities
The 14-story underground bunker offers a wide range of luxury amenities and facilities designed to support [[living_conditions_in_extended_isolation | living conditions in extended isolation]] in a comfortable manner:
*   **Residential Units**: Individual condos on floors like number 11 cost between one and two and a half million dollars, capable of supporting up to 10 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. These units include features like "windows" that are actually screens displaying video of the outside world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   **Recreation**:
    *   Pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
    *   Movie theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>
    *   Gym and sauna, designed to help occupants [[living_conditions_in_extended_isolation | stay fit]] during potential long-term stays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
    *   Game areas with a pool table and chessboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
    *   Ping pong table and a climbing wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   **Education & Library**: The bunker includes an educational area and a library <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## Self-Sufficiency and Food Production
A key aspect of [[living_in_a_nuclear_bunker_for_100_days | living in a nuclear bunker for 100 days]] or longer is [[selfsustaining_agriculture_in_bunkers | selfsustaining agriculture in bunkers]]. The bunker has advanced systems for food production:
*   **Storage**: Food storage includes items like 47 servings of apples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a> and scrambled eggs in a can <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Hydroponics & Aquaculture**: There is an underground "fish market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a> and a designated area for growing plants, where they "literally grow everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
    *   This system operates on an aquaponics model: fish waste is used to grow plants, and the plants in turn provide food for the fish, creating a [[selfsustaining_agriculture_in_bunkers | self-sustaining]] food cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Pre-harvested fish are also stored for cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

## Experience of Isolation
Despite being 11 stories deep underground, the bunker feels like a normal house due to its amenities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Occupants report sleeping well, even suggesting it's "10 times better" than sleeping outside a bunker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. However, upon exiting, the sunlight can be overwhelmingly bright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

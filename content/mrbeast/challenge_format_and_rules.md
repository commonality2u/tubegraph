This [[mr_beast_challenge_setup_and_rules | Mr. Beast challenge]] pits 100 kids against 100 adults, each group confined within a massive cube, in a test of endurance and strategy to win a significant cash prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This specific [[unique_contest_formats | contest format]] features a prolonged [[isolation_challenge_rules_and_setup | isolation challenge]] lasting 100 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Core Objective and Prize

The primary goal for each team is to retain the most people inside their cube after 100 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The winning cube's remaining players split half a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This makes it a [[highstakes_game_show_formats | high-stakes game show format]] where every remaining participant directly benefits from their team's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Initial Setup and Rules

*   **Confinement**: Participants are sealed inside their respective cubes with doors closed from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   **Parental Agreement**: If the kids' team wins, their parents must sign a paper agreeing that the children can spend the money responsibly and that the parents will not use it on themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This is part of the broader [[game_show_agreements_and_rules | game show agreements and rules]].

## Elimination Mechanics and Incentives

Throughout the challenge, various [[creative_rules_for_winning_prizes | creative rules]] and incentives are introduced to encourage participants to leave:

*   **Early Exit Offer**: One hour into the challenge, participants are offered $1,000 to leave within 60 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This is explicitly stated as the only time anyone will receive money unless they win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. After this initial offer, 12 adults and 10 kids were eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Food-Based Temptations**:
    *   Serving unappetizing oatmeal is used to try and get people to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
    *   An offer of Taco Bell for the kids' team is made if two participants leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
    *   The adults' team is offered 75 cups of coffee if two of them leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
    *   Later, a proposal is made to the kids: shrink their square in exchange for individual pizzas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. The adults eventually accept this offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Shrinking Zone Button**: A critical [[unique_competition_formats | competition format]] element involves a giant button in front of each cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
    *   At some point within 24 hours, the button turns green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
    *   The first team to press the green button shrinks the other team's zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
    *   The color of the button can be changed to blue by the hosts to trick participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **"Empty Briefcase" Prank**: Hosts attempt to trick participants into leaving by showing an empty briefcase, or one with a single dollar bill, implying it contains money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **Balloon Challenge**: Balloons are dropped into the cubes with instructions not to pop them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Popping the balloon results in the team's cube shrinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   **Dividing Lines**: A team leader selects a number between one and five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. This number determines how many dividing lines are added to the opposing team's cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. Stepping over these lines causes elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
*   **Late Game Buyout**: With 30 minutes left, a host offers a participant $5,000 to leave, without Mr. Beast's permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

## Conclusion

At the end of 100 hours, the challenge concludes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. The adults are declared the winners by a landslide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. As a reward for staying, each adult who remained receives an additional $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

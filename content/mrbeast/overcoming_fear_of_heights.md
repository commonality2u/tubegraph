One of the challenges Mack faced to win $800,000 involved confronting his fear of heights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## The Challenge
Mack was blindfolded and led up a ramp to an unknown height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Upon removing the blindfold, he found himself standing high above the ground on the end of a plank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The challenge required him to unclip his harness, disconnecting him from any safety, press a button, and freefall 200 feet, trusting that he would be caught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Mack's Reaction
Despite initially claiming he wasn't afraid of anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, Mack showed clear signs of fear. He was visibly shaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, noting he couldn't even see the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a> and acknowledging he was "very, very high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. He asked for direct reassurance that something would break his fall after unclipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

At one point, with the clip gone and Mack attached to nothing, he was given the option to "tap out" and admit he was scared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Mack refused, stating "No way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, even though he clearly looked scared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## The Outcome
After a suspenseful countdown, Mack pressed the button and completed the freefall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Those observing were amazed, calling him "a psycho" for successfully completing the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

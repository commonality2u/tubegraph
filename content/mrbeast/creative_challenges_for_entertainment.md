The video showcases an elaborate, high-stakes challenge where Mr. Beast (Jimmy) attempts to evade an "assassin" armed with a rubber knife for an entire day to prevent him from winning $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The challenge is designed with multiple phases, incorporating various [[creative_use_of_space_and_props_in_entertainment | creative uses of space and props]], [[creative_stunts_and_highrisk_video_challenges | high-risk video challenges]], and [[creative_problemsolving_in_extreme_challenges | creative problem-solving]].

## The Core Challenge: Evading the Assassin

The main objective for the assassin is to stab Jimmy with a rubber knife before the end of the day to win $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Jimmy carries a backpack containing the prize money and a tracker, providing the assassin with his real-time location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Phases of the Challenge

### Phase 1: The Initial Escape and Train Yard Ambush
Jimmy begins by leaving a car in the woods for the assassin to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. His first hiding spot is a massive warehouse filled with dozens of train cars, making it difficult to find him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

A major twist in this phase involves a [[creative_stunts_and_highrisk_video_challenges | high-risk stunt]]:
*   **Tank Deployment**: Jimmy arranges for Chris to operate a real tank and destroy the assassin's car once they are inside the warehouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This forces the assassin to seek new transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, either by Uber or purchasing a new vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Escape Vehicle**: Jimmy's team escapes in a pre-arranged getaway car from inside the warehouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Phase 2: The Hotel Hideout
Jimmy rents every room in an entire hotel as a hiding place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. He sets up over a hundred cameras to monitor the hotel's every inch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Misdirection**: Jimmy hides in one of over 200 rooms and places "a little something" in every room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **[[creative_elimination_tactics | Creative Elimination Tactic]]**: To slow down the assassin, Jimmy offers a hint to his location in exchange for tying up his companions, Chandler and Karl, in a specific room (1802) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **Secret Exit**: Jimmy's escape from the 20th floor involves a secret wall concealing an elevator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, leading to a waiting Lamborghini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

### Phase 3: The Bank Vault Challenge
Jimmy's next location is a bank, where he hides in a double-reinforced steel bank vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   **Vault Trap**: Jimmy reveals there are two bank vaults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. The assassin picks the "easy one" and becomes trapped with Nolan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, while Jimmy is in the other.
*   **Mobile Vault**: In a display of [[creative_stunts_and_highrisk_video_challenges | high-risk video challenges]], Jimmy arranges for the entire bank vault containing the assassin and Nolan to be extracted through a brick wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a> and transported ten miles down the road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. The bank is then blown up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

### Phase 4: The Carnival and Fake Injury
For the final location, Jimmy builds an entire carnival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Deception**: This elaborate carnival is a distraction while Jimmy attempts a [[creative_approaches_in_winning_prizes | creative approach]] to avoid being stabbed â€“ faking a serious ankle injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Hidden spy cameras from afar record the interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

## Outcome
Despite Jimmy's elaborate ruse, the assassin sees through the fake injury due to an incorrect splinting technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. With less than 20 minutes remaining in the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, the assassin ultimately stabs Jimmy with the rubber knife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, winning the $100,000 prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

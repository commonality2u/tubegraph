In a large-scale hide-and-seek style challenge set within one of the world's largest malls, the hunt for 100 contestants each given $10,000 escalated with the introduction of specialized teams and advanced technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The objective for the hunters was to reclaim the $10,000 from each contestant they found within a 10-hour timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## SWAT Team Deployment

After three hours of searching and only finding seven people, the primary hunter realized he needed significant backup due to the massive size of the mall and the large sum of money ($930,000) still at stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

A SWAT team was scheduled to arrive at 5:00 AM to assist in the hunt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. To highly motivate the team, a significant incentive was offered: for every person the SWAT team found, they would be allowed to keep half of the $10,000 prize money that was recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

> [!info] Tactics and Effectiveness
> The SWAT team approached the [[bounty_hunting_challenges_and_strategies | bounty hunting challenge]] with military precision, planning to "circle around the whole mall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. They utilized professional radio communication for coordination and efficient area clearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Their effectiveness was immediate and remarkable, as they found 10 people much faster than the challenge host had managed to find two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. The host noted that "This SWAT team does not mess around" and jokingly referred to them as the "SWAT team that crushed my dreams" due to their rapid success in recovering funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Thermal Drone Technology

Integrated with the SWAT team's operations was the use of advanced technology, specifically a thermal drone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. The drone operator used it to scan the mall area from above and call out the locations of hidden individuals to the ground teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

> [!tip] Practical Application
> The thermal drone proved highly effective in identifying hiding spots that might have been otherwise overlooked. For instance, the drone detected two contestants hidden "behind by the brown mat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. One contestant, who had been hiding under stairs for about five hours, expressed surprise upon realizing a drone was flying directly above their head, highlighting the invasiveness of the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

Despite the drone's advanced capabilities, it was not infallible. One contestant successfully evaded detection by the drone while hiding in a theme park section of the mall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## Overall Impact

The deployment of the SWAT team and thermal drone significantly intensified the [[high_stakes_challenge_strategies | high stakes challenge]]. While highly effective in recovering a substantial amount of money quickly, the vastness of the mall meant that even with such advanced resources, a significant number of contestants remained hidden as the challenge continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. This showcased how professional [[bounty_hunting_challenges_and_strategies | bounty hunting strategies]] and modern [[using_tools_like_metal_detectors_in_challenges | tools]] can be adapted for large-scale, unconventional challenges.

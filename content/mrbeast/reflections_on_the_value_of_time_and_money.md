The "100 Days in a Circle" challenge offered a participant, Shawn, $500,000 for staying within a laid-out circle for 100 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This unique premise provided a direct scenario to observe the [[moral_dilemmas_in_money_challenges | trade-offs between monetary reward and personal sacrifice]].

## The Initial Commitment and Perspective
Shawn, a random subscriber, stepped into the circle, initiating the 100-day countdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Before beginning, he shared a final goodbye with his family, stating, "No pain no gain, dad. You guys will be here when I walk out of that circle with a half million dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. He expressed that walking out of the circle prematurely would lead to eternal regret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Shawn's motivation for the prize money included putting his farm "100% on solar power" to make it "like a giant Tesla," and taking a "nice vacation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. He also aimed to get "ripped and $500,000 richer" by the end of the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## The Cost of Isolation: Time, Family, and Mental Well-being
As the challenge progressed, the value of time, especially time with family, became a significant theme. Shawn noted that the competition was a "huge sacrifice," lamenting that he only gets "so many summers with [his] kids... before they're gone and out of the house" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Being alone for the longest time in 18 years, with four kids and a wife, made the loneliness the hardest part of the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This emotional toll was evident on Father's Day, Day 39, when he missed his family greatly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. A surprise visit from his family provided much-needed emotional relief, though he noted it must be nice for them to be able to "walk out of the red circle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

Shawn also faced physical and logistical challenges, including issues with his shower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, a leaky roof during a tornado watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, and rationing his food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. After 30 days of isolation, he had lost 22 pounds and described himself as "seriously shaking" from the isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

## Temptations and Unwavering Resolve
The challenge organizers repeatedly tested Shawn's resolve by offering him smaller sums of money to quit.

*   **Day 50:** He was offered $100,000 to leave. Shawn refused, stating, "Why 100 grand? I can just chill here and get another 400" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. He indicated that he would only consider leaving for "above 400" thousand dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **Nine Days Left:** With only nine days remaining, Shawn was offered $250,000 to leave. Despite the extreme heat and physical discomfort, he again refused, declaring, "I think I'd rather die than give up on this challenge at this point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

## [[Final thoughts and reflections on the experience | Final Reflections]]
On the last day, as the timer wound down, Shawn reflected on the broader implications of his sacrifice:

> "Money's the thing we trade our life for. Giving up a third of a year of my life for a half million? Make sure you're trading your life for things that are worth it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>

Upon completing the 100 days and receiving his $500,000 check, Shawn expressed relief: "I am glad it's over, though" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. The challenge served as a stark illustration of the personal value placed on time, comfort, and human connection when directly weighed against a significant financial reward.

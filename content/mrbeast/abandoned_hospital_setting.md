The primary location for a hide-and-seek challenge, where participants competed for a $100,000 cash prize, was an expansive abandoned hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This formidable setting provided numerous opportunities for concealment and evasion due to its sheer size and dilapidated state.

## Scale and Features

The abandoned hospital is described as a massive complex featuring:
*   Over 100 different rooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.
*   Six different buildings surrounding the main structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.
*   A cafeteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   Multiple roofs and accessible stairways leading to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   Numerous hidden spots, including under trailers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, under piles of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, and even inside vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   Locked doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, adding to the navigational [[challenges_of_isolation_and_confinement | challenges of isolation]] and pursuit.
*   Bathrooms, which participants occasionally used as temporary hiding spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

## Role in the Game

The extensive nature of the hospital made it an ideal environment for the hide-and-seek format:
*   **Hiding Opportunities**: The sheer number of rooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> and separate buildings allowed participants to spread out and find diverse hiding spots, from rooftops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> to hidden corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **Navigational Complexity**: The vastness of the hospital meant participants often found themselves on "the other side of the hospital" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, making coordination and tracking difficult for the hunters.
*   **Physical Demands**: The continuous running and searching throughout the large property led to exhaustion for both hunters and hiders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Terrain**: The presence of multiple floors, roofs, and exterior areas encouraged participants to use various strategies, including jumping off buildings (onto crash pads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a> and utilizing different access points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

The game also incorporated elements that highlighted the [[surviving_in_an_abandoned_city | challenges of isolation]] within the setting, such as players getting stuck on roofs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a> or being lured into traps within the hospital grounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. The pursuit eventually constricted to "just the hospital" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a> as the numbers of hiders dwindled.

The world of mystery boxes often features unique collaborations and custom-made items, adding an extra layer of surprise and exclusivity for participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These special inclusions can range from personalized goods to custom-filled crates by well-known personalities.

## Custom Sneakers and Personalized Gear

In the $2,500 mystery box, participants received custom-painted sneakers from Sircastle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. These shoes were specifically designed with Super Mario themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a> and featured each person's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. The companies involved were informed in advance to create these personalized items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>, with a note indicating the desire to help individuals express their interests through their footwear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

The $100,000 custom mystery box also showcased a variety of personalized and collector-grade items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. This box contained "HYPEBEAST stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>, including rare SB sneakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>, a Demon Slayer PlayStation 5, a Supreme PlayStation 5, and a standard PlayStation 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.

## Collaborations with Personalities

A unique approach was taken with the $50,000 mystery box, where Dream was given $50,000 to fill the crate with anything he desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. The contents were kept secret, known only to Dream and the mystery box company he collaborated with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>. While initially intended for MrBeast, the crate was ultimately given to one of Dream's fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>, who received a Slingshot car, $10,000 in cash, and a wifi grill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>.

## The World's Largest and Most Expensive Mystery Box

The most significant collaboration involved the $250,000 mystery box, described as the world's largest and most expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. This colossal box was created by MSCHF, a company known for its secretive nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>. Its contents were shipped from various locations across the country over two months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. The ultimate reveal showed a Lamborghini tractor inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>, highlighting Lamborghini's lesser-known origins as a tractor manufacturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>.

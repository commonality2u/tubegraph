The video features a [[challenge_to_win_money | challenge]] to build the world's largest Lego tower, with a [[large_cash_prizes_in_competitive_events | $50,000]] prize for the winning team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The competition spanned 12 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a> and involved heavy-duty machinery to assist with construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Challenge Structure and Rules
Initially, two teams competed, each starting with two members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Chris's partner was Carl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, and Chandler's partner was Tyler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. A key rule was that the winning team's prize money had to be split among its members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Both teams later expanded to four members each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Competition Phases
*   **Initial Build**: Teams began constructing their towers, with a large supply of Lego bricks available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Bowling Ball Attacks**: Throughout the [[challenge_to_win_money | challenge]], participants were subjected to bowling ball throws aimed at their towers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Chandler's team constructed a protective wall that proved effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Mini-Challenge**: A 20-minute mini-challenge was introduced, where the team with the tallest tower at the end would avoid having to "boot" someone off for 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Chris's team's tower measured eight and a half feet, while Chandler's tower was 20 feet and two inches, resulting in Chris's team having to remove Zach for 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Structural Reinforcement**: Chandler's team used concrete to harden the inside of their structure for better stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Team Dynamics**: Chandler's team experienced a significant setback when Chandler left the competition early due to exhaustion, stating that all proceeds would go to his team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Tower Collapse**: Chandler's (now Timmy's) tower fell, reducing its height from 35-40 feet to approximately 15 feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Despite this, the team remained optimistic about rebuilding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

### Final Measurement and Winner
At the end of the 12 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06">[09:06]</a>, a final bowling ball throw was performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Chris's team's tower measured 29 feet and four and a half inches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Timmy's tower (Chandler's original team) measured 29 feet and five and a half inches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>, winning by exactly one Lego block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

## [[winners_and_prizes_distribution | Prize Distribution]] and Allocation
The winning team, consisting of Timmy, Weddle, and Tyler (Chandler having left earlier), split the [[large_cash_prizes_in_competitive_events | $50,000 prize]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. As part of a MrBeast video, the winners had one hour to spend the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

*   **Timmy's Share**: Timmy received approximately $17,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. He used his share to pay off his brother Zach's student loan debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   **Weddle's Share**: Weddle gave $10,000 to his mom, whose work hours were cut, and $4,000 to his little brother Carson, who did not have a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
*   **Tyler's Share**: Tyler used his winnings to secure one year of free rent for his mom, surprising her with the news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

Chandler, who had left the challenge early, was not guaranteed a share, and it was left to the remaining team members to decide if they would give him part of the prize money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

In a [[treasure_hunting_and_teamwork_dynamics | competition]] to find the most [[economic_value_of_discarded_materials | valuable stuff]] by [[strategies_for_finding_valuable_items_in_dumpsters | dumpster diving]] into 100 dumpsters, two contestants, Chris and Weddle, have their retrieved items professionally appraised. The contestant who accrues the highest value wins $12,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## The Appraisers

Initially, a professional appraiser evaluates the items discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Later in the [[treasure_hunting_and_teamwork_dynamics | challenge]], "Chandler 2.0" (Chandler via FaceTime due to an upcoming surgery) also provides appraisals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. At one point, Jimmy, the host, takes over appraisal duties when the professional appraiser is unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

In a series of [[unique_sporting_challenges | unique sporting challenges]], ordinary individuals were given the opportunity to [[competing_against_professional_athletes_for_charity_or_cash | compete against professional athletes]] for substantial cash prizes or charitable donations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. These [[1v1_challenges_featuring_famous_athletes | 1v1 challenges featuring famous athletes]] highlighted both the skill of the professionals and the surprising potential of amateurs.

## Football: Tom Brady vs. Jake
The first challenge pitted legendary quarterback Tom Brady against Jake, a high school football player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The objective was to throw a football at balloons, with the first to pop all four winning $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Due to Tom Brady's seven Super Bowl rings, his balloons were intentionally made smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

Initially, Tom Brady demonstrated his precision, quickly hitting targets from 20 yards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. However, he missed a throw, which was playfully blamed on the rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Jake received support from his high school football team, who cheered him on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The challenge became more difficult at 50 yards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, with the prize money designated for charity if Tom Brady won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. In a surprising turn, Jake landed the final throw, [[winning_strategies_in_competitions | beating]] Tom Brady and securing $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:51">[02:51]</a>.

## Sprinting: Noah Lyles vs. Jonah
The next competition featured Noah Lyles, a triple world champion and Olympic gold medalist recognized as the fastest human on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06">[03:06]</a>. He raced against Jonah, an ordinary person, for $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16">[03:16]</a>. If Noah won, the money would go to charity; if Jonah won, it would be deposited into his bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21">[03:21]</a>.

To give Jonah a chance, a handicap was introduced: a 200-meter race with a head start for Jonah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32">[03:32]</a>. Each 10-meter reduction in distance cost Jonah $10,000 from his prize money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38">[03:38]</a>. Jonah opted for a 60-meter head start, reducing his potential prize to $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00">[04:00]</a>. Despite the significant head start, Noah Lyles easily overtook Jonah, winning the race, and the $40,000 was donated to his chosen charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31">[05:31]</a>. The [[competition_dynamics_in_endurance_challenges | competition dynamics in this endurance challenge]] clearly favored the professional.

## Baseball: Bryce Harper vs. Big Justice
A home run derby challenge saw professional hitter Bryce Harper, a two-time MVP, compete against Big Justice, a Little League player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04">[06:04]</a>. To balance the [[competition dynamics and teamwork | competition]], Big Justice's fence was half the distance of Bryce Harper's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21">[06:21]</a>. The prize was $100,000 for Big Justice or a $100,000 donation to charity if Bryce Harper won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33">[06:33]</a>.

Both competitors had ten swings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52">[06:52]</a>. Bryce Harper hit four home runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59">[07:59]</a>. Big Justice then stepped up, needing five home runs to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18">[08:18]</a>. With only two swings left, Big Justice hit his fifth home run, [[winning_strategies_in_competitions | triumphing]] over Bryce Harper and winning $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46">[09:46]</a>. The [[emotional aspects of competition | emotional dynamics in competitions]] were high, particularly for Big Justice as he secured his win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18">[10:18]</a>.

## Golf: Bryson DeChambeau vs. Aaron
In a golf challenge, two-time major champion Bryson DeChambeau faced Aaron, an amateur golfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34">[10:34]</a>. For this competition, Aaron's hole was made 50 times larger than Bryson's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45">[10:45]</a>. The prize was $100,000 for Aaron, or a $100,000 charity donation if Bryson won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50">[10:50]</a>.

Bryson's first shot landed well, but Aaron's shot went into the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21">[11:21]</a>. However, in an unexpected turn, Bryson's second shot also went into the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21">[12:21]</a>. This incurred a penalty, meaning Bryson would be hitting his third shot next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26">[12:26]</a>. Both players had difficulties, with Bryson missing a putt he claimed he'd make 100 out of 100 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44">[13:44]</a>. Despite the professional's struggle, the challenge eventually led to a tie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03">[15:03]</a>. In a tie-breaker, Aaron hit his ball into the water, while Bryson hit his onto the green, securing the win for charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30">[15:30]</a>.

## Sprinting Rematch: Noah Lyles vs. IShowSpeed
Noah Lyles returned to the racetrack to face IShowSpeed, a content creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15">[16:15]</a>.

The prize was $100,000 for Noah's charity if he won, or $100,000 for one of IShowSpeed's fans if he won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:53">[16:53]</a>. The race was 50 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10">[17:10]</a>.

Initially, IShowSpeed took an early lead, appearing to have a chance at victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30">[17:30]</a>. However, Noah Lyles surged ahead in the final moments, winning the race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42">[17:42]</a>. Despite IShowSpeed's insistence that it was a tie, slow-motion footage confirmed Noah Lyles' win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50">[17:50]</a>. The $100,000 was again donated to Noah Lyles' chosen charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:07">[18:07]</a>.

## Football/Soccer: Cristiano Ronaldo vs. Khalid
The ultimate [[1v1_challenges_featuring_famous_athletes | 1v1 challenge]] pitted football phenomenon Cristiano Ronaldo against Khalid, an ecstatic fan, for a staggering $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41">[18:41]</a>.

In an astonishing turn of events, Khalid scored again, putting him two points ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00">[21:00]</a>. This meant Ronaldo would need to hit all three remaining targets before Khalid hit even one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:07">[21:07]</a>.

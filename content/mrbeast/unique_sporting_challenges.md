The "Beast Olympics," also referred to as the "First Olympics," brought together one person from every country on Earth to compete for a $250,000 gold medal in an "extreme version of the Olympics" [00:00:00]. This event featured several [[highstakes_physical_challenges | high-stakes physical challenges]] with unique twists on traditional sports formats [00:00:08]. Contestants were eliminated through various rounds until only one country remained [00:00:17].

## Competition Format
The competition began with participants representing every country [00:00:00]. Over half the countries were eliminated in the first game, with 97 moving on [00:01:36]. After the second game, 47 countries remained [00:05:45]. This number was further reduced to 16 countries after the archery event [00:09:07].

A unique element of the [[competition_dynamics_in_endurance_challenges | competition dynamics]] involved an offer to contestants before the final rounds: each remaining participant was given a briefcase with $10,000, which they could take and withdraw from the competition, or throw into a pit to continue competing for the gold medal [00:09:21]. Most chose to continue, with only Fiji and Italy accepting the $10,000 and withdrawing [00:09:59].

## Events

### Track
The first event was a modified track challenge [00:00:11].
> [!NOTE] Challenge Details
> Contestants had 30 seconds to get across three hurdles that progressively got bigger, before a giant wall closed them out [00:00:24]. Indonesia was the first country to complete this challenge [00:00:59].

### Gymnastics of Death
The second event was a "Gymnastics of Death" course, described as "the craziest set we've ever built" [00:01:55].
> [!NOTE] Challenge Details
> Each round included 10 countries, and only the first five people to reach a middle platform moved on [00:02:04]. A unique twist was that contestants were allowed to decide the order in which they jumped [00:03:09]. This led to some instances of competitors stepping over others to advance [00:03:31]. After this event, 50 more countries were eliminated [00:05:45].

### Archery
The third event involved archery [00:00:11].
> [!NOTE] Challenge Details
> Each contestant was given a bow and arrow and had to hit a target from a platform to move on [00:05:53]. To introduce [[competition_dynamics_in_endurance_challenges | strategic depth]], participants voted for a country of their choice, and for every vote a country received, their target was pushed back ten feet [00:06:01]. Indonesia, one of the fastest in previous rounds, received 12 votes, making their shot the farthest of the day [00:08:33]. Despite their efforts, Indonesia was eliminated [00:09:02].

### Fencing
The fourth event was fencing, featuring [[1v1_challenges_featuring_famous_athletes | one-on-one duels]] [00:00:14].
> [!NOTE] Challenge Details
> The top finishers from the track event chose their opponents [00:10:06]. The first person to hit their opponent won, and the loser would "fall in the void" below [00:10:13]. The suits worn by competitors were rigged with technology used in the real Olympics to detect hits [00:11:17]. Samoa, Iraq, and Slovenia were among the winners of their fencing matches [00:11:12], [00:11:49], [00:12:31]. Libya also won their match [00:13:32].

### Penalty Kicks
The final event was penalty kicks, determining the ultimate winner [00:13:54].
> [!NOTE] Challenge Details
> The rules were simple: kick the ball into the goal to move on; miss and you're out [00:13:58]. Initially, the goal was wide, but as the competition progressed, it was made progressively smaller [00:14:55]. The goal was reduced to be "one Chandler wide" at one point [00:16:00].
> [!WARNING] Final Twist
> For the final round between the last two countries, Libya and Slovenia [00:17:03], the walls of the goal were removed [00:17:14]. Instead, the two finalists took turns being goalkeepers, with the match continuing until one scored and the other failed to save [00:17:18].

## Outcome
Libya ultimately won the $250,000 gold medal after successfully scoring against Slovenia in the final penalty kick round [00:18:16]. Slovenia received a silver medal [00:18:25]. In addition to the top prizes, every contestant who competed received $2,000 [00:18:36].

The [[ancient_egyptian_history_and_architecture | Great Pyramids of Egypt]], including the Pyramid of Khufu, the Pyramid of Khafre, and the Pyramid of Menkaure, served as elaborate tombs for [[ancient_pharaohs_and_their_tombs | ancient pharaohs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. These structures and their associated burial sites provide significant insight into the mortuary practices and beliefs of [[ancient_egyptian_history_and_architecture | ancient Egypt]].

## Pharaohs' Tombs

### King Khufu's Tomb
The Pyramid of Khufu, dating back approximately 4,500 years, contains a passageway believed by Egyptologists to lead to King Khufu's tomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Khufu was the pharaoh who may have ordered the pyramids to be built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The "Grand Gallery" leads to what was thought to be the king's final resting spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This chamber, dating back 4,600 years, may have contained the king's mummified body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Despite this, Egyptologists believe there might be another, undiscovered chamber within the pyramid that holds the king's body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The pyramids were constructed to protect the mummies and treasures within <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

#### Decoy Chambers
During [[exploration_of_the_pyramids | exploration]], a massive chamber was discovered that was completely empty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. This was identified as a decoy chamber, built to mislead potential intruders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. The existence of such elaborate decoys raises questions about whether other presumed burial chambers, like Khufu's, might also be decoys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.

### King Khafre's Tomb
The Pyramid of Khafre provided insight into the original appearance of pyramid casings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Explorers ventured nearly 100 feet below the Earth's surface into Khafreâ€™s pyramid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. An initial chamber was long believed to be King Khafre's burial chamber, but it is now used for storing restoration tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The true resting place of King Khafre is deeper within the pyramid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Graffiti by the discoverer marks the spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### King Menkaure's Tomb
The Pyramid of Menkaure still shows granite casing at its base from 4,600 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Its initial descent leads to the first chamber in [[ancient_egyptian_history_and_architecture | ancient Egyptian history]] with decorative carvings, featuring "false doors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Further down, an antechamber leads to the final burial chamber, which has a vaulted ceiling designed to relieve weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

Adjacent to Menkaure's pyramid are three smaller pyramids, identified as the tombs of King Menkaure's three wives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

## Other Burial Sites

### Tomb of God Osiris
A secret underground tomb, described as the "portal to the underworld," is identified as the tomb of God Osiris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This site is very deep underground, requiring a long descent down a ladder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Explorers found what appeared to be a 3,000-year-old human skull within <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Further down, air becomes thin, leading to lightheadedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. At the center of the lowest room is the sarcophagus of God Osiris, allegedly the portal to the underworld <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### Tomb of Iymery
The tomb of Iymery, the high priest of his time, is typically illegal for public entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. This tomb is particularly significant because its colors and drawings have survived for 4,600 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. The drawings depict the daily life of [[ancient_egyptian_history_and_architecture | Egyptians]], including the process of making wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Other drawings show [[ancient_egyptian_history_and_architecture | Egyptians]] offering items like bread, beer, and brandy to the high priest Iymery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.

### Workman's Tomb
The Workman's Tomb contains the burial sites of the people who built the pyramids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. These individuals, often poorer, do not have the elaborate tomb paintings seen elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. Evidence of their labor is found in the skeletal remains; skeletons of both men and women from 4,600 years ago show stress on their backs, consistent with moving two-ton blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. This physical evidence discredits [[myths_and_theories_about_the_pyramids | theories]] that aliens built the pyramids, reaffirming that [[ancient_egyptian_history_and_architecture | Egyptians]] were the builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

## Conclusion: Purpose of Pyramids
Through [[exploration_of_the_pyramids | extensive exploration]] of the pyramids and various tombs, evidence strongly supports the belief that the pyramids were built by [[ancient_egyptian_history_and_architecture | ancient Egyptians]] as tombs for their pharaohs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. From the worker's tombs showing physical signs of manual labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a> to graffiti indicating the work of "gangs" or "teams" of Khufu's friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>, the findings consistently point to human construction.

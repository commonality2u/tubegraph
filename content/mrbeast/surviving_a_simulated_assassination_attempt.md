A simulated assassination attempt was orchestrated as a high-stakes challenge, with the target, Jimmy, facing an assassin tasked with stabbing him with a rubber knife before the end of the day to win $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The challenge involved multiple elaborate stages designed to evade the assassin.

## Initial Escape and Warehouse Encounter

The challenge began with the assassin initially tied up, but he was able to escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Jimmy provided the assassin with a car in the woods to facilitate his pursuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

Jimmy's first hiding spot was a massive warehouse filled with dozens of train cars, aiming to make it difficult for the assassin to find him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Despite the vastness of the warehouse, Jimmy carried a tracker in his Cars backpack, which also contained the $100,000 prize, giving away his real-time location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The assassin quickly used this tracker to locate the warehouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

To impede the assassin, Jimmy deployed Chris in a tank with instructions to destroy the assassin's car once they were inside the warehouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. After the car was flattened by the tank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, Jimmy escaped in a different getaway car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The assassin and his team were then instructed to either use an Uber or buy a new car to continue the chase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Hotel Hide-and-Seek

For the next phase, Jimmy rented every room in a hotel and installed over a hundred cameras to monitor every inch of the building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. The assassin's tracker again led him to the hotel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Jimmy revealed he was hiding in one of over 200 rooms and had placed "a little something" in every room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

During the search, the assassin located Jimmy's associates, Chandler and Karl, on the 18th floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Jimmy offered a hint for his exact location in the hotel on the condition that the assassin tied up Chandler and Karl in room 1802 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Once they were secured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, Jimmy disclosed that he was on the 20th floor, just two floors above them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

As the assassin approached, Jimmy used the time to perform an ad read, even as the alarm blared indicating the assassin's presence on the floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Jimmy had hidden the elevator with a secret wall to further delay the assassin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. He eventually escaped the hotel in a Lamborghini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

## Bank Vault Deception

Jimmy then took a helicopter to a bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, where he hid in a double-reinforced steel bank vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. The assassin, still tracking him, arrived at the bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

However, Jimmy had set up a trap: there were two bank vaults, and the assassin chose the "easy one" where he became trapped with Nolan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Unbeknownst to the assassin, the entire bank vault he was in was then pulled out of the bank by a truck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a> and driven 10 miles down the road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. As a final dramatic touch, the bank itself was then exploded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

## Carnival and Fake Injury

With less than 40 minutes remaining in the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>, Jimmy headed to the final location: a specially built carnival. This carnival was an elaborate and expensive distraction, as Jimmy's true plan was to fake a serious injury to see if the assassin would still stab him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

He pretended to break his ankle by falling off a ladder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. With only hidden spy cameras rolling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, the assassin was let out of the bank vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. Despite the apparent injury, the assassin was skeptical, noting that "you don't splint a broken ankle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, and ultimately stabbed Jimmy with the rubber knife, winning the $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

A competition featuring 100 participants, ranging in age from one to 100, vies for a grand prize of $250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Unique to this challenge, the participants themselves determine who wins the prize money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Initial Eliminations: The Cubes and Random Selection

The competition begins with contestants occupying individual cubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Early rules dictate that leaving a cube or touching a red boundary line results in immediate elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. As anticipated, the youngest participants, such as the two-year-old, were among the first to be eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Some older contestants also exited early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Within the first hour, six individuals were eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

The first major elimination challenge required the group to collectively decide for 10 people to voluntarily leave their cubes within 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Failure to meet this quota would result in 25 random eliminations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Despite pleas and arguments, including suggestions for the youngest and oldest to leave, only one person (age 89) volunteered to step out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. As a consequence of the group's inability to agree, 25 contestants were randomly selected and eliminated using a ping-pong ball machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This brought the total number of remaining contestants down to 67 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. By the start of Day Two, attrition from overnight exits reduced the count further to 55 contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Captain's Challenge: Betrayal for Money

On Day Two, the contestants were given a chance to unanimously agree on a winner for the $250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. If they failed, a new challenge would result in more eliminations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. As agreement proved impossible, rows of contestants selected captains to represent them in the next task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

The challenge was [[unique_competition_formats | cutthroat]]: captains were offered increasing sums of money. If a captain took the money, they and their entire row would be eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Initial offers were $1,000 and $5,000, which captains resisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. As the offer escalated to $10,000, then $20,000, and $50,000, the pressure mounted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Finally, when the offer reached $100,000, contestant 30 stepped out, eliminating himself and his entire row (the 20s and 30s) from the competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, leading to accusations of betrayal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

## Spinning Wheel Challenge: Control and Alliances

Following the captain's challenge, the contestants again failed to unanimously pick a winner, triggering another elimination round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. This challenge involved a spinning wheel featuring the ages of remaining contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. The contestant whose age was spun would face a choice: either eliminate the person whose age was landed on, or keep them in the competition, in which case the chosen person would then gain control of the wheel and the power to eliminate others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. The goal was to reduce the number of contestants from 36 to a final 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

The challenge quickly highlighted [[contestant_strategies_and_dynamics | alliance dynamics]]. Early eliminations included age 55 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. When age 47 was spun, she was allowed to stay and gained control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Similarly, age 43 was allowed to stay, maintaining the [[contestant_strategies_and_dynamics | 40s alliance's]] control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. The 40s alliance, particularly 42 and 43, strategically eliminated contestants outside their group to maintain control of the wheel and ensure their survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Eliminations in this phase included 66, 57, 65, 17, 16, and 52 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

A particularly emotional elimination involved age 11 (Gio), who was eliminated by age 43 despite a heartfelt plea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. Age 100 was also eliminated but was compensated with $20,000 for his participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. The ruthlessness of the 40s alliance led to resentment from other age groups, particularly the 50s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.

## "Deal or No Deal" Challenge: Honesty vs. Deception

Once more, the contestants failed to agree on a winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. The next challenge mimicked the popular show "Deal or No Deal," featuring 18 briefcases, half marked "eliminated" and half "safe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>. Contestants would pick a briefcase, and then the next youngest person would decide whether to steal that briefcase or pick a random one, based on what the first person claimed was inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.

Notable moments included:
*   Contestant 14 claimed his case was "safe," and 41 stole it, confirming it was indeed safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.
*   Later, 14 claimed his case was "eliminated," and 43 chose a new case. 14's case was indeed "eliminated," leading to his removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.
*   Age 43 stated her case was "not safe" and 3 decided not to steal it; she was indeed eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>.
*   Contestant 48, a member of the 40s alliance, lied about his case containing "eliminated" to prevent it from being stolen. When 51 chose not to steal, 48 revealed his case was "safe," leading to 51's elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.
*   A selfless act occurred when 54 claimed her case was "eliminated." A contestant chose to "steal" it to save her, sacrificing himself and being eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>.
*   In the final two briefcases, 96 (the oldest remaining contestant) claimed his case was "eliminated," but it was "safe." Contestant 67 chose not to steal, believing 96, and was eliminated, making 96 the oldest person left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>.

This challenge reduced the contestant pool to the final nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>.

## Final Elimination: Story-Based Voting

As the competition progressed into its final day, trust among contestants waned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. With another unanimous vote for a winner failing, the final nine faced a new challenge: they had to choose four people to eliminate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>. Each contestant shared their personal story and reasons for needing the prize money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>. The emotional weight of these stories made the decision-making process incredibly difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>.

The eliminations were conducted through a vote:
*   Contestant 61 was the first to be voted out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>.
*   Contestant 46 followed, leading to the "implosion" of the 40s alliance as they voted each other out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>.
*   Contestant 96 was eliminated next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.
*   The final elimination came down to a public vote between 72 and 41, with 72 ultimately receiving the majority of votes and being eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>.

## The Ultimate Decision: Collaboration or Destruction

With only five contestants remaining, the ultimate twist was revealed: they could now exit their individual cubes and gather in a large central cube for the final challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>. The group had one hour to collectively decide on a single winner for the $250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>. If more than one person remained in the cube when the timer hit zero, the prize money would be destroyed by flamethrowers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>.

Initially, no one was willing to leave, and discussions about individual struggles were met with resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">[00:36:25]</a>. Facing the imminent loss of the prize, contestant 48 proposed [[contestant_competition_strategies | ranked-choice voting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>. This system allowed everyone to rank who they thought deserved the money most, and the person consistently ranked highest would win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>.

After tallying the votes, contestant 56 was in fifth place, and 41 and 64 tied for third <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>. The decision came down to 47 and 48, who had maintained the strongest alliance throughout the competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>. Ultimately, contestant 47 was declared the winner of the $250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>. The four runner-ups each received $10,000 as a consolation prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a>.

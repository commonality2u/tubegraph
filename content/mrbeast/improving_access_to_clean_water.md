A significant initiative has been undertaken to provide access to clean drinking water by constructing 100 wells across various African communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, aiming to provide fresh water to approximately half a million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This project seeks to alleviate [[challenges_faced_by_villages_without_clean_water | challenges faced by villages without clean water]] and foster [[community_impact_of_water_projects | community impact of water projects]] through improved living conditions.

## Providing Clean Water in Kenya

The project began in Kenya, where a small village gained access to clean drinking water almost instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Subsequent efforts focused on the Nairiri school system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### Nairiri School: Before and After

Students at the Nairiri school previously sourced their water from a river that was "extremely unsafe to drink" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This contaminated water led to students suffering from diarrhea, infections like typhoid, and other health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The reliance on unsafe water limited children's lives and sometimes cut them short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

The intervention involved installing a well that extracts pure, drinkable water from an enormous aquifer, hundreds of feet underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The water is fed into large barrels and built into water towers, providing not only clean drinking water but also a pressurized source for neighboring villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This means an end to doing laundry in unsafe water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. The well in Nairiri can provide 3,600 gallons of water per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, serving the 400 students at the school, the entire neighborhood, and the surrounding village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. These wells are designed to pump non-stop for 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Wider Community Support in Kenya

Beyond water, the initiative also extended to [[supporting_education_and_infrastructure_in_african_communities | supporting education and infrastructure in African communities]] in Kenya by:
*   Updating one of the schools with brand new computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   Updating classrooms with new furniture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   Installing shelves and filling them with new books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   Donating a soccer ball for every student <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   Installing modern whiteboards and projectors in all classrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, which improved cleanliness compared to chalkboards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

### Addressing Specific Infrastructure Challenges

One community faced a daily, treacherous, mile-long hike through the jungle and up a giant mountain to fetch water from an unsafe spigot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Children carried jugs weighing up to 40 pounds back up the mountain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. A new well was installed only ten feet from the school, eliminating the dangerous journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

Another village was divided by a dangerous river, which, during the rainy season, would swell and sweep away people, students, or animals, leading to the loss of about three lives recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. To address this, a new bridge was constructed to provide safe passage for the community to reach their well, hospital, and schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. This new bridge is expected to be used for the next 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

## Expanding to Other African Nations

The initiative expanded beyond Kenya, with wells also being built in Zimbabwe, Uganda, Somalia, and Cameroon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

### Zimbabwe Hospital and Community Support

In Zimbabwe, a local hospital delivering around 600 babies annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a> previously required pregnant mothers to walk over a mile to fetch water and carry heavy buckets back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. A new, modern well was constructed for the hospital, providing immediate access to clean water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Additionally, new bicycles were provided to students in the village to assist with transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

### Specialized Solar-Powered Wells

One of the wells, number 69, is solar-powered and specifically designed to aid farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Each panel is 200 watts, attached to a pump that can pump 5,000 liters every hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. This provides "unlimited amount of water" for crops and livestock, even during the dry season, without needing electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

## The Broader Impact and Call to Action

The initiative emphasizes the profound [[community_impact_of_water_projects | importance of building wells]], as it brings water to farms to feed the hungry, provides clean conditions for hospitals, and most importantly, helps the children of the next generation live long, healthy lives, enabling them to build the future for their communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

While 100 wells will change many lives, the need is still immense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. The project urges individuals to donate through beastphilanthropy.org/wells, with 100% of the money raised going towards [[building_wells_in_africa | building more wells]] globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:56">[00:59:56]</a>. This highlights a commitment to [[charitable_initiatives_for_global_health | charitable initiatives for global health]] and the belief that solving this problem is possible and requires collective effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

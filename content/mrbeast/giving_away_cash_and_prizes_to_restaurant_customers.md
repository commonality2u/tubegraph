The world's first free restaurant also engaged in [[surprise_giveaways_and_prizes | surprising customers with gifts and unforeseen rewards]] and cash, even paying people to eat there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Initial Customer Rewards

*   The very first customers were given $100 for waiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, and then another $100 when their wait extended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   To manage the long line and traffic issues, staff were instructed to distribute burgers and cash directly to people waiting in their cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   When there were no burgers ready, staff would give away $100 bills instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   A large sum of $200,000 was provided to continue [[giving_away_portions_of_prize_money_to_family_and_friends | giving away money]] to customers while waiting for more burgers to be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Unique Prize Distributions

*   Customers were presented with a choice between a bag containing a burger and fries, or a bag filled with AirPods and a significant amount of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. One customer who chose the money bag was also permitted to receive the food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

*   When napkins ran out, money was used as a substitute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   The restaurant began operating a second window to increase output and competition in [[winners_and_prizes_distribution | prize distribution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   Apple products, including iPads, were given away to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   An entire cash register filled with money was given to a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
*   Snacks were provided to the last people in line to hold them over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## Large-Scale Gifts and Assistance

*   A car was spontaneously purchased and given to a family whose vehicle was side-swiped while waiting in line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

*   $10,000 was given to a family to fix their broken car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   The very last customer was given three burgers and a large sum of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

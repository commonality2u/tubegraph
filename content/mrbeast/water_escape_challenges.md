[[Survival challenges | Survival challenges]] featured in a video include a specific water escape challenge where contestant Mack had to retrieve money from a sinking car. This challenge aimed to test Mack's fears and determination to win back a large sum of money he had previously lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## The Sinking Car Challenge

This segment, identified as Challenge Three of Six, involved a car being submerged in a lake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Setup and Objective
The car was positioned facing a lake, though it was not driven in. Instead, it was dropped into the water by a crane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The primary objective for Mack was to retrieve as many of the eight duffel bags containing $800,000 from the sinking vehicle as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Any bags left behind would be lost forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Execution and Obstacles
*   **Rapid Sinking**: Upon being dropped, the car began to sink quickly, with Mack having approximately 20 seconds to escape before it was fully submerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Visibility and Depth**: As the car sank deeper, it became increasingly difficult for Mack to reach and see the bags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. The car eventually reached the bottom of the lake, approximately 45 feet deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Hidden Difficulty**: Unbeknownst to Mack, the final two bags of money were seatbelted into the back seat, adding a significant unexpected challenge to their retrieval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Mack's Prowess**: Mack, described as a "borderline Olympic swimmer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>, demonstrated strong swimming and breath-holding abilities, managing to retrieve several bags despite the freezing cold water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. He successfully saved $700,000 but was unable to retrieve the final $100,000 due to the extreme depth and lack of visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

### Safety Measures
Seven safety divers were on standby during the challenge to ensure Mack's well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

## Outcome
Mack completed the water escape challenge, successfully retrieving $700,000 of the original $800,000 prize money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. His prize money was then adjusted to this new amount for the remaining challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

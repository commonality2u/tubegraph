Upon reaching the final day of the challenge, the participants had one primary objective: to leave the abandoned city and never return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. After cleaning up their camp, they expressed relief and a desire for "Freedom!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

## Coping with loneliness

Throughout the challenge, especially after Kris and Chandler departed, the remaining participants acknowledged feeling lonely in the abandoned city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. To combat this, they engaged in various activities like playing baseball, soccer, skipping rocks, and yelling across the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. These "kind of dumb things" helped to distract them from the pervasive loneliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.

## Appreciation for Mark's participation

A significant reflection at the end of the challenge was an expression of gratitude towards Mark. It was noted that Mark, despite having his own busy channel, participated in the challenge, which was deeply appreciated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

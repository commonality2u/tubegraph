Two strangers, Hase and Grizz, were dropped into the wilderness to see how long they could survive for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. They had never met before the challenge began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. For every day they survived, they would receive $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, with no theoretical limit to their winnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The challenge could be ended by firing a flare gun, allowing them to leave with their accumulated winnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Initially, the plan was to stay for a year, aiming for $3.6 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Initial Challenges and Establishing Camp

Upon arrival, their immediate goals were to find a camping spot, build a fire, and survive the night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. They started with approximately five days' worth of food and two containers of water, along with a change of clothes, warm jackets, and a fire starter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. After successfully starting a fire, they made beds out of pine needles for warmth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

Their first night was cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. On Day 2, they received their first $10,000, dropped from a plane in a parachuted briefcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. They also received a flare gun, which could be used to end the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Shelter Construction

By Day 3, tired of sleeping on the ground, they began constructing a more substantial shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. They gathered pine needles and layered them on the structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>, incorporating a metal piece from a swing set for the roof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The parachutes and their cords from the money drops were repurposed to create a rain cover for the shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

### Resource Management and Food Scarcity

On Day 4, they started looking for a water source, locating a swamp that they intended to boil to remove bacteria and parasites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

Despite building a shelter, the nights remained cold, and they consistently got only about two hours of sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Their initial food supplies ran out by Day 5, and by Day 9, they were experiencing significant hunger, referring to it as a "fast" instead of starvation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. They resorted to eating Greenbrier leaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Key Developments and Offers

On Day 10, to celebrate their survival, they were offered an additional ten days' worth of food, spices, two tarps, and fishing equipment for $50,000 of their prize money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. They accepted the offer, despite the significant cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

They discovered that the nearby swamp contained no fish, necessitating the search for moving water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. They soon found a creek with moving water and fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. They decided to move their camp and build a new shelter near this water source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Their new shelter featured an A-frame structure, with them cutting trees to the right length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. They also constructed a fishing dock to aid in [[finding_food_and_resources_in_the_wild | catching fish]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

On Day 20, they were offered sleeping bags. They could buy one for $10,000 or two for $50,000. Despite the cold nights, they declined the offer, believing they had adapted to the low temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### Food and Fishing Struggles

Despite the fishing gear and dock, they struggled to [[finding_food_and_resources_in_the_wild | catch fish]] for many days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. On Day 27, they finally caught their first fish, an eel, which they charcoal grilled and found delicious after almost 30 days without fresh food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. On Day 28, they began constructing raised beds in their new shelter for more comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

Their location near the creek, however, didn't consistently provide fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. After surviving an entire month, they were offered a "dollar store" with supplies like firewood, a shovel, cooking supplies, bedding, books, and games, with each item costing $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. They declined all items, believing they could improvise with parachutes or find what they needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

As food rations dwindled, they decided to travel through the swamp to a river in hopes of better fishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Hase's makeshift fishing pole broke, forcing him to hand-fish, but he eventually succeeded in catching fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

## Emotional Toll and Climax

On Day 40, they were offered the chance to see their wives for $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. Both accepted, leading to an emotional reunion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. The visit, while positive, highlighted the challenges of being away from family, particularly for Hase, who had a newborn son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a> and a two-year-old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

Spring brought warmer weather, but also new [[survival_challenges | challenges]] like snakes and rats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. Lack of sleep and continued [[challenges_of_extreme_survival_scenarios | survival pressures]] led to irritability between Hase and Grizz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. Hase temporarily paddled away to calm down, returning later with fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. Grizz built a table from a dropped board as a peace offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

On Day 50, after Hase built a functional boat using sticks and a tarp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>, they were ironically offered a boat with a Zaxby's restaurant for $50,000 (later discounted to $40,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. They declined the boat offer, trusting Hase's self-made vessel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

As the challenge continued, Hase increasingly felt the pull of his family, desiring to return home despite the financial incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. Grizz, on the other hand, still aimed for a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>. The tension mounted, leading to a conversation about ending the challenge on Day 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. Hase, feeling desperate and missing his family, took the flare gun from Grizz's bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. Despite Grizz's initial desire to continue, he recognized Hase's emotional distress and supported his friend's decision to end the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.

## Conclusion

The flare was shot on Day 74 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. After 74 days in the wilderness, Hase and Grizz won a total of $670,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. They were reunited with their families, changed by their intense [[outdoor_survival_skills | outdoor survival skills]] experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>.

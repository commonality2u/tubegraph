The wilderness survival challenge centered on two strangers, Hase and Grizz, dropped into the wilderness to survive for as long as possible, earning $10,000 for every day they endured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Their immediate and evolving [[friendship and competition dynamics|friendship]] became a central aspect of their survival and decision-making throughout the 74-day ordeal.

## Initial Meeting and Alliance
Upon meeting, Hase and Grizz, who had never encountered each other before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, quickly formed a bond. Grizz declared, "You're gonna be my best friend for the next, however long. Starting now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Their initial plan was to aim for a year of survival, which would make them multimillionaires, and they agreed to split all winnings equally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This immediate alliance set the stage for their [[team_dynamics_and_strategies|team dynamics]], with a mutual understanding that they "can't screw each other over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Collaborative Survival
From the outset, their [[competition_dynamics_and_teamwork|teamwork]] was crucial for survival. They worked together to find a camping spot, build a fire, and manage their limited supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Their collective efforts included:
*   **Shelter Building:** After receiving their first $10,000, they began constructing a more permanent shelter, utilizing materials like pine needles for bedding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. They even used parachutes and cord from money drops to create a rain cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Resource Management:** They shared their initial five days' worth of food and two containers of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. When supplies dwindled, they scouted for water sources and discussed the edibility of plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Physical and Emotional Support:** In freezing temperatures, Hase noted that Grizz's size provided warmth, leading him to sleep closer to Grizz than his own wife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This highlights the intimate nature of their [[friendship_dynamics_in_highstress_challenges|friendship dynamics in highstress challenges]].

## Navigating Challenges and Shared Decisions
Their [[social_dynamics_in_group_challenges|social dynamics in group challenges]] were tested by dwindling supplies, harsh weather, and the mental toll of isolation.
*   **Offers and Refusals:** Despite enduring cold nights, they collaboratively decided to decline an offer for sleeping bags, valuing their prize money over comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. They similarly refused various supplies from a "dollar store" where each item cost $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **Building a Boat:** Hase undertook building a makeshift boat using sticks and a tarp, aiming to reach a better fishing river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. This independent initiative to support their shared goal showcased their evolving [[team_dynamics_and_alliances_in_competitions|team dynamics and alliances in competitions]]. They later refused a professionally supplied boat for $40,000, trusting Hase's creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

## Strain and Reconciliation
As the challenge progressed, the continuous stress and lack of sleep led to friction.
*   **Irritability:** After more than a month in the wilderness, lack of sleep and the presence of pests made them irritable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. Hase, particularly, reached the "end of his rope," and Grizz's jokes stopped landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
*   **Temporary Separation:** Hase, feeling frustrated, temporarily separated from Grizz, paddling downriver to set up his own camp for a night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
*   **Reconciliation:** Upon Hase's return with fish, Grizz had built them a table from a dropped board, demonstrating his efforts to cheer Hase up and mend their relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. Hase appreciated the gesture, acknowledging, "Feels good to be home" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. Their [[friend_dynamics_during_challenges|friend dynamics during challenges]] recovered, with Hase stating, "Welcome back, buddy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

## Conflicting Goals and The Ultimate Sacrifice
Individual motivations began to diverge as the challenge neared its end.
*   **Hase's Family:** Hase was primarily motivated by providing college money for his children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. His wife urged him to come home, emphasizing his need to bond with his newborn son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. He consistently thought about using the flare gun to end the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.
*   **Grizz's Ambition:** Grizz wanted to continue until they reached $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>. He often pushed Hase to stay longer, even when Hase expressed a desire to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.
*   **The Flare Gun Dilemma:** The flare gun, signaling the end of the challenge, became a symbol of their conflicting desires. Hase eventually stole the flare gun, desperate to return to his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. In a raw conversation, Hase expressed that the money no longer mattered to him, and Grizz was the only thing keeping him there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>.
*   **Grizz's Decision:** Faced with his friend's distress, Grizz made the difficult decision to prioritize Hase's well-being over financial gain. He acknowledged Hase as a "brother" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>, apologized for pushing him, and ultimately allowed Hase to fire the flare, ending their 74-day journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.

The challenge concluded with Hase and Grizz earning $670,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. More importantly, Hase stated he walked away with "a friend for life," which he found "meaningful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

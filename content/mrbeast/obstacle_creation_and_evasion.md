Evasion challenges often involve the strategic creation or exploitation of obstacles and environments to impede pursuers. This can range from physical barriers to misdirection and the use of terrain.

## Creating Obstacles

One direct method of [[challenges_and_hiding_strategies | obstacle creation]] is to destroy existing infrastructure. For instance, a bridge can be purposely blown up to block the quickest escape route for pursuers, forcing them to take a longer path and providing a head start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This tactic was used in a challenge to gain a five to ten minute advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The successful destruction of the bridge was heard even a mile down the road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Environments can also be designed to create confusion or limit movement. This includes:
*   **Large-scale rentals:** Renting an entire museum, along with dozens of cars and giant military equipment, establishes a vast and complex play area for evasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Confusing layouts:** Utilizing a warehouse full of jeeps can confuse pursuers, especially if the vehicles are driven in random directions upon their arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Natural barriers:** Attempting to use natural terrain like rocks that cars "shouldn't be able to go over" can serve as an intended obstacle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, though pursuers may sometimes overcome them unexpectedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Constructed Hiding Spots:** Creating a "makeshift rock" within a museum for concealment exemplifies a direct, fabricated hiding obstacle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## Evasion Tactics

Successful evasion in a [[military_evasion_challenge | military evasion challenge]] relies on a combination of speed, deception, and strategic use of environment and technology. Key [[escape_tactics_and_evasion_techniques | evasion techniques]] include:

*   **Gaining a Head Start:** Purposely parking the pursuers' vehicle further away provides an initial advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   **Vehicle-Based Evasion:** Using vehicles like jeeps for quick movement and to confuse pursuers by driving in random directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Concealment within Vehicles:** Hiding inside a car by reclining the seat and covering oneself with a blanket can prevent detection even when driving past pursuers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Tracker Jamming:** Employing a special bag to jam a tracking device renders the pursuers unaware of the evadee's location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **Decoys:** Using a decoy, such as burying a confederate with the tracker, can misdirect pursuers while the target escapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This requires convincing acting from the decoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Utilizing Hiding Spots:** Hiding in dense foliage like woods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a> or lying down beside a path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a> can allow the evadee to remain undetected even when pursuers pass nearby.
*   **Distraction and Misinformation:**
    *   Employing team members to distract pursuers, such as having someone engage them in conversation to buy time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
    *   Using phone calls to provide false information or to hang up on pursuers to create confusion and frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
    *   Directly misinforming pursuers about one's location within a large facility like a museum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

In a museum setting, strategic hiding spots like corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a> or under elaborate displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, combined with turning off lights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, contribute to effective evasion. However, even subtle clues like visible shoes can betray a hiding spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

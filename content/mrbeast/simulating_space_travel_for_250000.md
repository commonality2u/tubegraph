The cost to simulate going to space is a quarter of a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This unique experience involves flying in a specialized plane that creates a zero-gravity environment through a series of nosedives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## The Zero Gravity Experience
The $250,000 zero-gravity experience begins with the plane ascending and then performing nosedives to induce weightlessness inside the cabin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Participants can float freely, often finding themselves upside down as they drift within the aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

During this experience, various activities were attempted:
*   **Racing** Attempts were made to race from one side of the plane to the other while in zero gravity, though it proved challenging as movement without gravity is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Leaf Blower Experiment** A leaf blower was used to spin a participant in the zero-gravity environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **MrBeast Lab Swarms Assembly** An attempt was made to assemble MrBeast Lab Swarms toys in zero gravity, which involved pouring water into tubes and shaking them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This proved to be more difficult than anticipated due to the weightless conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

This zero-gravity simulation was considered an impressive experience, setting a high bar for subsequent activities like the [[unique_experiences_flying_on_a_500000_plane | $500,000 experience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. It was described as cooler than the [[exploring_ocean_depths_with_submarine_for_50000 | $50,000 submarine exploration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

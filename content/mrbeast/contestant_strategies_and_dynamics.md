In the "Last to Leave Circle" challenge, contestants employed various [[Contestant competition strategies | strategies]] and revealed different dynamics as they vied for a monetary prize tied to video views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The winner would receive $1,000 for every million views on the video, paid for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Initial Dynamics and Goals

From the outset, contestants expressed competitive intentions:
*   One contestant declared that "Tareq's not winning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   Another confidently predicted their own victory, stating, "Hi, me in the future, you won" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   The idea of "betray[ing] each other" by "get[ting] in each other's heads" was acknowledged early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   An initial [[Winning strategies in contests | strategy]] was to wait for others, specifically Tareq, to be eliminated first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   Despite being in the same circle, a contestant wished another luck while simultaneously asserting their own competitive stance: "Even though we're in the same circle, I wish you the best of luck, 'cause you're going against me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Reactions to Conditions and Items

Contestants showed varied [[Interpersonal dynamics and reactions during contests | reactions]] to the conditions and items provided:
*   Receiving items like a kite or a beanbag chair led to positive reactions, with some finding the challenge "a lot of fun" initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   The introduction of an RC car led to a trade proposition where two contestants offered their beanbag chair for the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. However, this turned into a deceptive maneuver, as they kept the beanbag chair after receiving the RC car, declaring "This is war, Tareq!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This act of "burning my Mario kart" ignited further [[Interpersonal dynamics and reactions during contests | conflict]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   When forced to downsize circles, contestants adapted, with one even managing to find a way to "sprawl out" in the smaller space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   Physical discomfort was a common reaction as the challenge progressed, with contestants reporting hurting feet, knees, and wobbling legs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

## Persistence and Motivation

Despite the increasing difficulty, contestants demonstrated strong resolve:
*   One contestant stated their commitment, "I'm not quitting this challenge no matter what" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   The primary [[Contestants motivations for winning | motivation for winning]] was often external, with contestants aiming to provide financial support for their parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. One contestant explicitly mentioned wanting to help his mother who had lost her job due to the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   Even when boredom set in after three days, the desire to win for family remained a driving force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

## Evolution of Contestant Behavior and Rule Bending

As the challenge wore on, [[Contestant competition strategies | contestant behavior]] became more extreme:
*   Contestants resorted to using a "pee bucket" to avoid leaving their circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   [[Strategies and tactics used by contestants | Attempts at sabotage]] included setting off the fire alarm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, and intentional splashing to provoke reactions and potential rule violations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   One contestant was eliminated when a review of the tape showed they put their hands on the ground without being pushed, despite initially claiming sabotage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. This led to a significant moment of [[Contestant experiences and eliminations | elimination]] and reflection on past challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

## Final Stages and Decision Making

In the final stages, with only two contestants remaining and the circles significantly reduced in size, [[Contestants decision making | decision-making]] became critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. The final offer of $5,000 to quit was presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. One contestant, Tyler, accepted the $5,000, stating it was "way more than I ever was expecting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. Tareq ultimately won the challenge, remaining in the circle for 72 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. His win was described as "winning the lottery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

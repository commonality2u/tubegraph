A series of [[unique_giveaways_and_competitions | unique giveaways and competitions]] were organized for subscribers, offering them chances to win substantial sums of money and valuable prizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## House or Lamborghini Choice
One contestant was given the choice between a real Lamborghini and a house, without knowing what either looked like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The house had three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a kitchen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The contestant ultimately chose the house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The Lamborghini they passed up was a modern model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, but the house was ultimately valued at $90,000 more than the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Pull-Up Bar Challenge
A physically demanding challenge offered $100 for every second a participant could hang from a pull-up bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Hanging for 10 minutes would equate to $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. One participant earned $1,000 within the first 10 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> and ultimately won $15,000 for hanging for 2 minutes and 25 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## $100,000 Dart Throw
A contestant had to hit a bullseye with a dart from behind a $100,000 cash display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Despite a close attempt, the participant did not hit the bullseye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Pickaxe Safe Cracking
A participant chose a pickaxe to open a large safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, with the goal of retrieving valuable items inside by the end of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The safe contained Orbeez <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>, and within those, a smaller safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. This smaller safe then revealed another safe, and then another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. The final safe contained baby pictures of the hosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>, and ultimately, a $6,000 diamond ring and $15,000 in diamonds, plus $10,000 in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

## Arm Wrestling Challenge
Contestants could win $10,000 by arm wrestling and defeating specific individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. One participant won $10,000 by defeating Karl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. He then opted for "double or nothing," where Karl was allowed to use both hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. The participant won again, increasing his winnings to $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## The "Punch You in the Face" Challenge
A participant was offered $1,000 or the chance to let Chandler punch them in the face for $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. The participant chose the $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. However, the "you" Chandler was to punch was revealed to be a mannequin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, resulting in the participant winning $10,000 without physical harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This showcased [[creative_rules_for_winning_prizes | creative rules for winning prizes]].

## McDonald's Burger Guess and Bonus Steps
A random McDonald's employee was challenged to identify which of two burgers (McDonald's or Burger King) was made by McDonald's for $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. He correctly identified the McDonald's burger without tasting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. As a subscriber, he was then offered to risk his $5,000 to take three steps for $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, which he successfully completed, winning $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## Dodgeball Karl
Contestants threw dodgeballs covered in paint at a blindfolded Karl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Each hit earned them $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. One participant hit Karl five times, and another hit him six times, winning $5,000 and $6,000 respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

## Extreme Cornhole Challenge
A game of cornhole offered various prize tiers: $100, $1,000, $10,000, $20,000, and a distant, tiny hole worth $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. The $1 million hole required a piece of corn to fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. A contestant, Cam, had three throws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. After failing to hit the $1,000 hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, he was persuaded not to go for the $100 hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a> and ultimately attempted the $10,000 hole with the ear of corn, but missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. He received $100 for not going for the $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This was one of the [[games_and_conquests_with_highvalue_prizes | games and contests with high-value prizes]].

## Tiered Dart Throw for Charity
A dart throwing challenge featured increasing prize amounts based on distance: $100, $1,000, $10,000 (for popping a large balloon), and $20,000 (for popping a farther balloon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. Brandon, a participant, chose to go for the $20,000 prize to pay for his kids' college and medical bills from a kidney transplant and colon cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. He successfully popped the balloon, winning $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

## Pay It Forward
A contestant playing for a charity, Building Hope Community Life Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>, was given $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. He was then offered another $1,000 or the option to "pay it forward" and give the next person $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. He chose to pay it forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>, and was rewarded with an additional $10,000 for being a good person, plus the initial $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

## Watch History Payout
The person who received the $5,000 from the "pay it forward" challenge was offered $100 for every MrBeast video they had watched from start to finish on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. This unique way to earn money resulted in him winning $600 from his watch history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>, in addition to the $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

## Double or Nothing Bottle Flip
A contestant was offered $1,000 for successfully completing a single bottle flip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. After making the first flip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, he was given the option to go "double or nothing" as many times as he wished, risking his current winnings for double the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. He successfully completed a second flip, turning his $1,000 into $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>, but chose to stop there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

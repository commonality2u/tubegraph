In a recent video titled "I Built Two Massive Circles and Filled Them With 100 Boys and 100 Girls," renowned YouTuber MrBeast orchestrated a competition that brought to light interesting aspects of gender dynamics and team strategies. The objective was simple yet intense: whichever group, boys or girls, had more people remaining after 100 hours within their designated circle would win a whopping $500,000 to be split amongst their team members. The challenge sparked fascinating behavioral insights and strategic actions driven by the participants' interactions and decision-making processes. Here, we dive into how [[psychology_and_group_dynamics_in_competitions | gender dynamics]] and different team strategies played a role in this intriguing social experiment.

## Initial Strategies and Group Dynamics

From the very start, both groups appeared enthusiastic and confident in their capabilities. The boys chanted "Boys rule, girls drool" while the girls responded with "Boys, you suck!" showcasing an immediate competitive yet playful gender dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This banter set the stage for a rivalry that would persist throughout the competition.

### Boys' Strategy: Unified Front with Initial Weaknesses

Initially, the boys struggled with organizational adherence to the rules of the competition. Within the first 20 minutes, five boys had already left the circle, suggesting potential cracks in their initial commitment and focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Many left due to external commitments or lack of preparation for the challenge, indicating a lack of thorough [[decision_making_and_honesty_in_high_stakes_situations | pre-challenge strategy]].

### Girls' Strategy: Strength in Numbers

Conversely, the girls maintained all 100 participants initially, showing a stronger group commitment from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Their approach seemed more cohesive, with fewer immediate exits due to external distractions. This initial steadfastness marked a significant early advantage and demonstrated the girls' stronger collective discipline in the early hours of competition.

## Adapting Strategies Over Time

As the challenge progressed, both groups evolved their strategies based on internal and external pressures.

### Responses to External Stressors

The monotonous conditions started to take their toll on both groups. The introduction of unappetizing food such as oatmeal caused the boys to lose an additional 16 members, emphasizing a vulnerability to psychological and physical discomforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. The girls, however, proved more resilient, losing only four participants to the same culinary plight.

### Task-Based Competition: The Rubik's Cube Challenge

The teams faced a Rubik's Cube challenge where each group had 100 cubes to solve. This task starkly highlighted differences in strategic thinking and skill distribution. Only one individual from each team knew how to solve a Rubik's cube, putting both groups under significant pressure. The boys initially began to outperform until MrBeast offered the sole solver $10,000 to leave, which he accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This tactical decision greatly impacted the boys' performance, leading to their eventual failure in this mini-challenge and a penalty of having their circle cut in half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. 

## Final Hours and Closing Dynamics

As the competition neared its end, the circles continued to shrink, heightening the pressure and forcing each team to optimize space usage and personnel management through strategic discussions. Each group faced internal divisions on how to maintain cohesion and maximize remaining resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

### Outcome and Observations

Ultimately, after 100 grueling hours, the girls emerged victorious. With 35 girls remaining compared to 33 boys, the victory was narrow but demonstrated the girls' consistent discipline and cooperation throughout the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. The girls' initial steadfastness and ability to recover from mid-challenge setbacks underscored a robust group dynamic that effectively adapted and endured under stress, reflecting potential [[strategies_and_team_dynamics_in_competition | gender-based differences]] in approach to teamwork and resilience.

> [!info] Conclusion
> The event mirrored complex social dynamics and [[strategy_and_tactics_for_endurance_challenges | team strategies]] where both groups showed diverse approaches to achieving the same goal. While external incentives and psychological pressures played critical roles, core group dynamics and decision-making capabilities ultimately shaped the path to success. Through this experiment, MrBeast highlighted underlying gender dynamics that fostered both collaboration and competition under strenuous conditions, offering viewers not just entertainment but also a chance to reflect on broader social themes.

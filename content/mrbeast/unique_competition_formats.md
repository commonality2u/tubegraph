A competition featuring 100 individuals, ranging in age from one to 100, trapped in individual glass cubes, offered half a million dollars to the last person to leave their cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The entire event was monitored by over 300 cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This core "last to leave" concept was augmented by various player-driven and host-introduced challenges, creating a dynamic and [[challenge_format_and_rules | unique contest format]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Initial Phase: Endurance and Noise Strategy
The challenge began with contestants simply enduring their confinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. One early [[contestant_competition_strategies | strategy]] employed by younger contestants was to make a lot of noise to prevent others from sleeping, hoping they would quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This tactic proved effective, causing older participants and even some children to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Within a couple of hours, 10 people had already exited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Player-Voted Challenges
After 24 hours, with 76 people remaining, contestants were given the opportunity to vote on whether to introduce a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. A majority vote for "green" meant a challenge would occur, potentially eliminating many participants, while "red" meant continuing as usual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. 63 people voted for a challenge, and 13 did not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This voting mechanism significantly altered the [[competition dynamics and teamwork | competition dynamics]] from a pure endurance test to one with active player decisions influencing the game.

### Oversized Three Cup Monte
The first voted-in challenge was an oversized version of Three Cup Monte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. A ball was placed under one of three large cups, which were then moved around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Contestants who correctly identified the ball's location stayed, while others were eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This challenge also introduced elements of social influence, as some participants lost track of the ball and had to rely on neighbors for answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Some players even developed a [[contestant_competition_strategies | strategy]] of intentionally giving wrong answers to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### The Purge: Direct Elimination Voting
Another challenge vote was held on day four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. With 47 contestants remaining, the majority voted for a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This challenge involved contestants writing down the number of another participant they wished to eliminate; the person with the most votes was removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. This "purge" round led to direct targeting, with previously lied-to individuals voting out those who had deceived them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Alliances and "power blocks," such as the group of 50-year-olds, emerged, strategically eliminating others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

### Jenga Elimination
Following the purge, a new challenge was introduced where contestants had to pull blocks from a Jenga tower in their cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. If their tower fell, they were eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. This continued until only ten people remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. This challenge eliminated all contestants over the age of 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

### Marble Game
For the final ten contestants, another challenge vote was held, with everyone voting yes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. This challenge was a marble game, similar to one from a previous "Squid Games" video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. Contestants played one-on-one against a neighbor, each starting with ten marbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. They could choose any game to play, and the goal was to accumulate 20 marbles within 30 minutes to advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. Games chosen included coin flips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>, throwing marbles into buckets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>, and "all or nothing" rock-paper-scissors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

### Eliminated Contestants' Vote
With five contestants remaining, another challenge was voted in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. In this unique twist, the 95 previously eliminated contestants voted on who they wanted gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. The three contestants with the most votes were eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. This challenge leveraged the social dynamics and perceived fairness of the competition, as contestants worried about their past interactions affecting their standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

### Final Bluff Challenge
The final two contestants, after spending over a week in their cubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>, also chose to engage in a final challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. Two briefcases were presented, one containing the $500,000 check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. The host, blindfolded along with the crew, mixed the cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>. A coin flip decided which contestant got to look inside their briefcase, making them the only person aware of the money's location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. The other contestant then had to decide whether to keep their own briefcase or steal the opponent's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. This ultimate test of bluff and trust determined the winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. The winner was the one who was honest about the money's location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>.

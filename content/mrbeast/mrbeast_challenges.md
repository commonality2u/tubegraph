[[MrBeast's role and interactions | MrBeast]] hosts various [[youtuber_competition_challenges | challenges]] where participants compete for a grand prize, often involving a [[challenge_to_win_100000 | $100,000 challenge]] or other substantial sums of money, or a valuable item like a diamond. The [[mr_beast_challenge_setup_and_rules | challenge setup and rules]] frequently involve players losing "lives" for mistakes, with penalties and advantages introduced throughout the competition.

## Diamond Heist Challenge

The central [[challenge to win money | challenge]] involved contestants attempting to steal a giant $100,000 diamond, protected by an advanced security system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Participants included Chris, Nolan, Karl, and Chandler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The objective was to be the first to reach the diamond, with various laser maze courses designed to make it difficult. Participants wore vests that displayed their remaining "lives" or "hearts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### Laser Maze 1: Basic Lasers

The first stage involved navigating a room filled with red lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.
*   **Penalty**: The last person to complete the course had to do the next one on one leg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: Karl finished first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, meaning Chandler had to complete the next stage on one leg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Laser Maze 2: Dual-Color Lasers

This course featured two colors of lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Penalty**: Touching a laser resulted in losing a life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Chandler, already on one leg, struggled significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: All four contestants (Chris, Nolan, Karl, Chandler) lost a life on this course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **MrBeast's Intervention**: Due to everyone losing a life, [[MrBeast's role and interactions | MrBeast]] secretly placed an extra life in the next stage without telling them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### Laser Maze 3: Hidden Diamond & Extra Life

In this stage, contestants could start immediately upon entering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Secret Setup**: [[MrBeast's role and interactions | MrBeast]] moved the diamond above the door, where it could technically be reached easily, and placed an extra life on the ground as a distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: Chris found the extra life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Chandler completed the course first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This round didn't result in any lost lives.

### Laser Maze 4: Jumping Obstacle

This course required contestants to jump over a series of lasers onto a padded surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Penalty**: Hitting any laser, including the top one, resulted in losing a life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: Chris, Chandler, and Karl all lost a life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Nolan successfully completed it without losing a life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Life Count Update**: Karl and Chris were left with only one life remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Nolan still had two lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

### Laser Maze 5: Advanced & Handcuffed

[[MrBeast's role and interactions | MrBeast]] brought in LazarBeam to help design this "hard" course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Special Rule**: Two contestants were handcuffed together by Landon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Karl and Chandler were paired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: Nolan and Chris successfully navigated the course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Karl and Chandler also passed the course without losing a life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
*   **Prize for Sibling**: The first person to complete this stage would win $10,000 for their sibling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Nolan rushed through the course and immediately won the $10,000 for his sister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, but he touched a laser, losing a life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Revealed Mechanic**: [[MrBeast's role and interactions | MrBeast]] then revealed that the lights in the course would have flickered, making it easier to pass without losing a life if Nolan had waited two seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **Life Count Update**: Nolan, Chris, and Karl all had one life left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Chandler remained the only one with two lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Elimination**: Chris lost his last life attempting the flickering laser course, resulting in his elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

## Balance Beam Challenge

Three contestants remained: Nolan, Karl, and Chandler. Their siblings (Chandler's sister, Nolan's sister, and Karl's brother) were brought in to watch them compete on iPads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. The challenge required them to cross a wobbly balance beam without falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **Penalty**: Falling off the beam resulted in losing a life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: Chandler fell and lost a life, leaving him with one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Nolan successfully crossed the beam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Karl also fell off, losing his last life and being eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

## Final Stage: Stool Challenge

With only Nolan and Chandler remaining, both with one life each, the final [[challenge to win money | challenge]] was presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. They had to reach the diamond using only two stools, without touching the floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. The first to grab the diamond would win $100,000 for their sister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: Nolan quickly gained a lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a> and successfully grabbed the diamond first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

## Prize Reveal

After Nolan's victory, [[MrBeast's role and interactions | MrBeast]] revealed that the "diamond" they were competing for was fake, costing only about $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. The real $100,000 diamond was in his pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. The real diamond, along with the $10,000 won earlier, totaling $110,000, was to be shipped to Nolan's sister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. Nolan's sister expressed her excitement and gratitude for the win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

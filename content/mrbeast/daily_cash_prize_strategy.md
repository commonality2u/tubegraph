This article details the strategic approaches employed during a [[challenge_to_win_money | challenge]] where a participant earned a daily cash prize by living inside a grocery store and exchanging store products.

## Challenge Overview
The challenge involved trapping a random individual, Alex, inside a grocery store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The initial offer was $10,000 for every day lived inside the store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This [[challenge_to_win_money | challenge]] had the potential to make Alex a multimillionaire, theoretically allowing him to stay for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The participant was forbidden from crossing a red line painted around the perimeter of the store, or the challenge would end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Numerous cameras were used to ensure compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Winning Mechanics and Rules
After 24 hours, Alex received his first $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. A key twist was then introduced: to receive the daily $10,000, Alex needed to provide $10,000 worth of product from the store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This required him to [[winning_strategies | strategize]] which items to "sell" to stay in the store as long as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. All items sold by Alex were donated to charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Alex's Strategies for Longevity and Comfort
Alex's [[winning_strategies | strategies]] evolved throughout his stay:

*   **Initial Product Selection**
    *   On day one of the new rule, Alex chose expensive electronics, like TVs, noting they were not useful for consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
    *   He also prepared to sell items he couldn't eat, such as pet food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
    *   In the following days, he sold perishable produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, diapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, and other products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
    *   Later, he efficiently used gift cards to reach the $10,000 mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
    *   When the power went out, he prioritized selling frozen foods to prevent spoilage, demonstrating adaptability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

*   **Establishing a Living Space**
    *   Alex designated a corner of the store as his "home base" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
    *   He discovered the backroom of the store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
    *   He constructed a makeshift shower and laundry system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, upgrading it with shelves and plastic liner for waterproofing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
    *   He built walls for his shelter using water bottles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a> and later reinforced his house with metal shelves after selling the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
    *   He created a comfortable bed using toilet paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, later upgrading it further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

*   **Maintaining Morale and Efficiency**
    *   To combat boredom, Alex built a "cheeseball wall" and enjoyed knocking it down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
    *   He utilized a forklift from the back of the store to increase his efficiency in moving products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
    *   He found and lit lanterns to provide light after the power was cut off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.
    *   To cope with isolation, he brought a cardboard cutout of the host, Jimmy, to "watch" him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
    *   He opened a dock door to let in daylight and fresh air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
    *   He set up a swimming pool using a found pool and hose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

*   **Financial Goals and Personal Considerations**
    *   Initially, Alex's goal was to reach a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
    *   However, he started documenting what he would spend the money on and realized he was missing time with his family, particularly his sons' birthdays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
    *   He adjusted his goal to at least $500,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
    *   A surprise visit from his family reinforced his desire to leave, especially as his children were growing quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## Conclusion
Alex's stay ended after 45 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. He walked away with $450,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>, reaching his revised financial target and prioritizing family time.

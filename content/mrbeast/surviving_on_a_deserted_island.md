Surviving 24 hours on a deserted island might sound like an adventure, but it comes with its own set of challenges and unexpected fun. This article explores the experiences and [[survival_strategies_on_a_deserted_island | survival strategies]] employed by a group of YouTubers during their brief yet intense island escapade.

## Setting Up Camp

Upon their arrival on the deserted island, with no inhabitants and devoid of any cellular service, the adventurers were tasked with setting up camp. The essentials they brought included tents, chairs, some snacks like Doritos, and less conventional supplies like a Barbie Easy-Bake oven and a copy of Fortnite Monopoly to pass the time. 

The absence of modern conveniences such as phone service was emphasized, reinforcing the isolation and emphasizing their reliance on one another for support and survival [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">00:00:34</a>].

## The Treasure Hunt

In a bid to spice up their time on the island, a [[finding_and_burying_treasure | hidden treasure]] hunt was devised. A treasure chest filled with $3,000 in $1 bills was secretly buried at the camp. The treasure hunt not only provided incentive and excitement but also demonstrated that resourcefulness and teamwork were pivotal in solving the mystery of the hidden treasure [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">00:00:57</a>].

Shelter construction was a prominent task on the island. Despite the limited resources, makeshift tents were erected.

One of the most significant survival challenges was making a fire and preparing food. Despite their isolation, the group managed to cook hot dogs, albeit with some struggles.

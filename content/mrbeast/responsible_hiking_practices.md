When undertaking a hike, especially in challenging environments like mountains, it is important to follow specific guidelines to ensure a positive impact on the land and a safe experience for all participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42:00">[14:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>.

## Key Guidelines for Responsible Hiking
Every action during a hike can have an impact on the natural environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>. Hikers are encouraged to ensure these impacts are positive rather than negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>.

To practice [[importance_of_environmental_responsibility | environmental responsibility]] while hiking, it is recommended to:
*   Stay on designated trails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>.
*   Follow all established regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>.
*   Avoid damaging or defacing any vegetation, rocks, or other natural resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>.

## [[dealing_with_wildlife_and_the_environment | Interaction with Wildlife]]
When encountering wildlife, it is crucial to maintain a respectful distance:
*   Stay clear of all wildlife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:00">[14:53:00]</a>.
*   Never feed animals, as this can affect their natural actions and behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:00">[14:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:00">[14:56:00]</a>.

While hiking, it is possible to encounter animals like raccoons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>, bears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>, and ducks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>. Adhering to these principles helps preserve the natural habitat and the well-being of the animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>.

The "Last to Take Hand Off Private Jet" challenge features eleven YouTubers competing to win a $2.5 million private jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The core rule is simple: the last person to keep their hand on the jet wins, and anyone who removes their hand is eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Participants are prohibited from pushing each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This [[youtuber_competition_challenges | YouTuber competition challenge]] tests endurance, strategy, and mental fortitude.

## Initial Strategies and Eliminations

Upon starting the challenge, contestants immediately began forming [[contestant_competition_strategies | strategies]]. Many focused on finding the most comfortable or "best spot" on the plane, such as the lowest part or near the wheels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Despite initial confidence and declarations of being able to "stay here forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, the physical and mental strain quickly became apparent.

The first elimination occurred with Vik, who visibly lifted his hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Subsequently, Chunkz considered leaving, leading to an [[interpersonal_dynamics_and_reactions_during_contests | interpersonal dynamic]] where he was offered a debit card with a $10,000 spending limit to exit the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This offer, however, led to an unexpected double elimination: Speed was eliminated by high-fiving Chunkz, causing his hand to come off the jet, effectively making Speed "leave for nothing" while Chunkz gained $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. These early exits highlighted the mix of physical endurance and strategic manipulation within the [[competition_dynamics_in_endurance_challenges | competition dynamics in endurance challenges]].

## Escalating Difficulties

To intensify the [[youtuber_competition_challenges | challenge dynamics]], the host introduced several difficulty increasing mechanisms:
*   **Jet Movement** The jet was moved around the airport, forcing contestants to walk and endure physical discomfort while maintaining hand contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Bathroom Method** A "bucket method" was introduced for bathroom breaks, requiring contestants to maintain hand contact while peeing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **In-Cabin Migration** Contestants were made to move inside the jet to specific seating, which proved challenging for some, with one participant crawling on the carpet to maintain contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Seating Reduction** Once inside, the host announced that one seat was needed for himself to fly the plane, pressuring a contestant to voluntarily leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. This led to Will accepting a 20K offer from the other contestants to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Fake Flight** The jet took off, and contestants experienced turbulence and uncertainty about their destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This segment also saw a contestant eliminated for touching the interior of the jet, rather than the exterior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. After over an hour in the air, it was revealed they had only flown in circles and landed back at the same hangar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>, a major prank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Difficult Meals** Contestants were provided meals like spaghetti and steak, which were intentionally hard to eat with only one hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

## Alliances and Moral Dilemmas

As the competition progressed and the number of contestants dwindled to five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>, [[team_dynamics_and_alliances_in_competitions | team dynamics and alliances]] began to emerge. Contestants were asked to pair up and tape their hands together, forcing closer [[friendship_and_competition_dynamics | friendship and competition dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This bonding led to moments of shared struggle and comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

The challenge also explored [[emotional_dynamics_in_competitions | emotional dynamics in competitions]] and moral considerations regarding the prize. Contestants discussed who they would give the private jet to if they won, with reasons ranging from family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a> to their editor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>, and even using it to help someone who recovered from leukemia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

## Final Stages and Conclusion

As the challenge wore on into the early morning hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>, further restrictions were added:
*   **Red Tape Boundary** A red line was placed on the jet, and touching or going below it resulted in elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Coin Flip Exits** Two contestants used coin flips to decide their fate. Callux agreed that if he lost a coin flip, he would take his hand off the jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Later, another contestant offered to coin flip to remove his tape, with the condition that if he lost, he would leave the competition entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
*   **Single Finger Rule** To heighten the difficulty, remaining contestants were eventually required to maintain contact using only a single pointer finger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>, significantly increasing the physical strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   **Orientation Change** Contestants were made to face a specific direction, further challenging their stability and comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

The challenge concluded with a dramatic reveal. While a contestant was shown footage suggesting they had lost by a single frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>, it was later revealed to be a troll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. Harry ultimately won the private jet, enduring the full length of the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. He decided to give the jet to his brother and sister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. The carbon emissions from the video's filming and the jet's future use were pledged to be offset tenfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

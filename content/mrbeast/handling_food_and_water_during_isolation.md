During a seven-day [[challenges_of_isolation_and_confinement | isolation]] challenge stranded on a raft in the middle of the ocean, five individuals faced significant challenges regarding their food and water supply.

## Initial Supplies
The raft was equipped with a crate containing enough food for all five participants for seven days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Their entire water supply for the seven-day period was stored in two barrels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Daily Consumption and Challenges
From the start, the water presented issues, described as "very hot" and containing "dirt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. By day three, approximately 36 hours into the challenge, almost half of one water barrel had been consumed, leading to a prediction that they would run out of water by day six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This realization prompted an idea to explore additional food sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

## Seeking Additional Resources
Noticing many fish beneath the raft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, the group attempted to [[finding_food_and_resources_in_the_wild | catch some dinner]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. However, after hours of trying, they caught "absolutely nothing," finding [[finding_food_and_resources_in_the_wild | fishing]] much harder than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## Rations and Cooking
Feeling tired, dehydrated, and hungry, they were forced to delve into their prepared rations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Their supplies included wood to build a fire and pans for cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. They managed to cook canned chili with added tomatoes and kidney beans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This marked their first hot meal in days and was greatly appreciated, though it consumed a significant portion of their rations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

## Contamination and Shortages
On day four, an accidental dropping of a ladle into the drinking water led to contamination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. As they hadn't showered in four days, this action rendered a third of their water supply unsafe to drink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

After a severe storm, their fire pit became drenched, preventing them from starting a fire for dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Furthermore, all their food became completely soaked, meaning only a portion remained safe to eat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. By the fifth day, they were [[the_importance_of_water_and_food_in_survival | running out of food]] and their water was contaminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

## End-of-Challenge Status
As the challenge neared its end, the participants deeply appreciated basic amenities. They expressed missing food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a> and a working toilet, vowing never to poop in a bucket again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. To celebrate making it this far, they shared a Feastables bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

Upon being stranded on a deserted island for seven days, the cast immediately focused on establishing [[setting_up_camp_and_creating_shelter | living conditions]] and [[setting_up_camp_and_creating_shelter | shelter]]. Their initial efforts aimed for basic survival and comfort, which evolved significantly as the challenge progressed.

## Day 1: Initial Setup and Discomfort
The first priority upon arrival was to [[setting_up_camp_and_creating_shelter | build a shelter]] within four hours before dark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. They decided to set up camp at a promising spot and began gathering wood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. While some members searched for wood, others prepped the camp, including creating a fire pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> and constructing a basic frame for a [[building_shelters_in_harsh_conditions | shelter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

The initial camp setup was simple, featuring a fire area for cooking and a designated sleeping area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. They also retrieved a survival crate containing food, water, and a flare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Despite these efforts, initial [[daily_life_and_activities_in_harsh_conditions | living conditions]] were tough, with sunburn setting in by the end of Day 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a> and a poor night's sleep due to tossing and turning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Day 2: Upgrading Shelter and Comfort
The main objective for Day 2 was to significantly improve [[living_conditions_in_extended_isolation | living conditions]] by [[building_shelters_in_harsh_conditions | building a bigger and rain-proof shelter]], creating more comfortable seats, and establishing a better fire pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

To achieve this, they sought long, sturdy sticks to create a sloped roof for the [[building_shelters_in_harsh_conditions | shelter]], ensuring rain would flow off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. They also found an ocean buoy that could serve as a bouncy seat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The shelter was upgraded to provide more shade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

A concern arose regarding water consumption, as they had used four out of ten cartons by Day 2, prompting a discussion about responsible water usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Showering was done in the ocean to conserve drinking water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

Despite the shelter upgrades, the second night was worse than the first due to an island-wide infestation of biting bugs, leading to severe discomfort and lack of sleep for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Day 5: Exploration and Renewed Challenges
By Day 5, their morning routine involved complaining about bad sleep, using the bathroom, and eating bagged meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

Later in the day, a spontaneous adventure to explore ruins on top of a mountain led to further challenges. Before the climb, they ensured some of their water bottles were filled with coconut water to [[improving_access_to_clean_water | conserve fresh water]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. Upon returning from the ruins, they found their camp cleaned up, the [[building_shelters_in_harsh_conditions | shelter]] reinforced for rain, and more coconut water prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.

However, a storm hit that night. Despite earlier efforts to improve the [[building_shelters_in_harsh_conditions | shelter]], water began pooling on the roof, raising concerns about its structural integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. The heavy rain led to a damaged shelter, soaking wet beds, and prolonged discomfort, preventing sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.

## Day 6: Mental and Physical Decline and Revival
The morning after the storm was an "all time low," with participants feeling cold, miserable, tired, and sick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>. The repetitive bagged food and constant exposure to the elements began to take a toll on their mental and physical health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>.

To combat the declining morale and [[living_conditions_in_extended_isolation | miserable living conditions]], they took drastic measures by treating themselves to canned peach cobbler for breakfast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. This unorthodox breakfast helped to boost their spirits and restore some normalcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>, allowing them to find fun in their [[daily_life_and_activities_in_harsh_conditions | daily activities]].

## Final Night and Departure
On their final night, Day 6, they celebrated with a massive fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. As the sun rose on Day 7, they broke down their [[setting_up_camp_and_creating_shelter | camp]] and cleaned up, eagerly anticipating their departure from the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.

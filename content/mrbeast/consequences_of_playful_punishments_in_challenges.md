In challenges where participants fail specific tasks, a primary method of [[punishments_in_games | punishment]] involves being pelted by water balloons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This consequence is applied immediately after a participant fails to meet the challenge's criteria, such as missing more than two questions on a test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Specific Instances and Reactions

### Chandler's Failure in Second Grade
When Chandler failed second grade, he was subjected to the water balloon punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. His fellow participants engaged in [[friend_dynamics_during_challenges | playful teasing]], saying "sorry you're bad at second grade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a> and referring to him as "the weakest link" who had been "held back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Chandler jokingly claimed he was "trying to get two wrong on purpose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, but his fellow participants noted he was "trying to be funny and then you got that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Ethan's Failure in Fifth Grade
Ethan, after failing fifth grade, also faced the water balloon punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. While he expressed being "glad I got hit with water cuz it reminds me of being on my dad's yacht" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, he also noted the physical impact, stating "the water balloons really hurt" and that he had "welts on my back now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Despite the pain, he conveyed pride in making it to fifth grade, surpassing his own expectation of only reaching third grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

### Jimmy's Failure in Seventh Grade
Jimmy, upon failing seventh grade due to a spelling error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, was likewise pelted with water balloons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. He described the physical impact, noting that "some of those balloons don't break on impact and they felt like a baseball" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. He acknowledged his weakness in spelling, stating he "knew that was going to come eventually" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

### Chris's Failure in Eleventh Grade
Chris also experienced the water balloon punishment after failing eleventh grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

## Overall Impact
The [[punishments_in_games | playful punishments]], particularly the water balloons, serve as a clear consequence for failure within the game's rules. While the context is lighthearted, participants reported real physical discomfort and acknowledged their personal shortcomings leading to their elimination from the challenge. The act of punishment also reinforces the [[social_dynamics_in_group_challenges | social dynamics]] within the group, highlighting who is "held back" and who progresses.

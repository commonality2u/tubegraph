A real-life scaled replica of the house from the video game *Hello Neighbor 2* was constructed to investigate the effects of a meteor strike on a building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28">[04:28]</a>.

## Experiment Setup
To determine the safest hiding spots, realistic mannequins resembling the boys were created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33">[04:33]</a>. Participants were instructed to place their mannequins anywhere within the house they believed would offer the best chance of survival against a meteor impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36">[04:36]</a>.

Examples of hiding spots included:
*   Inside a car trunk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47">[04:47]</a>.
*   On a couch, with a pillow intended to cushion the fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49">[04:49]</a>.

## Meteor Strikes
Multiple meteors were dropped onto the replica house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07">[05:07]</a>.

### First Impact
The first meteor was dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01">[05:01]</a>, showcasing the initial damage a meteor can inflict on a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10">[05:10]</a>. Karl's mannequin, surprisingly, did not fall after this impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09">[05:09]</a>.

### Second Impact
A second meteor, this time set on fire, was deployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33">[05:33]</a>. After this strike, Chris's mannequin remarkably survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53">[05:53]</a>, while Chandler's mannequin did not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58">[05:58]</a>. The meteor continued to smoke after impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50">[05:50]</a>.

### Third Impact
The final meteor was raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00">[06:00]</a> and subsequently dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04">[06:04]</a>. Following this impact, the speaker's mannequin survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14">[06:14]</a>, but Karl's mannequin did not make it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14">[06:14]</a>.

The experiment aimed to provide insights into potential survival strategies during a meteor impact on a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20">[06:20]</a>.

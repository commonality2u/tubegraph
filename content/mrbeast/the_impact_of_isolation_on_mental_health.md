Being stranded on a deserted island for seven days presented significant [[challenges_of_isolation | challenges]] for the participants, impacting both their physical well-being and their [[the_psychological_and_emotional_challenges_of_isolation | mental health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.

## Initial Struggles and Physical Discomfort

From the outset, the participants were acutely aware of their isolation, being stranded on an island where "civilization has not been able to survive for over 250 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The first night was marked by significant physical discomfort, leading to restless sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a> and a general sense of tiredness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The second night proved even worse, as the island was "infested with bugs that ended up biting us all throughout the night" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, resulting in little to no sleep for some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. One participant described it as "probably the most miserable thing I've ever done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

## Psychological Toll of Prolonged Isolation

As the challenge progressed, the [[psychological_effects_of_isolation | psychological effects of isolation]] became more pronounced:

*   **Boredom and Counterintuitive Actions** By day five, boredom began to set in, leading to seemingly counterintuitive decisions, such as swimming to a small rock in the middle of the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This was recognized as a "testament to just how bored we are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Growing Misery and Desire to Leave** The constant physical struggles, particularly recurring rain during sleep hours, led to increasing misery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. Participants expressed feeling "cold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>, "sick and tired" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>, and a strong desire to "go home" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. The island was described as "sucks a lot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a> and the experience as "quickly turning into a little bit of a nightmare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>.
*   **Decline in Mental State** After six days of physical exertion, the participants' [[psychological_effects_of_isolation | mental health]] visibly deteriorated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>. The monotony of "bagged food" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a> and "hours you can lay in the sun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a> led to feelings of fatigue and headaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>, signifying the profound [[impact_of_isolation_on_relationships | psychological impact of isolation]].

## Coping Mechanisms and Rediscovery of Fun

To combat the growing misery, the team resorted to "drastic measures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>, including treating themselves to canned cobbler for breakfast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>. This small indulgence, along with engaging in playful activities like throwing coconuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>, helped to shift their mood and allowed them to "return back to normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. It became clear that survival on day six depended on "having fun with each other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>.

Despite the suffering, the experience was ultimately seen as an adventure filled with "a lot of fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. The participants reflected that they would likely remember the positive moments more than the negative ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. By day seven, the overriding sentiment was a desire to leave the island and "never coming back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>.

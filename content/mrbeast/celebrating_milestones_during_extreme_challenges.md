During [[highstakes_physical_challenges | highstakes physical challenges]], individuals may find moments to celebrate significant milestones, even amidst dire circumstances. This provides a temporary respite from the inherent [[challenges_of_extreme_survival_scenarios | difficulties]] and can offer a psychological boost.

## The Buried Alive Challenge

One such [[survival_challenges | survival challenge]] involved an individual spending seven days buried alive under 20,000 pounds of dirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This act was described by the participant as "the scariest thing I have ever done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> and "extremely dangerous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, often considered "most people's worst fear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The participant was trapped inside a coffin-like structure, entrusting their life to its integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Throughout the challenge, the participant faced numerous [[unexpected_events_and_complications_during_the_challenge | complications]], including back pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, extreme boredom leading to punching the coffin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, and the constant presence of friends trying to annoy him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, which also highlighted elements of [[team_dynamics_and_humor_in_long_challenges | team dynamics and humor]].

### Personal Milestones

Despite the severity of the situation, the participant acknowledged a personal milestone by crossing the 50-hour mark, meaning they had been buried longer than in a previous attempt at the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Maintaining physical activity, such as digging a hole and using light dumbbells, was crucial to prevent blood clots, which could be fatal after prolonged inactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

### Celebrating 200 Million Subscribers

The most significant milestone celebrated during the challenge was the YouTube channel reaching 200 million subscribers.
Initially, the participant's friends informed him of the impending achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, noting he would reach it "in that coffin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Despite feeling "pretty terrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>, the thought of hitting 200 million subscribers made the participant "kind of happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

To observe the milestone live, the team employed a creative solution, hacking a Verizon 5G Home Internet connection to work underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, allowing the participant to see the real-time subscriber count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

The moment the channel hit 200 million subscribers was met with excitement from both the participant and his team members above ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. This provided a moment of shared joy and reflection on the journey, acknowledging the growth from "just some random dude in Nebraska" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a> to achieving such a massive following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. The participant expressed immense gratitude to his viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

### Post-Celebration and Challenge Completion

While the immediate celebration provided a temporary uplift, the participant soon felt the weight of his isolation again, stating, "now I'm just alone and trapped in here again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. He struggled with mental agony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a> and a lack of motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

Upon completing the full seven days, the participant was finally dug out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. Seeing sunlight after a week underground brought tears to his eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. His first time standing in a week resulted in weak legs and a rush of blood to his head, but he did not experience blood clots as feared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

The ultimate celebration of 200 million subscribers, "the right way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>, occurred above ground with a large crowd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>, marking both the end of the extreme challenge and the achievement of a monumental milestone.

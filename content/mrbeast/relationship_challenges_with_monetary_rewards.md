A unique [[relationship_challenges_in_confined_spaces | relationship challenge]] was introduced on the MrBeast channel, testing a couple's knowledge of each other with a significant monetary reward at stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. This challenge aimed to assess how well a couple truly knew one another by asking questions that required identical answers.

## Participants

The participants in this challenge were Matt and Elizabeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. They had been together for two years and three months and claimed to know each other "definitely" and "absolutely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Matt had previously planned on proposing to Elizabeth earlier in the year but had lost his job, creating uncertainty about their future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

## Challenge Mechanics

The couple was separated, and each individual was asked questions about their relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. If both Matt and Elizabeth provided the exact same answer to a question, they would receive a "mystery prize" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. The ultimate prize for correctly answering all questions was $15,000 to put towards their wedding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>, serving as a powerful [[incentives_and_motivations_in_challenges | incentive]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## Questions Asked

The questions posed to Matt and Elizabeth included:
*   "Where was your guys first date?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>
    *   Both answered: "Town Common" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   "What is your significant other's middle name?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>
    *   Both answered: "Cerelle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

The final "question" for Matt was to ask Elizabeth to marry him on camera, a decision he had previously discussed and expressed a desire to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## Outcome

Matt successfully proposed to Elizabeth, asking "Elizabeth, will you marry me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Elizabeth accepted, leading to widespread celebration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. As a result, the couple won the mystery prize of $15,000 towards their wedding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

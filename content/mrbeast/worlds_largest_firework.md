The total amount spent on fireworks for the video exceeded $600,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Specifications
*   **Cost**: $160,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>

## Launching Process
To launch the firework, a control panel needed to be turned on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, followed by turning a key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. The final step was to press the designated launch button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. For [[firework_safety_and_effects | safety]], participants were positioned 2,000 feet away from the launch site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

## Effects
The firework's explosion was incredibly loud, and its shockwave could be felt in the chest even from 2,000 feet away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. The illumination was so intense it was described as "literally raining fire for like a mile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. The brightness caused some observers to have to back away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

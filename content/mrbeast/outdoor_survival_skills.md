A 24-hour [[survival challenges | challenge]] was undertaken atop one of America's tallest mountains, exceeding 6,000 feet in elevation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The first step was to climb the mountain itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## The Ascent: [[Challenges of extreme survival scenarios | Overcoming Obstacles]]

The climb took place on the Grandfather Trail, marked with a blue diamond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Participants faced multiple [[challenges of extreme survival scenarios | obstacles]], including climbing rocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> and navigating steep sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, with some expressing fear of heights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

### Physical Demands

The hike was physically demanding, with one participant feeling their legs after an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, and later stated they had been walking for over three hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. The oxygen was noted as "incredibly thin" at altitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, requiring deep breaths to avoid lightheadedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Multiple ladders were encountered on the trail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Navigational Difficulties

The group briefly took a wrong turn, finding a deep drop-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. One section required rock climbing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Despite the difficulty, the views improved with altitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. The final approach to the specific camping mountain involved descending one mountain and ascending another, a four-hour hike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Establishing Camp: [[Survival strategies and making a routine | High-Altitude Stay]]

Upon reaching the peak, a campsite was established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The air was thin, with clouds observed on the campsite itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

### [[Resource management in survival situations | Resource Management]]: Water

A significant oversight occurred with water [[resource management in survival situations | resources]]. Participants drank a lot of water during the ascent, leading to a shortage at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. A "special ops team" was dispatched to find a spring located one mile away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. They located a "black forest pipe" delivering clean-tasting water, which they gathered before returning to camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

### [[Improvisation and resourcefulness in survival situations | Food Preparation]]

With Chris, the apparent "Boy Scout" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a> and [[survival tactics | survival expert]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, away fetching water, other team members attempted to set up a grill for cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This involved some humorous missteps, such as initially placing cardboard under the grill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. They eventually used a rock for the grill and lit a fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Food was found in Chris's backpack, specifically SpaghettiOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, which were heated on the fire using a sock to handle the hot can <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

### [[Using technology for assistance in the wilderness | Unexpected Assistance]]

Despite being on a mountain, a Domino's pizza was ordered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. A delivery person, Mike, undertook a six-hour hike to deliver the pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The pizza arrived just as it was getting dark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

### Overnight Conditions

Tents were set up for sleeping, with temperatures expected to drop as low as 45 degrees Fahrenheit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. The thin air and threat of bear attacks were noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>, though no bears were encountered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. Upon waking, the group was out of food and low on water, necessitating their descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

## Lessons Learned: Ethical [[survival tactics | Wilderness]] Engagement

While hiking can be enjoyable, it's important to:
*   Stay on designated trails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
*   Follow all regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.
*   Never damage or deface vegetation, rocks, or natural resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.
*   Stay clear of wildlife and never feed them, as it affects their natural actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

Every action in the [[survival in the wilderness | wilderness]] has an impact on the land, and positive impacts are encouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

A sticky note prank involves covering a target's house with numerous sticky notes as part of a larger, elaborate prank [00:00:08]. This particular prank was designed as a "prank inception," where the individual carrying out the sticky note prank was unknowingly the target of an even larger counter-prank [00:00:14].

## The Prank's Conception
The idea for the sticky note prank originated when the prankster, CJ, planned to cover Karl's house with sticky notes [00:00:08]. This plan served as the catalyst for MrBeast's counter-prank: filling CJ's house with [[using_elephant_toothpaste_in_pranks | elephant toothpaste]] [00:00:14].

## Execution and Misdirection
CJ believed he was pranking Karl by covering his house with sticky notes [00:01:22]. To prevent spoiling Karl's video, a cover story was maintained, making Karl believe that Brady's house was the target of the sticky note prank [00:02:17]. CJ and his crew filmed the process of sticky noting [00:02:37]. They started with the interior of the house, intending to cover the exterior last [00:03:00]. During the process, they encountered issues with sticky notes falling down and running out of supplies [00:02:45].

## The Reveal and Reaction
Karl was eventually brought to the house being sticky noted, and it was revealed that his own house was the target, not Brady's [00:05:11]. Karl expressed surprise, stating he "genuinely didn't see that coming" [00:05:32]. He also humorously declared, "I hate you, both brothers, I hate both brothers now" [00:05:38]. He noted that the sticky notes could "easily come off," unlike the more damaging [[pranking_brothers_with_elephant_toothpaste | elephant toothpaste]] prank inflicted on CJ's house [00:08:52]. As a consequence for pranking Karl, CJ was expected to compensate him, and indeed left him some money [00:08:45].

Being stranded on a raft in the middle of the ocean for seven days presents significant [[survival_challenges_at_sea | survival challenges at sea]], heavily impacted by weather and wildlife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The raft was literally countless miles from the nearest civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Environmental Challenges

### Rain and Storms
The castaways picked "the worst day to start" their challenge, as clouds indicated an impending storm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Continuous rain made the experience "brutal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

On day two, a major rainstorm began right as building commenced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. The shelter proved to be not waterproof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>, leading to water everywhere inside the structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. One castaway described it as "the most insane night yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, with the storm reaching a new peak every hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. The rain persisted for about 20 hours straight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

### Extreme Heat and Sun Exposure
Early in the challenge, the risk of sunburn necessitated building shade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Later in the challenge, conditions shifted dramatically from shivering cold to "scorching hot, unbelievably hot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. The deck became too hot to walk on for the majority of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

### Rough Seas and Seasickness
The constant swaying of the raft made sleeping impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a> and caused [[dealing_with_seasickness | seasickness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, leading to feelings of nausea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a> and potential vomiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## Wildlife Encounters
### Birds
A bird, named Bryan, visited the raft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The castaways joked about it catching fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Bryan left after the first night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, but returned on day five, bringing its family to say goodbye on the last day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.

### Fish
Numerous fish were visible below the raft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, prompting attempts to catch them for dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Despite hours of effort, no fish were caught, proving fishing to be "a lot harder than YouTube" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

### Whales
During construction of the shelter, the castaways spotted whales, describing the sight as "insane" and "unreal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

### Jellyfish
One castaway was stung by a jellyfish while swimming to cool off, leading to "welts and some red lines" on their leg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

## Impact on Supplies and Well-being
The water supply, initially stored in two barrels for five people for seven days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, became hot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a> and later contaminated when a ladle dropped into it after days without showering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. This meant a third of their water was no longer safe to drink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

The storm also drenched their fire pit, making it impossible to start a fire for cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Most of their food was also soaked, leaving only a portion safe to eat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

The challenges of the environment made the experience "miserable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>, with castaways feeling "at rock bottom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> and often dehydrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. They felt this challenge was harder than their previous "[[surviving_50_hours_in_antarctica | Antarctica]]" or "desert" videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, and arguably the hardest challenge they had ever done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

## Coping Strategies and Outcomes
To cope with the environmental challenges, the castaways had a raft equipped with wood, rope, and other materials to build a shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Their initial objective was to set up a structure for shade and coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. After the first night's rough sleep, they aimed to build a "permanent weatherproof shelter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Despite the difficulties, including [[dealing_with_seasickness | seasickness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, they worked together to build walls for their structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. After the major storm, they made efforts to rebuild and waterproof their shelter using tarps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. This reinforced, waterproof fortress ultimately proved successful, allowing for a good night's sleep on the final night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

To combat the heat, some castaways went swimming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>, while others used fans for "cold air" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. They also used their beds as makeshift walls to protect from the rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a> and hung up wet items to dry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

The experience made them appreciate basic comforts often taken for granted, such as showers, food, and working toilets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

A group of adults, including Mr. Beast, Chandler, Garrett, Ethan, Bailey, and Chris, embarked on a challenge to go back to school, starting with first grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The objective was to pass each grade up to 12th; if a participant missed more than two questions on any test, they would fail and be punished with water balloons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The last person to fail would win $10,000, or everyone would win if they all reached 12th grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## First Grade Curriculum and Challenges

The first grade curriculum included:
*   **Introductions** The first task involved each participant stating their name and one interesting fact about themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Reading** Students were required to pay close attention while the teacher read a story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Chandler admitted he "didn't get to write down on anything" during this segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Math** Basic mathematical concepts were covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### First Grade Test

The first grade test consisted of 10 questions and had a 10-minute time limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Calculators were not permitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. All participants successfully passed the first grade test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, indicating that this initial academic hurdle was manageable for the adults involved.

### Subsequent Grades and Challenges

While all participants passed first grade, challenges became apparent in later grades, demonstrating the general [[psychological_and_physical_challenges | psychological and physical challenges]] of returning to a school setting as an adult.

*   **Second Grade:** Chandler failed second grade, missing three questions and subsequently facing the water balloon punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. He jokingly claimed he was "trying to get two wrong on purpose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **Fifth Grade:** Garrett and Ethan failed fifth grade, with Ethan only scoring 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Ethan expressed disappointment but also pride in reaching fifth grade, having only expected to get to third <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **Seventh Grade:** Jimmy failed seventh grade, specifically due to a spelling error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. He noted that some water balloons felt like baseballs and caused welts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
*   **Eleventh Grade:** Chris failed eleventh grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

Ultimately, only Bailey made it to 12th grade and successfully passed, winning the $10,000 prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. This highlights the increasing [[challenges_of_isolation | challenges of isolation]] as more participants were eliminated.

A participant undertook a [[buried_alive_challenge | buried alive challenge]], spending seven days entombed under 20,000 pounds of dirt inside a coffin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This experience was described as the "scariest thing" they had ever done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> and "terrifying," representing most people's "worst fear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The participant admitted to severely underestimating the difficulty of the [[buried_alive_challenge | challenge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Confinement and Environment

The participant's life was entrusted to the coffin for seven days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, hoping it wouldn't break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The [[buried_alive_challenge | challenge]] was confirmed to be 100% real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The participant was trapped, knowing they would not be able to stand up for a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Supplies and Safety Protocols

To [[surviving_isolation_in_a_coffin | survive]] the seven days, the participant had:
*   Food: Primarily MREs (Meal Ready to Eat) and snacks in a briefcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. They anticipated running out of food before the seven-day mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. MREs are chemically cooked by adding hot water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   Water: A five-gallon drum of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   Essentials: Additional essentials were provided in another briefcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

The [[buried_alive_challenge | challenge]] was deemed "extremely dangerous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. To prevent suffocation, people were required to watch the participant at all times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. A walkie-talkie was used for communication, with someone needing to be near it at all times to respond to needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Physical and Mental Toll

The [[challenges_of_extreme_survival_scenarios | challenges of extreme survival scenarios]] quickly became apparent:
*   **Immediate Discomfort**: The participant felt the need to urinate shortly after the [[buried_alive_challenge | challenge]] began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, describing the situation as "so uncomfortable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Their foot also went numb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Sleep**: Sleep was considered key to finishing the [[buried_alive_challenge | challenge]] to avoid thinking about being trapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, and the goal was to sleep as much as possible for sanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. However, friends often interrupted his sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Towards the end, he struggled to sleep despite being tired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Boredom**: Extreme boredom led to punching the coffin walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, even putting a sock on his hand to continue punching when his knuckles hurt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Physical Ailments**: The participant experienced back pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. To prevent blood clots, he was advised by his doctor to move every day, as lying down for seven days straight could be fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. He used small dumbbells for exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Hygiene**: The participant frequently had to urinate. After exhausting his pee bottles, he resorted to using meal bags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a> and even cut off the "infected" part of his shorts after an accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. He noted that he smelled bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Emotional Distress**: The participant started crying multiple times without understanding why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. He felt depressed and lacked motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, eventually having "zero desire to speak" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. He described the experience as a "nightmare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a> and felt like he was losing his mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

## External Interactions and Pranks

His friends frequently interacted with him from above ground:
*   **Initial Annoyance**: They made loud noises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a> and grilled steaks on top of his "grave" while he ate MREs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Surgical Camera**: Friends stuck a pipe down to his coffin, vacuumed dirt, and fed a surgical wire camera down to observe him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Rain and Concerns**: Heavy rain and thunder caused concern among the friends about the dirt becoming heavier and potentially crushing the coffin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Vibrations and Music**: They used 15 speakers on top of the grave to play music and cause vibrations, causing the coffin to shake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, which caused headaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. They also noticed an unscrewed bolt in the coffin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   **Tunnel Digging**: Friends dug a tunnel to the coffin, using blaring construction noises to mask their digging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. They eventually reached the coffin to communicate directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   **Nolan's Mom Photo**: A photo of Nolan's mom was taped inside the essential briefcase, which the participant found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This became a running joke, with the participant refusing to give it back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Later, Nolan's parents were brought to the grave to cheer the participant up by sharing embarrassing stories about Nolan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
*   **Paintball**: Friends engaged in paintball on his tombstone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

## 200 Million Subscriber Celebration

While buried, the team approached 200 million subscribers. They used a hacked Verizon 5G home internet connection to allow the participant to watch the real-time subscriber count from underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. The participant expressed gratitude for reaching this milestone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. The channel hit 200 million subscribers while he was still in the coffin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

## The Final Day and Emergence

On the final day, the participant was incredibly excited, tearing up at the thought of seeing sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. His main concern was whether he would be able to stand without dying from blood clots after lying down for so long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

An excavator was brought in to dig him out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. As dirt was removed, sunlight became visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. He started crying again upon seeing the sun after seven days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.

A medic was present to assess his condition before he stood up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. Upon standing for the first time in a week, his legs felt weak, and he experienced a "rush of blood to [his] head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. After emerging, he was met by many people, allowing him to celebrate the 200 million subscriber milestone properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.

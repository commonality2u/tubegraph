The challenge of 100 kids competing against 100 adults for a share of half a million dollars highlighted various [[emotional_dynamics_in_competitions | emotional dynamics]] between the two groups, both within and across team lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The prize money was to be split among remaining players on the winning team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Competition and Rivalry

From the outset, a strong sense of rivalry was evident:
*   Kids vehemently denied the possibility of losing to adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   Adults similarly rejected the idea of being beaten by kids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

As the challenge progressed, these [[emotional_aspects_of_competition | emotional aspects of competition]] became more pronounced:
*   Early departures caused dismay among the remaining team members, with one kid expressing, "How y'all gonna leave, and leave us with like 88 adults?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Another noted, "A lot of people just left. I don't how to feel about that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   A kid attempting to discover the number of adults left was accused of cheating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   Team members found encouragement in the difficulties faced by the opposing side, with one kid remarking, "More money for us as soon as they leave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   The overall mood of the teams was often tied to their perceived performance, with one adult stating, "Oh, I think we're losing by a lot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   The adults celebrated their victory over the kids with chants and excitement at the challenge's conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

## Intergenerational Support and Connection

Despite the competition, moments of intergenerational connection and support were observed, particularly between parents and their children:
*   Adults were required to sign a document ensuring that if the kids won, the parents would not use the prize money for themselves, to which the kids reacted with surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   When contestants were offered money to leave, one instance saw both a father and son depart, leading to the observation, "it's like father, like son" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   A pipe was provided to allow kids to communicate with their parents, leading to excited greetings, expressions of missing each other, and encouragement like "stay strong, stay away from the red line. I love you, Buddy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   The kids' teacher received a monetary gift because they named her as their favorite, indicating the positive influence of an adult figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. The teacher, in turn, offered the kids no homework for the rest of the year if they won, further strengthening the connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   At the end of the challenge, children sought out their parents for hugs and emotional reunions, with expressions of pride and love such as "Oh my god, you did it Buddy!" and "I knew you could do it!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

## Reactions to Pressure and Temptation

The [[friendship_dynamics_in_highstress_challenges | dynamics during high-stress challenges]] and [[emotional_effects_of_longterm_challenges | long-term confinement]] also played a role:
*   Participants struggled with boredom, leading kids to dismantle floor tiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   Temptations like leaving for a small amount of money (e.g., $1000) or for desired food (Taco Bell, coffee) tested the resolve of both groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   A prank involving an empty briefcase or a single dollar bill was designed to test the participants' reactions to temptation, with the kids demonstrating more skepticism than some adults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. One adult leaving for an empty briefcase was seen as "embarrassing" by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   As the space shrunk, participants acknowledged the increased stress: "It's about to get real stressful up in here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

## The 40 Millionth Subscriber's Grand Prize

To commemorate the [[100_million_subscribers_milestone | 40 million subscriber milestone]], the creator decided to give away 40 cars to their 40 millionth subscriber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The recipient, Luke, was selected from YouTube's list of most recent subscribers the moment the milestone was hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Initially told only that he had a surprise awaiting him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, Luke had no idea he would receive 40 cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The collection included a Porsche, a Chrysler, a custom-wrapped Tesla, and even a SpongeBob car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

Upon the reveal, Luke was clearly overwhelmed and surprised, exclaiming, "Whoa, dude, dude. No way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Spreading the Wealth: A Community Challenge

Rather than keeping all 40 cars, Luke was presented with a [[challenges_for_subscribers_to_win_money | challenge]]: if he could give away all 40 cars within 24 hours, he would win the custom-wrapped Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This [[tesla_challenge_for_subscriber | Tesla challenge for subscriber]] Luke transformed the individual gift into a widespread act of generosity within his community.

Luke immediately began distributing cars to:
*   **Family Members:** His brother Jake received the first car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. His parents also picked a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, and his great aunt received one of her own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Later, his other grandparents drove for hours to receive a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   **Friends:** Luke texted his friends to come and get cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, resulting in friends like Carson receiving a Subaru <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Community Members:** Luke extended his generosity beyond his immediate circle. He gave a car to his dad's employee, Steve, whom he described as a "nice guy" who deserved a good car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **Random Strangers:** Luke sought out random people at Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a> and Zaxby's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>, offering them free cars.

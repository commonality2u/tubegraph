In a thrilling episode filled with daring experiments, the focus was on the exhilarating use of fireworks and dynamite. The team conducted multiple experiments where they utilized explosive materials in a controlled yet exciting manner, aiming to achieve jaw-dropping results.

## The Firework House Experiment

One of the key highlights was the "Firework House" experiment, where an entire house was filled with over 100,000 fireworks. The team had a unique challenge: each member placed a mannequin in strategic locations within the house to test if it was possible for them to "survive" the explosion. Chris chose the bathtub, another opted for the fridge, and other mannequins were placed under the washer and on the front porch [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">00:00:15</a>].

As the countdown reached zero, with a dramatic "Fire in the hole," the house was ignited, resulting in a spectacular display of fireworks that obliterated everything inside, including the mannequins [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">00:00:54</a>]. The house continued burning throughout the night until nothing was left [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">00:01:20</a>].

## The Dynamite Challenge

Following the firework spectacle, the team moved on to another explosive challenge involving dynamite. They surrounded $50,000 with thousands of pounds of TNT, presenting a choice to participant Will. He was tasked with using any materials he desired to [[protecting_money_from_tnt_explosion | protect as much of the $50,000 as possible]] from being destroyed [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">00:02:37</a>].

Will ingeniously bought industrial water containers, mattresses, and built cinder block walls to construct a formidable barrier around the cash [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">00:03:10</a>]. As the experiment progressed, the stakes were raised when Jimmy offered to double both the TNT and the prize money if Will agreed â€” which he did, bringing the total prize to $100,000 [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">00:05:44</a>].

When the dynamite was finally detonated, the explosion was immense. Despite the incredible force, Will's protective strategies paid off, saving over $95,000 from being obliterated [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">00:08:43</a>].

## Conclusion

These experiments showcased not only the thrill and spectacle of fireworks and dynamite but also the creative problem-solving required to conduct such high-stakes experiments safely. Through a combination of excitement and caution, the experiments provided both a visual feast and a lesson in explosive dynamics, ensuring they left a memorable impression on the audience with their [[successful_completion_of_a_highstakes_challenge | successful completion of a high-stakes challenge]].

An extensive collection of Orbeez, totaling [[massive_orbeez_experiment_putting_100_million_orbeez_in_a_backyard | 100 million Orbeez]], was used to create various [[unique_contests_and_games | unique contests and games]] and challenges in a backyard setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The Orbeez were prepared by laying them out on tarps in the backyard, allowing them to grow significantly in size when exposed to rain, as they can get about 30 times bigger with water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The goal was for all [[massive_orbeez_experiment_putting_100_million_orbeez_in_a_backyard | 100 million Orbeez]] to expand and fill the entire backyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## Orbeez-Filled Activities

### Trust Falls
Participants engaged in trust falls into the Orbeez, describing the sensation as being "buried alive" or "laying in macaroni" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. One participant had an immediate panic attack upon falling in, feeling unable to move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

### Orbeez Snorkeling
An attempt was made to snorkel in the Orbeez-filled pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. It was confirmed that snorkels could work as long as the snorkel did not go under the Orbeez, to avoid breathing them in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### Boogie Boarding
A boogie board was used to attempt to glide across the surface of the Orbeez, though this was unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

### Orbeez Pool Race
A [[unique_sporting_challenges | sporting challenge]] was set up where contestants raced to complete two laps in the Orbeez-filled pool for a prize of one thousand dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. One contestant, Chandler, won after offering another participant, Jake, 750 dollars to help him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This showcased a [[creative_ways_to_win_money_or_prizes | creative way to win money or prizes]] in a competition setting.

### Tightrope of Death
A "tightrope of death" challenge was created, where participants had to walk across a rope suspended over the Orbeez <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Failure to complete the walk meant being banished from the land, implying allegiance to "T-Series" over "PewDiePie," a YouTube-related rivalry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Success resulted in "PewDiePie's forgiveness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

### Other Amusements
*   Participants "planted" each other in piles of Orbeez <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   Orbeez were thrown onto firecrackers to observe the effect, resulting in smoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   A "streaker" ran through the Orbeez-filled area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

## Environmental Considerations
The Orbeez used were stated to be [[biodegradability_and_environmental_impact_of_orbeez | biodegradable]] and not harmful to squirrels, with plans to pick them all up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.

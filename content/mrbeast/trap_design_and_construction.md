This article details the various traps constructed for a challenge, focusing on their design, mechanisms, and rules. The traps are progressively harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Trap 1: The Closing Walls
The first trap requires the contestant to break out of a cage and climb onto a roof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The challenge is time-sensitive, as walls equipped with spikes close in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Trap 2: The Laser Grid
This trap features a room filled with lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The objective is to press a red button and return to the starting door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. If a laser is touched, the door slams closed in less than a second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The design anticipates contestants attempting to crawl, with lasers placed straight ahead to counter this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Trap 3: The Rolling Boulder
The set for this trap was designed over 60 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The contestant must grab money and walk down a path to a door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. As soon as the money is picked up, a large boulder rolls towards the contestant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Trap 4: Life-Sized Video Game Course
This trap is constructed as a life-sized video game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>, where the contestant must complete a course while inside a ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Falling into the foam below results in a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. There is a 5-minute time limit to complete the course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. The course begins with platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a> and progressively features "moving platforms of death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. The ball makes balancing and movement more difficult, multiplying movements and increasing the chance of falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Trap 5: Underwater Lock Picking
This trap involves swimming through an underwater chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. The money is pulled towards a massive bonfire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, and the contestant must pull a lever to stop it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. To reach the lever, the contestant must pick the locks of four doors in their path using a clothes hanger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The challenge has a 3-minute time limit before the money reaches the fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Each lock requires deeper underwater travel, reducing the time available for breathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

## Trap 6: Chocolate Bar Choice
This trap is described as the "easiest trap of all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. The contestant simply needs to choose between a Feastables Bar or a Hershey's bar, and dispose of one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

## Trap 7: High-Altitude Balance Beam
The contestant is blindfolded and elevated 200 feet in the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. The challenge is to walk across an "absurdly thin balance beam" to the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

## Trap 8: [[honeycomb_challenge_and_strategies | Honeycomb Challenge]] on a Glass Bridge
This trap combines elements from the [[Squid Game]] television series, including a glass bridge and a cookie cutting game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. The contestant is given a honeycomb and must cut out a specific shape, then place it on a scanner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. If the cookie breaks or doesn't fit, the bridge drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. If successful, a door opens, and the process is repeated for three more shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. Initially, there is no time limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, but a time limit was considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. The shapes included a circle, a triangle, and the more difficult star and umbrella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. The final "umbrella" shape was given a 10-minute timer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. A strategy involved licking the honeycomb to melt the sugar and using a needle to poke through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. The contestant also used money and a shoe as makeshift hammers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

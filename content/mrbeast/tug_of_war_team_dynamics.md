In the Mr. Beast "Squid Game" adaptation, the fourth challenge was a game of Tug of War, where teams faced off on a perilous bridge above a foam pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. The game required not only physical strength but also strategic team formation and cohesion, significantly reducing the number of contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## Team Formation

Prior to the game, the remaining 142 contestants were instructed to split into groups of 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. This self-selection process immediately highlighted various [[team_dynamics_and_strategies|team dynamics and strategies]] among players:

*   **Seeking Strength:** Contestants actively recruited physically imposing individuals, aiming to form the "strongest people" teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. One participant explicitly stated their goal to "recruit the biggest people" to "get real strong and pull the rope" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Balancing Attributes:** Some groups sought a mix of attributes, valuing "intelligence, skill, and brawn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **Exclusionary Tactics:** One team was heard stating, "Sorry, no girls allowed," indicating a focus on perceived physical strength over inclusivity in their team selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **Strategic Consolidation:** Some players actively "sent three people off" to finalize their group of ten, emphasizing a decisive approach to team composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

Ultimately, 12 different groups of 10 people were formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## Matches and Performance

Matches were determined by a random draw, pitting teams against each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Elimination occurred if a team fell into the foam pit or if their flag crossed to the opposing team's side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

*   **Team Five vs. Team Six:** Team Five displayed clear [[competitive_teamwork|competitive teamwork]] with a unified chant: "Team five on three. One two, three, team five" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. They quickly gained the upper hand, with Team Six falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. Despite shouts of "Dig, dig, dig!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>, Team Six was eliminated, and Team Five advanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **Team Two vs. Team Seven:** Team Two showed strong [[competitive_teamwork|competitive teamwork]] and motivation, chanting, "You keep me alive, we're gonna get the money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. They successfully won their match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Team Four vs. Team Ten:** This match highlighted the perceived "plot armor" of players representing characters from the original "Squid Game," specifically player 456, who was on Team Ten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Team Ten, with player 456, ultimately prevailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Mr. Beast noted that "456 and 067 both survived tug of war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **Team Nine vs. Team Eleven:** The intensity of this match was so high that Team Nine and Team Eleven "broke the set" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, demonstrating extreme effort and determination from both sides.

## Outcome

The Tug of War round significantly thinned the numbers, reducing the contestant pool from 120 people down to 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. This game emphasized that successful [[competitive_teamwork|competitive teamwork]] and strategic team composition were crucial for advancing in the competition.

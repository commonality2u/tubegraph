In a recent episode of a popular MrBeast video, viewers were treated to an array of creative games designed to give participants the opportunity to [[unique_games_and_prizes_for_participants | win money and prizes]]. This highlighted how non-traditional approaches to [[creative_ways_to_earn_cash_through_physical_challenges | game design]] can result in not only entertainment but significant winnings for participants. Below, we take a closer look at some of these innovative games.

## The Mystery Decision

One of the opening challenges involved a high-stakes choice between a known prize and a mystery one. Participants were presented with a $38,000 diamond ring or a mystery check whose value was hidden beneath tape. The participant opted for the [[comparing_the_value_of_a_diamond_versus_a_mystery_cheque | known $38,000 value of the ring]], spurning the mystery check which held $100,000. This game was a test of [[decision_making_and_honesty_in_high_stakes_situations | risk tolerance]] and decision-making under uncertainty [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">00:00:11</a>].

## Jelly Beans for Millions

A humorous yet nerve-wracking game involved guessing the number of jelly beans in a vast jar for a chance to win $1 million. The challenge emphasized the element of estimation, [[challenges_involving_guessing_and_precision_for_monetary_rewards | critical thinking under pressure]], and the humorous reality that sometimes fortune is unpredictable [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">00:00:52</a>].

## Solo Cup Stacking

In a seemingly straightforward task, participants were tasked with laying out red solo cups, earning a dollar per cup placed. This game rewarded persistence, [[strategy_and_tactics_for_endurance_challenges | strategic thinking]] about space utilization, and physical stamina as the participant had the entire room and a full day to work with [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">00:01:46</a>].

## Ice Pickaxe Challenge

Another challenge involved breaking into an ice block containing a briefcase with $10,000 using a limited number of swings with a pickaxe. This game required both physical strength and [[strategies_for_overcoming_difficult_obstacles | strategic planning]] in selecting how and where to strike the ice for maximum effect [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">00:02:11</a>].

## Basketball Accuracy

Participants faced a wall of basketball goals, with each successful shot securing an item. The catch, however, was that missing a shot would mean losing all previously won items. This created a thrilling [[competition_among_friends | test of both skill]] and bravery in knowing when to stop [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">00:03:51</a>].

## Bucket Surprise

In a test of intuition and trust, participants stood beneath buckets with unknown contents—mustard, slime, or money. Choices had to be made regarding which bucket to stand under, reminding participants and viewers alike of the [[emotional_journey_and_redemption_in_competition | whims of chance]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">00:06:59</a>].

## Relationship Test

In a heartwarming twist, a couple participated in a game that tested their knowledge of each other. If they correctly matched answers to set questions, they would [[dedication_to_winning_for_a_family_member | win $15,000 toward their wedding]]—highlighting the power of interpersonal knowledge and connection [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">00:08:09</a>].

In various challenges, contestants have utilized a wide array of unconventional materials to protect valuable assets from destruction. This often involves repurposing everyday items or industrial supplies in creative ways to absorb impact, deflect projectiles, or halt massive forces.

## Protecting from Bullets
In one challenge, Blake was tasked with protecting a quarter-million-dollar Lamborghini from 10,000 bullets over 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. His strategy involved layering various materials:
*   **Cinder Blocks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
*   **Shipping Containers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
    *   These were filled with **refrigerators** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
    *   Later, a container was additionally stuffed with a **van and a giant tube** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Cars** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
    *   Initially planned as a wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, they were later placed inside storage containers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Water** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> (used in containers, possibly from a water truck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>)
*   **Concrete** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>
*   **Railroad Ties** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>
Despite initial doubts about the effectiveness of a single shipping container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, Blake's elaborate structure successfully protected the Lamborghini from 10,000 rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This defense is an example of [[construction_and_defense_strategies | construction and defense strategies]].

## Catching a Car from a 100-Foot Drop
For the second phase, Blake had to catch the Lamborghini after it was dropped from a height of 100 feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. His strategy involved creating a soft landing pit using:
*   **CONEXes (Shipping Containers)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>
    *   These were arranged in a square to form the outer structure of the pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Air Mattresses** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a> (Blake bought every air mattress in the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>).
*   **Pillows** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a> (150 pillows were used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>).
*   **Bubble Wrap** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>
*   **Bouncy Castles** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a> (three were used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>).
*   **Cardboard Boxes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a> (2,000 were used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>).
The combination of these materials successfully cushioned the fall, leaving the car with minimal damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

## Deflecting Flaming Cars
To protect the Lamborghini from being crushed and burned by flaming cars dropped from above, Blake designed a non-flammable structure:
*   **Shipping Containers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>
    *   One container had its bottom cut out to surround the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
    *   Two more containers were positioned to form a "V" shape above the car, designed to deflect the falling cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **Dirt** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a> (its purpose was not explicitly stated but was part of the final build).
This design prevented the Lamborghini from being destroyed by the flaming cars, despite the protective container bowing under the impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

## Stopping a Train
The final challenge was to stop a massive train from destroying the Lamborghini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Blake's goal was to derail the train by elevating the tracks:
*   **Railroad Ties** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>
    *   These were tucked under the tracks, designed to lift the train two inches off the track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. Blake explicitly stated these would save him after they caused him to lose a previous challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.
*   **Concrete** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a> (to be placed on top of the railroad ties).
*   **Cars** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a> (those used in Phase 3 were stacked on the tracks).
*   **Shipping Containers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a> (added to the tracks).
*   **Mattresses** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a> (to cushion the impact).
*   **Water Tanks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a> (added to the tracks).
Blake's extensive barrier of unconventional materials successfully derailed the train, saving the Lamborghini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.

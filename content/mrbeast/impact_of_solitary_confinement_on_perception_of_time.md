From: [[mrbeast]] <br/> 

Spending time in a soundproof, white room with zero human contact and zero stimulation for an extended period, such as seven days (168 hours), can severely distort an individual's perception of time and lead to significant [[psychological_effects_of_longterm_confinement | psychological damage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This environment is considered much worse than typical psychiatric hospital settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Initial Stages of Time Distortion

Within the first day of confinement, the subject began to experience a warped sense of time. By what he believed was 14 hours into the challenge, he was already off by 2 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. To further disrupt his ability to gauge time, meals were delivered randomly, with breakfast sometimes arriving at 6 p.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The soundproof nature of the room also meant that food deliveries could go unnoticed for hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

By around 40 hours into the challenge (Day 2), the subject was 6 hours off from the actual time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This [[psychological_impact_of_isolation | loss of sense of time]] led to other problems, including insomnia, as the constant bright lights disrupted his brain's natural sleep cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. The external observers noted that he didn't *need* to sleep but *wanted* to sleep to pass the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Worsening Distortion and Paranoia

As the challenge progressed, the perception of time became increasingly confused:
*   **Meal Confusion** When a second meal arrived, the subject felt only minutes had passed, questioning if he was supposed to eat both, unaware how long the first meal had been sitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This disorientation also led to paranoia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **Sleep as a Coping Mechanism** Sleeping for extended periods, such as 12 hours in the bathroom where it wasn't as bright, helped to [[coping_mechanisms_in_solitary_confinement | pass the time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. However, this strategy also contributed to further disorientation upon waking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

By the halfway mark (84 hours), the subject was off by a full day in his time estimation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

## Advanced Stages: Loss of Reality and Panic

Towards the latter half of the challenge, the **[[psychological_effects_of_longterm_confinement | psychological effects of longterm confinement]]** became severe:
*   **Blending Seconds** "The seconds are starting to blend together, so much. I would try to guess what time it is, but I have no earthly idea. My mind is slowly deforming into stupidity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Dreaming of the Confinement** The subject began to dream about being in the same room, believing it was day six or seven, only to wake up and realize it was a dream and he was still confined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.
*   **Desperate Attempts to Track Time** In an attempt to estimate the remaining time (believing 33 hours were left), he used physiological cues like the number of times he slept (five times), pooped (five times), and the growth of his neck hair (which usually takes a week) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. The thought of it still being day five or even day four was unbearable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **Delusional Beliefs** He mistakenly believed he was sleeping through the final hours of the challenge, only to be hit with the "rude awakening" that it was still 24 hours away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. He refused to believe there were more than 24 hours left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

By the end of the challenge, the subject's perception of time was severely distorted, leading to profound [[psychological_effects_of_isolation | distress]], [[the_impact_of_isolation_on_mental_health | loneliness]], and [[psychological_effects_of_isolation | misery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. He described feeling "dead" and lost all sense of how to interact with other humans immediately after release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. The overwhelming relief upon seeing the outside world and feeling daylight was profound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.

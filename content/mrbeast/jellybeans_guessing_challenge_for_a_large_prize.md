A [[challenge_to_win_money | challenge to win money]] featured a contestant named Joe attempting to guess the number of jelly beans in a large jar for a significant [[games_and_contests_with_highvalue_prizes | prize]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Challenge Setup
The challenge involved a large jar filled with jelly beans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Smoke machines were used to emphasize the epic nature of the setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Rules and Prize
The objective was to guess the exact number of jelly beans in the jar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The prize for a correct guess was $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Contestants were not allowed to remove the lid of the jar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Joe also attempted to call for help via FaceTime, but this was disallowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Outcome
Joe's guess for the number of jelly beans was 72,368 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The actual number of jelly beans in the jar was 8,171 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. As a result, Joe was "way off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a> and did not win the $1 million prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This fell under the category of [[prize_distribution_and_surprise_outcomes | surprise outcomes]] where the prize was not awarded.

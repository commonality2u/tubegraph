The 100-day challenge, where a participant named Shawn had to survive inside a giant circle for $500,000, presented significant [[psychological effects of isolation | psychological and emotional challenges]] beyond mere physical survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Shawn, a husband and father of four, faced the longest period of [[challenges of living in isolation | isolation]] he had experienced in 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

## Initial Adjustments and Mental State

Upon entering the circle, Shawn's immediate strategy included organizing food and clothing, but also figuring out "a way to keep my mind entertained" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. Despite the initial setup, he acknowledged the immense difficulty of the challenge.

> "What do you think the hardest part of this challenge will be?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>
> "Being in my own head." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>

Within the first ten days, Shawn surprisingly developed a routine and showed confidence, even planning to be "jacked" and "ripped" by the end of the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. He also planned to use the money for a solar-powered farm and a vacation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

## Mid-Challenge Struggles

As the challenge progressed, the [[challenges of isolation | challenges of isolation]] began to take a toll.

### External Disruptions and Annoyances
Shawn dealt with practical issues, such as a non-draining shower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a> and water leaking from the ceiling during a tornado watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. Further, visitors from outside the circle caused him frustration, leaving his yard covered in glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. These disruptions added to the stress of his isolated environment.

### The Weight of Loneliness
By day 25, Shawn began to feel the emotional burden of the challenge. He described the competition as a "huge sacrifice," lamenting the limited summers he had with his children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. He also found notes from his youngest daughter in his clothes, intensifying his feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.

> "Rationing food. Survival is gonna be rough, but if anything makes me walk out of here, it's gonna be the [[psychological effects of isolation | loneliness]]." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>

### Father's Day Emotional Impact
Day 39, Father's Day, was particularly difficult. Shawn woke up thinking he was home, missing his family, and anticipating a "tough day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>. His family's surprise visit for the day provided immense emotional relief, almost making the organizers "feel bad for trapping him in here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>. Shawn expressed deep gratitude, stating it "was the best" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.

## Later Stages and Extreme Boredom
Around day 50, Shawn refused an offer of $100,000 to leave, indicating his strong determination to complete the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>. However, the subsequent 30-day period without direct interaction with the organizers heavily impacted him.

Shawn revealed he had "tapped out the things to do inside the 60 foot circle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>. Despite having built a moat, a garden, a fire pit, and a hammock, he reached a point of severe lack of stimulation.

> "So I'm just here existing. I don't feel like doing really anything, so I'm just going to sleep." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>

Upon the organizer's return after 30 days, Shawn visibly appeared thinner, having lost 22 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>. His emotional state was significantly affected, showing relief and excitement at their return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>.

## Final Days: Mental Fortitude vs. Harassment
In the final ten days, the challenges intensified. Shawn's house was cut in half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>, and later partly demolished with a wrecking ball and excavator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:00">[15:09:00]</a>. He also endured various forms of harassment, including loud music from surrounding speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a> and being silently surrounded by clowns for an entire night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>. He characterized these tactics as "emotional damage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>.

Despite being offered a quarter of a million dollars to quit due to the extreme heat, Shawn refused, stating, "I think I'd rather die than give up on this challenge at this point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>. This highlights the immense mental fortitude required to overcome the [[the_impact_of_isolation_on_mental_health | psychological effects of isolation]] and push through the discomfort.

## Conclusion: The Cost of a Challenge
As the final minutes ticked down, Shawn felt the full weight of his experience.

> "Emotions are hitting me pretty heavy right now. Money's the thing we trade our life for. Giving up a third of a year of my life for a half million? Make sure you're trading your life for things that are worth it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>

Shawn successfully completed the 100-day challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>, walking out of the circle to reunite with his family and claim his prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:23:00">[16:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:39:00">[16:39:00]</a>. His journey powerfully illustrates the severe [[psychological impact of isolation | psychological effects of isolation]] and the profound sacrifices one might make for a substantial reward.

The challenge involved flying on various planes, starting with the cheapest available aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Experience Details

The world's cheapest plane is described as "really rickety" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The ticket price was indicated by a single dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The sound of the engine was compared to that of a lawn mower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

Concerns about safety were high, with participants expressing nervousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> and noting that the flight "does not sound safe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The pilot had reportedly flown this type of plane half a dozen times previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### Takeoff and Landing

During takeoff, the plane moved very fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a> and almost hit the camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The landing was eventful, described with "metal clanking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a> and a sense of relief from the participants, stating, "We're on the ground, we survive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, highlighting the perceived risk of [[plane_crash_survival | plane crash survival]] associated with the flight.

Despite the apprehension and the flight's "rickety" nature, the experience was later humorously noted as "still better than the [[comparison_of_different_plane_ticket_prices_and_experiences | $1000 plane]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

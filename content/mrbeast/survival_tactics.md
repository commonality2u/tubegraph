The subject of this challenge undertook the extreme feat of being buried alive in a coffin for 50 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This experience presented significant [[survival_challenges | survival challenges]] and required various [[survival_strategies_and_making_a_routine | survival strategies]] to endure.

## Precautionary Measures & Safety Protocols

To ensure the subject's [[survival in the wilderness | survival]] during the challenge, several safety measures were implemented:
*   **Ventilation System** An AC unit was connected directly to the coffin to provide air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Constant Monitoring** The subject was monitored at all times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, with controls for interior lighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. All monitoring equipment was moved into a truck during rain and a tornado warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Medical Standby** A medic was kept on standby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Food and Drink** Beef jerky and vanilla wafers were provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Personal Coping [[survival_strategies_and_making_a_routine | Strategies]]

The subject employed various personal [[survival_strategies_and_making_a_routine | strategies]] to manage the physical and psychological toll of confinement:
*   **Waste Management** For urination, bottles were used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, resulting in "pee bottles" accumulating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. The subject opted to hold bowel movements for over 40 hours to avoid using the coffin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This was considered a "feat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Combating Boredom and Claustrophobia**
    *   Attempting to explore the small space by moving to the other side of the coffin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
    *   Interacting with objects, such as attempting to pick up a camera with toes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
    *   Turning off the walkie-talkie by removing batteries to avoid external noise and pranks from friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
    *   Finding humor in the situation, for instance, by calling himself "the opposite of Chandler" regarding poop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   **Managing Discomfort** Enduring physical pain like a sore back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a> and unpleasant smells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## External [[survival_challenges | Challenges]] and Distractions

Despite safety measures, external factors and pranks created additional [[survival_challenges | challenges]]:
*   **Verbal Harassment** Friends constantly shouted at him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a> and made rude remarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Simulated Threats** Friends pretended to urinate on the grave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, threatened tasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, created a "tornado" warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, and launched fireworks that caused smoke to enter the ventilation system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   **Physical Disturbance** Friends dug a large hole next to the coffin to draw on its side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, and later used sledgehammers to disturb the ground above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

The experience was described as terrifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> and stupid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>, but the subject successfully completed the 50-hour duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

## Physical Limitations

The task of eating large amounts of food is not merely about capacity but involves managing physical discomfort and natural body responses. Throughout the challenge, the participants experienced feelings of extreme fullness, with some members of the team expressing their struggle with continuing to consume the pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. One of the team members even considered vomiting due to the overwhelming sensation of being full <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

Competitive eaters face intense physical stress, including stomach expansion. Joey Chestnut's weight increased by 21 pounds during this challenge, highlighting the visible physical changes that occur during such eating endeavors [[psychological_and_physical_challenges_of_endurance_competitions | psychological and physical challenges of endurance competitions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

## Mental Endurance

The mental aspect of consuming food on this scale is equally challenging. As Mr. Beast's team discovered, keeping motivation high while battling physical discomfort is a monumental task.

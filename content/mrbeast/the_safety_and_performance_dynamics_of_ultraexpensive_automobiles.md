Ultra-expensive automobiles offer a spectrum of features from advanced self-driving capabilities and extreme speeds to unparalleled safety and unique historical significance. These vehicles often push the boundaries of automotive engineering and luxury.

## Performance and Features

### Advanced Self-Driving Technology
The $100,000 car, described as a Tesla, demonstrates advanced self-driving capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. It can move with no one currently inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, and it can switch lanes automatically without the driver touching the gas or steering wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This vehicle is noted for its spacious interior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, but its acceleration can be "terrifying," jerking passengers backward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Extreme Speed and Power
Vehicles in higher price brackets showcase formidable performance:
*   **$200,000 Lamborghini:** This car, while having less space than the Tesla, is described as having significant power and being "insane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. It can accelerate rapidly with minimal gas input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a> and is considered by the driver to be one of the fastest cars they've ever driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Its engine produces a loud, "angry" sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **$10 Million Koenigsegg Vader:** This unique car is the world's fastest production car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Its speed is attributed to a twin-turbocharged V8 engine and an air-core carbon fiber frame, which makes it nearly 500 pounds lighter than a Lamborghini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Riding in it is compared to a roller coaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

### Unique Hybrid Capabilities
Some luxury vehicles offer extraordinary transformations:
*   **$500,000 Boat Car:** This vehicle appears as a normal car on land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a> but transforms into a boat when driven into water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. It can be driven like a normal car but on water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a> and can even perform "donuts" in the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **$600,000 Flying Car:** This vehicle is both completely street legal and capable of flying, with wings that can take it up to 8,000 feet in the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. It features a propeller and takes off from the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

### Environmental Innovation
The $2 million limited edition hydrogen car is entirely powered by hydrogen and emits drinkable water as exhaust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Despite being a prototype and never driven on a road before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, it boasts a range of over 1,000 miles and a top speed of 221 miles per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

### Classic and Exotic Cars
The collection includes iconic and historically significant vehicles:
*   **$20 Million McLaren F1:** Owned by Jay Leno, this car features a V12 carbon fiber engine, is extremely light at 2,300 pounds (compared to modern cars at 4,000 pounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>, and has a top speed of 241 miles per hour, which was the fastest for a non-turbocharged, non-supercharged car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. It also has a unique three-seat configuration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   **$30 Million Ferrari:** This car was specifically constructed as a gift from the founder of Ferrari to the founder of Ford, making it the only version of this Ferrari ever made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
*   **$50 Million Jaguar:** This is the most expensive Jaguar in existence and was the daily driver of legendary actor Steve McQueen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
*   **$100 Million First Ferrari:** Considered the most historic and valuable car, this vehicle is so delicate that only a museum representative is allowed to drive it, and only on a specially prepared bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. Roads were closed, and street cleaners filled potholes to ensure its protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

## Safety and Durability

While performance is a hallmark of luxury cars, some are designed with extreme safety in mind.

### The $300,000 Safest Car
This vehicle is marketed as the "safest car on the planet," resembling a tank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Its safety features include:
*   **Bulletproof Windows:** The windows are notably thick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Explosive-Proof Armor:** The entire car is encased in armor designed to withstand explosives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Smokescreen Capability:** It can deploy a smokescreen at the push of a button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Explosive-Proof Frame:** The most significant safety feature is its "little explosive proof frame around the car" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

#### Explosion Test
To demonstrate its durability, the $300,000 car was subjected to an explosion, unlike a normal car that was destroyed and had mannequins ejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. The "safest car" survived the blast with only minor scrapes and a dent in the window, proving its explosion-proof claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

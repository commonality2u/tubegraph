The process of launching fireworks varied significantly depending on their size and complexity, ranging from simple ignition to elaborate setups involving specialized equipment and safety protocols.

## Small to Medium Fireworks

Smaller, less expensive fireworks were typically launched by directly lighting their fuse.
*   A $1 firework was lit by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   Similar methods were used for $10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, $50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, and $375 fireworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   For a $1,000 collection of nine boxes, the fireworks were also manually ignited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Large-Scale Launches

As the price and size of the fireworks increased, so did the complexity and safety measures for their launch.

### 160-Pound Mortar
A massive 160-pound mortar, capable of leaving its tube at 500 feet per second, required specific preparations:
*   [[firework_safety_and_effects | FAA clearance]] was necessary to ensure no planes were in the sky during the launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   All personnel had to move 500 feet away before ignition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   The launch sequence involved hitting the power button on a control panel, turning a key, and then pressing a designated launch button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   A countdown preceded the launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### Manny (Rocket-Strapped Dummy)
For an experiment involving a dummy named Manny with 100 rockets strapped to it, the launch was initiated with a direct countdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Fireworks in a Car
To observe the effects of fireworks inside a car:
*   The trunk of a car was filled with fireworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   Additional fireworks were placed inside the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   A single firework was lit to trigger a chain reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

### Microwaving a Firework
An unusual experiment involved microwaving a firework:
*   A firework designed to explode 1,000 feet in the air was placed in a microwave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   The microwave was set for one minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   [[explosive_resistance_tests | Bulletproof glass]] was used as a safety measure for observers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

### Group Launches
*   **520 Sparklers:** A large number of sparklers were arranged to form a logo and activated simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **150 Fireworks:** 150 fireworks were launched at the same time from a command center after a countdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   **4,000 Shells ($10,000 Show):** A show consisting of 4,000 shells, which typically lasted five minutes when launched sequentially, was launched all at once by pressing a single button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

### [[worlds_largest_firework | World's Largest Firework]]
The launch of the [[worlds_largest_firework | world's largest firework]], costing $160,000, weighing 4,000 pounds, and buried in a 15-foot-deep hole, involved a highly controlled process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>:
*   A forklift was required to position the firework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   The control panel was turned on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
*   A key was turned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   Multiple individuals simultaneously pressed the launch button following a countdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   Observers were positioned 2,000 feet away to feel the shockwave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

A large-scale prank involved filling a house with [[elephant_toothpaste_experiment | elephant toothpaste]] as a surprise for a brother who was simultaneously [[executing_a_sticky_note_prank | covering another person's house with sticky notes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The prank, dubbed "prank inception," aimed to surprise CJ while he believed he was pranking Karl by covering Karl's house in sticky notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## The Experiment

[[elephant_toothpaste_experiment | Elephant toothpaste]] is created by combining hydrogen peroxide with another substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The prank utilized an immense quantity of the foam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### Expert Involvement

To manage the scale of the experiment, an expert named Mark was brought in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Mark holds two world records related to [[achieving_an_elephant_toothpaste_world_record | elephant toothpaste]] and has experience with multiple videos on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Preparation and Scale

The amount of elephant toothpaste prepared was enough to fill five houses, though only one was needed for the prank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. A total of 14 drums of hydrogen peroxide were used for the main event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This quantity, utilizing 500 gallons of hydrogen peroxide, nearly doubled the standing world record for [[achieving_an_elephant_toothpaste_world_record | elephant toothpaste]] at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

Prior to the main event, a smaller test was conducted in a bathroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This test revealed the extreme heat generated by the reaction, causing a "wave of heat" and steaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Safety protocols, such as getting far away, were emphasized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## The Prank Execution

The team ensured all important items were removed from the house before the experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. CJ's roommate gave permission for the prank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. The plan was to unleash the foam as soon as CJ pulled into his driveway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The foam erupted from the house, coming out of the chimney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### [[participant_reactions_to_unusual_tasks | Participant Reactions]]

The scale of the foam was described as "insane" and "chaotic," with expectations that windows would be blown out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. CJ was shocked upon seeing his house engulfed in foam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Windows were indeed broken, with permission given to break the front window to enter the foam-filled house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The foam was observed to be hot and steamy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Resolution

As a result of the extensive damage caused by the [[pranking_brothers_with_elephant_toothpaste | elephant toothpaste prank]], CJ was gifted a brand new house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Additionally, a team was assigned to work around the clock to fix his old house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

In a large-scale event, 40 cars were given away to a YouTube channel's 40 millionth subscriber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This extensive collection included a Porsche, a Chrysler, a Tesla with a custom 40 million subscriber wrap, and even a unique SpongeBob-themed car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The total cost of acquiring these vehicles exceeded $500,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Identifying the Recipient
The 40 millionth subscriber, identified as Luke, was found by refreshing YouTube's list of most recent subscribers upon hitting the milestone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Luke was initially only informed that he would receive a surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## [[car_giveaway_logistics | Logistics and Grand Reveal]]
To transport the 40 cars to Luke, who lived a 10-hour drive away, they were loaded onto car haulers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Upon arrival, Luke was blindfolded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a> and led outside where the cars were being unloaded onto his lawn for the reveal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Luke was surprised, admitting he didn't really believe they would show up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## The Challenge
After the initial shock of receiving 40 cars, Luke was presented with a challenge: if he could give away all 40 cars in under 24 hours, he would win the custom-wrapped Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Initial Giveaways
Luke began by giving cars to his immediate family and friends.
*   His brother, Jake, received the first car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   His younger brother, Ben (10 years old), also received a car, with Luke driving it off the lot for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   His parents selected a Grand Cherokee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   A Porsche was given to another friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   Luke also texted all his friends to come and pick up a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, including his friend Carson who chose a Subaru <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   Luke gave cars to his grandparents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a> and great-aunt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, who expressed gratitude for the unexpected gifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### Unique Cars and [[surprise_giveaways_and_prizes | Hidden Surprises]]
Among the cars were several unique vehicles:
*   The SpongeBob car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, which had a water gun feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   A Jurassic Park Jeep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   A modified vehicle made of three trucks glued together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
*   Some cars had hidden prizes:
    *   A car that broke down had money in the trunk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
    *   Another non-working car also contained a bunch of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
    *   The three-truck vehicle contained multiple PlayStations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

### [[surprising_people_with_free_cars_and_merchandise | Random Acts of Giving]]
As the challenge progressed, Luke and the team expanded their efforts to include [[giving_away_items_in_unique_and_entertaining_ways | random people]] and community members:
*   They approached people at Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, offering free cars, which many found hard to believe initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   At Zaxby's, they played a game of chance, giving away a car to a college-bound student who picked the winning number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. This recipient expressed deep gratitude, stating that people in their area often struggle and work hard for what they have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   Luke also gave a car to Steve, who works for his dad, expressing that he deserved a good car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   Mark, a previous winner of a million dollars from the channel, also stopped by to help give away cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

### The Final Car and Reward

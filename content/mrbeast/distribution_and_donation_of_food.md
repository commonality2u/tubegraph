### Middle School Donation

One of the key highlights of the food distribution was the food delivery to a local middle school. Mr. Beast's team loaded their car with the stockpiled food and delivered it to the school, thus supporting [[community_philanthropy_and_donations | local students’ meals]].

### Providing for Law Enforcement

In addition to the middle school, the police department was another beneficiary of their food donations. Mr. Beast’s team ordered assortments from the menu, asking the officers for their preferences, and [[utilizing_store_products_strategically | provided these orders to the local precinct]].

### Additional Measures to Prevent Waste

To further combat food waste, the team adjusted their ordering strategy by opting for bottled water and orange juice towards the latter part of the day. This ensured that any unconsumed items could be easily stored and distributed later on, maintaining their freshness.

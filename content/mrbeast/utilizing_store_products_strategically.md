## Utilizing Store Products Strategically: A Survival Challenge

In a unique challenge orchestrated by Jimmy, Alex was given the opportunity to live in a grocery store, with the potential to earn $10,000 every day he stayed there. The twist? For each $10,000 increment Alex received, he had to sell Jimmy $10,000 worth of products from the store. This added a layer of strategy to the challenge, as Alex had to intelligently decide what items to sell each day to sustain his stay as long as possible.

### The Initial Strategy

From the onset, Alex showcased his strategic thinking by targeting expensive electronics, such as TVs, which he did not need for survival in the store. This decision maximized his ability to stay in the game without compromising on essential food items he needed for sustenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Daily Adjustments and Rationalizing Choices

Alex faced the ongoing challenge of discerning which items would lose value quicker and thus should be prioritized for sale. For instance, on day five, Alex sold $10,000 worth of quickly perishable produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. He followed with baby diapers and continued adapting his choices based on the longevity and necessity of the items in the store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

He constructed a makeshift shower from store shelves and plastic liners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a> and built water bottle walls to form a cozy shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, demonstrating his proficiency in [[adapting_living_conditions_for_a_prolonged_stay | adapting living conditions for a prolonged stay]] under unique circumstances.

### Shifting Strategies with Available Resources

The temporary loss of electricity forced Alex to rapidly pivot his sales strategy towards frozen products that required refrigeration, ensuring he didn't lose valuable items due to spoilage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

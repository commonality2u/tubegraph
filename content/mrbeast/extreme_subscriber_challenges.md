Reaching 100 million subscribers is an extraordinary achievement for any YouTube creator. To commemorate this milestone, MrBeast orchestrated a series of intense and thrilling challenges with a private island as the grand prize. This article delves into the challenges subscribers faced and how these feats were designed, creating an unforgettable celebration for both participants and viewers.

## The Private Island Competition

The event was set on a grand scale right from the start. MrBeast, known for his philanthropic and extravagant gifts, purchased a massive private island to serve as the prize. In an announcement that captured the attention of millions, he invited 100 subscribers to compete in a series of challenges to win the island themselves [[island_competition_format | Island competition format]] [00:00:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>).

## The Challenges

### Challenge One: Fire Starting

The first test for the contestants was primal yet practical – start a fire using limited resources. Only the first 50 who succeeded in lighting a torch could advance to the next round [[survival_strategies_on_a_deserted_island | Survival strategies on a deserted island]] [00:00:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>). It was a battle of survival skills and determination, setting the tone for the intensity and competitiveness that followed.

### Challenge Two: Red Light, Green Light

Drawing inspiration from his most viewed video, the Squid Game recreation, the second challenge was a reboot of "Red Light, Green Light". Conducted in the middle of the ocean, the objective was simple but nerve-racking: only the first 20 to cross a designated red line would move on [[red_light_green_light | Red Light Green Light]] [00:01:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>). This challenge showcased precision and stealth, eliminating participants with the slightest misstep.

### Challenge Three: Plank Drop

In the third act of this epic contest, 10 planks loomed ominously from a pirate ship. Contestants had to choose wisely, for five planks were engineered to drop them into the ocean while only five were safe [[decision_making_and_honesty_in_high_stakes_situations | Decision making and honesty in high stakes situations]] [00:06:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>). This game of chance left only the luckiest to proceed to the final challenge.

### Final Challenge: The Treasure Hunt

The ultimate task was a scavenger hunt across the island to find the 100 million subscriber play button, which contained the deed to the island [[successful_completion_of_a_highstakes_challenge | Successful completion of a highstakes challenge]] [00:11:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>). Participants scoured every inch of the terrain in a frantic race that tested their observational skills and perseverance.

## The Winner

After a day of surviving intense challenges and strategic guessing, one contestant emerged victorious. The winner not only gained possession of the private island but also became a part of YouTube history by participating in one of the most unique celebrations of subscriber milestones [[impact_of_challenges_on_participant_decision_making | Impact of challenges on participant decision making]] [00:14:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>).

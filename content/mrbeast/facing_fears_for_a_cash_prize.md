A unique competition featured contestant Mack, who was challenged to face a series of his deepest fears with the ultimate goal of winning a substantial cash prize. The competition aimed to test Mack's courage, particularly after he had previously lost a significant sum of money in a similar challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. Initially, the grand prize was $800,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>, but this amount was subject to change based on his performance in certain [[Risk versus reward challenges | risk-versus-reward challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

## Contestant Background
Mack had previously competed in a challenge video where he lost $800,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. This new competition offered him a chance to win that money back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>, creating a strong [[Contestants motivations for winning | motivation]] for him to succeed. He initially claimed not to be afraid of anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Challenges Faced

Mack was put through a series of six fears, testing his physical and mental limits. The [[Use of fear as motivation in competitions | use of fear as motivation]] was central to the competition's design.

### Fear of Spiders
For the first challenge, Mack was sealed in a container with 1,000 spiders and had to survive for 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Despite his initial bravado, he admitted to feeling "a little bit" scared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. He successfully completed this challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

### Fear of Heights (Freefall)
The second challenge involved the fear of heights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. Mack was required to stand on the end of a plank 200 feet high, unclip his safety harness, and press a button to freefall, trusting that he would be caught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. He was visibly shaking and expressed intense fear, noting he couldn't even see the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. Despite the option to "tap out" and admit fear for no prize money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>, he completed the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

### Sinking Car Challenge
This [[Survival challenge for money | survival challenge for money]] involved Mack being dropped into a lake inside a car, which quickly began to sink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. The prize money, initially $800,000, was divided into eight duffel bags in the back seat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. The amount he could save from the sinking car would determine how much money he would continue competing for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. He was given an offer of $100,000 to quit and admit fear, which he refused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

The car sank quickly, making retrieval difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. Mack, a borderline Olympic swimmer, was praised for his athletic performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>. Unbeknownst to him, the last two bags were seatbelted, increasing the difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. Ultimately, he only managed to retrieve $700,000, as the car sank 45 feet deep, making the last $100,000 impossible to retrieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>. This meant his prize money was reduced to $700,000 for the remainder of the competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. Seven safety divers were on standby during this challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.

### Mystery Box
Mack was required to reach into a metal box and pull out an object, first signing a waiver stating he couldn't sue if anything hurt him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. This was revealed to be a prank, and the objects were actually brand new Feastables chocolate bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.

### Buried Alive for 24 Hours
This [[Challenge to survive in a circle for cash prize | challenge to survive in a circle for cash prize]] involved Mack being buried alive in a coffin for 24 hours without knowing the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. If he emerged before the 24-hour mark, he would lose everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. He wore a wristband to monitor his heart rate and vitals, but it did not provide the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>.

Mack's strategy was to stay awake for 2 hours, then sleep for 10 hours, and repeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>. However, his sense of time quickly became inaccurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>, and he struggled to stay asleep for long periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>. He began to experience claustrophobia and physical discomfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>. Despite his growing anxiety and urges to quit, he held out. Upon being dug up, it was revealed he had been buried for 36 hours, well over the 24-hour requirement, meaning he successfully passed this challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:00">[16:02:00]</a>.

### Fear of Failure (Cookie Cutter Challenge)
The final [[Challenge to win money | challenge to win money]] was a 1-to-1 recreation of the challenge Mack failed previously, which was explicitly named the "fear of failure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:39:00">[16:39:00]</a>. He had lost $800,000 on this exact set before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>.

The rules were simple: cut out shapes from four stages of cookies without breaking any <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:23:00">[17:23:00]</a>. If he broke a cookie, he would lose the remaining $700,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29:00">[17:29:00]</a>. He was offered $300,000 to quit before starting, which he refused, opting to risk it all for the full $700,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:41:00">[17:41:00]</a>. He was given 34 minutes and 54 seconds, the exact time it took him to complete the challenge last time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:23:00">[18:23:00]</a>. Mack adopted a strategy of going fast on easier shapes to save time for the notoriously difficult "umbrella" shape, which had caused his previous failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>. He successfully completed the final challenge, winning the $700,000 prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:46:00">[21:46:00]</a>.

## Outcome
Mack ultimately triumphed over his fears, earning $700,000. The experience highlighted that his greatest challenge was not external fears, but the [[Use of fear as motivation in competitions | fear of his own failure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:46:00">[21:46:00]</a>. The [[Large cash prizes in competitive events | large cash prizes]] served as a powerful motivator throughout the intense competition.

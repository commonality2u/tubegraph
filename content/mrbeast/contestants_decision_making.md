One hundred subscribers were brought to a private island to compete in four extreme challenges for the chance to win the island itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Throughout the competition, contestants faced various scenarios requiring [[decision_making_and_strategy_among_contestants | strategic decision-making]] and rapid adaptation.

## Challenge 1: Start a Fire

The first challenge required contestants to be among the first 50 people to start a fire and light their torch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This challenge tested basic survival skills and speed.

*   **Decision**: Focus on efficiency to ignite a fire quickly.
*   **Outcome**: Contestants who failed to light their torches within the top 50 were eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. While MrBeast initially estimated it would take 20 minutes on average, the first contestant lit their torch in about one minute, demonstrating quick [[contestant_competition_strategies | action]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Challenge 2: Red Light, Green Light

The second challenge was a recreation of "Red Light, Green Light" from *Squid Game*, set in the middle of the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Only the first 20 contestants to step on or cross a red line would move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

*   **Decision**: Move during "green light" and freeze completely during "red light."
*   **Outcome**:
    *   One contestant was eliminated for moving during "red light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
    *   Contestant Tariq demonstrated clever [[game_show_style_decision_making | decision-making]] by correctly identifying a technicality in MrBeast's phrasing ("Red light, green light is there's no time limit"), which allowed him to move during what seemed like a "red light" period, becoming the first finisher by technicality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. MrBeast confirmed his interpretation, noting, "Every word that leaves this mouth I gotta think it through" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
    *   Ultimately, 30 contestants were eliminated in this round, leaving 20 to advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## Mid-Game Elimination by Earliest Subscriber

The 20 remaining contestants were told that only 10 seats were available on a raft to the next challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. The earliest subscriber, Gabbie, was given the power to eliminate half the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

*   **Decision (Gabbie)**: Individually select 10 contestants for elimination. This was a difficult personal [[decision_making_and_strategy_among_contestants | decision]], with Gabbie expressing regret while doing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: 10 contestants were eliminated by Gabbie's choice, leaving the final 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

## Challenge 3: The Plank Walk

The final 10 contestants arrived at a pirate ship for the next challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Ten planks were available, but only five would support a contestant, while the other five would drop them into the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

*   **Decision**: Each contestant chose a plank, hoping it was one of the five safe ones. This involved an element of pure chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Outcome**:
    *   The first four contestants remarkably chose safe planks, defying statistical probability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
    *   After four safe choices, the remaining contestants were lined up, and planks were cut sequentially until only five remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
    *   The challenge ultimately came down to the final two contestants, with one plank dropping and one being safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Five contestants were eliminated, leaving five finalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

## Pre-Final Challenge: The $50,000 Offer

Before the final challenge, each of the five finalists was offered a check for $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. They had to decide whether to keep the money and leave the competition or burn the check to continue competing for the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This was a significant test of [[contestants_motivations_for_winning | motivation]] and [[prize_incentives_and_participant_decisions | risk tolerance]].

*   **Decision**: Accept $50,000 or gamble for the island.
*   **Outcome**:
    *   All five finalists chose to burn the $50,000 check, demonstrating strong resolve to win the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. One contestant noted that $50,000 "couldn't even pay for a year's worth of tuition," indicating a strong incentive to aim for the higher prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

## Final Challenge: Find the Play Button

For the final challenge, the 100 million subscriber play button, with the deed to the island taped to its back, was hidden on the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. The first contestant to find it would win.

*   **Decision**: Search the island for the hidden play button. This involved [[strategies_and_tactics_used_by_contestants | search strategies]] and anticipating MrBeast's hiding spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: MrBeast strategically hid the button close to the starting point, despite driving the golf cart far away to mislead the blindfolded contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. After an extensive search, one contestant, Nolan, walked past the hidden button multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>, before another contestant found it, winning the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

This series of challenges highlighted the diverse forms of [[contestant_strategies_and_dynamics | decision-making]] involved, from quick physical reactions to psychological gambles and strategic searching.

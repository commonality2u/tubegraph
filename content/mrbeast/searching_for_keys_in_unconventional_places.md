In various challenges, participants are tasked with finding keys hidden in unexpected and often overwhelming environments. These scenarios test their problem-solving skills, patience, and ability to navigate unusual terrains.

## Red Solo Cup City Challenge

One such challenge involves a "city of red solo cups," stated to contain over 1 billion cups, where a key is hidden within the vast collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. Participants must manually search through the cups to locate the key required to open a safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. Chandler successfully found the key in this environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

## Lego Mountain Key Retrieve

Another unique key-finding challenge features a "mountain of Legos" with a key dangling above it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. The objective is to use the Legos to build a structure tall enough to reach and grab the key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. This task requires strategic building and coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. Chandler also managed to secure this key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

## Beach Sand Key Search

A challenge also includes a key hidden within a "giant beach" (a large sandpit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. For this task, participants are provided with [[using_tools_like_metal_detectors_in_challenges | metal detectors]] to aid in the search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. Despite the use of technology, the search can still be difficult, and in one instance, a participant mistook a rock for the key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>. The key was eventually found, though it broke in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.

These challenges highlight the variety of ways items can be concealed and the diverse [[strategies_for_finding_valuable_items_in_dumpsters | strategies for finding valuable items]] in unexpected places.

The creators have announced plans for an upcoming video involving the destruction of a house and its replacement with a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54"></a>.

## Project Details
The "next video" will feature the team destroying the house shown in the current video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55"></a>. The plan is to fill the entire house with slime and completely destroy it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58"></a>. Following its destruction, they intend to buy the residents a [[surprising_with_a_new_house | new house]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01"></a>.

## Deception and Viewer Call to Action
The current occupants of the house are unaware of these plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02"></a>. They believe the team is simply present to pick up the Orbeez used in the current video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04"></a>, rather than to destroy their home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06"></a>. Viewers are encouraged to watch for a video titled "Destroying my friend's house and buying him a new one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09"></a>.

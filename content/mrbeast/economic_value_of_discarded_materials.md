videoId: anFxsa5jXrE
---

From: [[mrbeast]] <br/> 

The concept of finding economic value in discarded items was explored through a [[dumpster_diving_competitions | dumpster diving competition]] where participants searched 100 dumpsters for valuable goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The goal was to identify items that could be appraised for money, highlighting the potential worth of materials often considered trash.

## The Competition

The competition pitted Chris against Weddle, with each participant taking turns to find the most valuable items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. A professional appraiser was present to determine the monetary worth of each item found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The contestant who accumulated the most money from their finds would win $10,000, later increased to $12,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## [[Appraising found items | Appraising Found Items]]

The appraisal process was central to determining the [[economic_value_of_discarded_materials | economic value of discarded materials]]. Various items were brought to the appraiser, whose valuations fluctuated based on condition, utility, and sometimes perceived novelty.

## Challenges and Humor in [[strategies_for_finding_valuable_items_in_dumpsters | Dumpster Diving Strategies]]

Participants faced challenges like smelly items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, empty dumpsters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, or those deemed "extremely gross" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Chris even refused to go into one dumpster after seeing a rat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. The role of the appraiser also saw comedic moments, such as Chandler 2.0 appraising items over FaceTime while preparing for surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, and Jimmy (the host) stepping in as appraiser when the professional was unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

## Final Scores and Outcome

After inspecting approximately 100 dumpsters, the final totals were revealed:
*   Weddle: $1,421.59 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>
*   Chris: $1,531.69 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>

Chris won the competition by $57.79 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>, taking home the $12,000 prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. Despite losing, Weddle was treated to a shopping spree at the mall by Chris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

### Conclusion

The competition demonstrated that discarded materials, often overlooked as waste, can hold significant [[economic_value_of_discarded_materials | economic value]]. From common household items to unexpected finds like swords and vintage electronics, the cumulative worth of these materials can be substantial, highlighting the potential for reclamation and reuse.

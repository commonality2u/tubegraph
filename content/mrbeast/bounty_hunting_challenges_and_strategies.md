This article details the strategies employed by both the hunted and the bounty hunters in a high-stakes challenge where the goal is to evade capture and protect a $100,000 prize until midnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The challenge involves a professional bounty hunter attempting to retrieve a backpack containing $100,000 from Jimmy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Challenge Setup and Incentives
The challenge is set with [[mr_beast_challenge_setup_and_rules | clear rules]]: the bounty hunter has until midnight to steal the backpack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The [[incentives_and_motivations_in_challenges | motivation]] for the bounty hunter is the $100,000 prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, which he states will serve as a college fund for his young child and change his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

## Strategies for Evading Capture (The Hunted)

Jimmy's [[high_stakes_challenge_strategies | strategies]] focus on misdirection, rapid movement, and exploiting prepared locations:

### Vehicle Changes and Pre-positioning
*   **Initial Escape:** Jimmy and his companion Tariq start in a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   **Car Switching:** Recognizing the bounty hunters know his car, Jimmy immediately drives to a dealership to buy a new car, a Kia Soul, which he purchases for $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. He later ditches the Kia Soul as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Hidden Vehicles:**
    *   A U-Haul truck is planted for escape from the warehouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
    *   An ATV is used in a large field, providing a rapid escape over terrain inaccessible to cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The ATV is later ditched due to train tracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
    *   Another car (a Mustang) is hidden behind a bush in a field with porta-potties, serving as a getaway vehicle after a major diversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
    *   A boat is pre-arranged at a mansion dock for a water escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
    *   Yet another car is purchased at a dock after the boat escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

### Diversions and Misdirection
*   **Vault as a Decoy:** Jimmy has a bank-grade vault installed in a warehouse and seals himself inside, leading the bounty hunters to believe he is trapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This functions as a [[decoy_vault_and_challenges | decoy vault]].
*   **Secret Exits:** Unknown to the hunters, the vault has a secret tunnel allowing escape from the warehouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Pre-recorded Messages:** Jimmy leaves a computer playing a pre-recorded message in the warehouse, taunting the hunters once he has escaped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Movie Theater Hideout:** Jimmy rents an entire movie theater, using a secret door to evade detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. He then hides *under* the movie theater, knowing the hunters would search on the roof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Fire Alarm as a Distraction:** Jimmy arranges for the fire department to disconnect a fire alarm earlier in the day, then triggers it as a distraction for his escape from the movie theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Porta-Potty Helicopter Diversion:** In a large field, Jimmy sets up multiple porta-potties and a helicopter. He gives the bounty hunter a false phone call, making it seem he's trapped in a porta-potty that is then lifted by the helicopter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This elaborate setup is a diversion while he escapes in a hidden car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### Pre-planning and Resource Utilization
*   **Extensive Preparations:** Jimmy states he has a helicopter, a dozen cars, and "everything" lined up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Rented Locations:** He rents a warehouse for the vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, an entire movie theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, and a mansion for a temporary safe house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. He also planned to rent every room in a hotel as a final hiding spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   **Security Camera Monitoring:** At the mansion, Jimmy has security cameras hooked up everywhere to monitor the hunters' arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. He also uses security cameras on his phone to track the hunters' movements in the movie theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   **Human Resources:** He employs Tariq as a companion and a sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   **Financial Leverage:** Jimmy uses large sums of money to buy vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, a hat for $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, and to rent locations, demonstrating his [[high_stakes_challenge_strategies | willingness to spend]] to win.

### [[winning_strategies_in_contests | Last Resort - Teammate Sacrifice]]
*   **Sacrifice Tariq:** As they approach the final location (an abandoned hospital), Jimmy tells Tariq he needs to "sacrifice" him by having him tackle the bounty hunter upon arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Tariq performs the tackle, allowing Jimmy to briefly escape before Chris intervenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

## Strategies for Hunting (The Bounty Hunters)

The bounty hunter and his team (Chris and Karl) employ persistent tracking and observation, demonstrating [[competition_dynamics_in_scavenger_challenges | determination]] in their pursuit:

### Tracking and Surveillance
*   **Phone Tracker:** The bounty hunter quickly places a tracker on Jimmy's phone, allowing them to know his exact location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This is their primary tool for [[hide_and_seek_strategies | hide and seek]].
*   **GPS Monitoring:** They constantly monitor Jimmy's GPS location on their phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The GPS is crucial for maintaining pursuit even when Jimmy changes vehicles or locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Observation and Deduction:**
    *   They deduce Jimmy is switching cars when they see he stopped at a dealership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
    *   They question the car salesman to confirm Jimmy's new vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
    *   They realize Jimmy escaped the vault via a secret back exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
    *   They notice a suspicious camera at the movie theater and follow its cord to deduce Jimmy is watching them and might be below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
    *   They identify Jimmy's hidden Mustang in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
    *   At the mansion, they use GPS to narrow down three potential houses and then visually spot Jimmy's Mustang and boat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Relentless Pursuit
*   **Vehicular Chase:** The hunters use cars and a truck to keep pace with Jimmy's changing vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. They even attempt to parallel Jimmy's boat with their truck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   **Physical Endurance:** They frequently leave their vehicles to run across fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a> and through buildings, demonstrating high physical effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. The bounty hunter admits to being exhausted but motivated by the reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Aggressive Tactics:** They are willing to break locks on a U-Haul if they suspect Jimmy is inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. They also attempt to jump off a bridge onto Jimmy's boat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a> and even bumper-check Jimmy's car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
*   **Teamwork:** The bounty hunter communicates constantly with Chris and Karl, strategizing their next moves and sharing information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Outcome

Ultimately, the bounty hunter successfully captures Jimmy at an abandoned hospital after Tariq's attempted tackle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. Despite Jimmy's elaborate [[challenges_and_hiding_strategies | hiding strategies]] and the bounty hunter's relentless pursuit, Chris's bear hug on Jimmy allowed the bounty hunter to catch up and grab the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. The bounty hunter wins the $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

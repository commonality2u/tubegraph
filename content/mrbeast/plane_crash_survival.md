Upon purchasing a private jet, the individuals involved immediately experienced a crash, becoming stranded in an unknown location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Rescue teams typically take an average of 31 hours to locate plane crash survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The objective was to survive until rescue arrived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Initial Assessment and Resource Management

Upon impact, the survivors assessed the damage and available resources from the private jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Initial findings included water bottles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> and snacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. A key strategy for [[resource_management_in_survival_situations | resource management]] was to pool all plane resources on the wing and to [[resource_management_in_survival_situations | ration]] the limited food and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Private jets are noted to carry very little food and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Survival Strategies and Challenges

### Shelter and Organization
A division of labor was proposed: half the group would explore the area, while the other half would organize inventory and build a shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The group used plane pieces to construct a temporary tent-like shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This shelter, built under a plane wing, was recognized as potentially unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### Exploration and Navigation
Initial exploration of the area was undertaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, though its immediate objective was questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Explorers noted the environment felt like "Jurassic Park" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a> and later got lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Fire and Heat
A fire pit was successfully constructed using a ripped-off plane engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, and firewood was gathered to start a fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The fire provided warmth, especially as temperatures dropped at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, with some survivors sleeping by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

### Water and Dehydration
Dehydration became a significant challenge due to limited water supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Some individuals failed to [[resource_management_in_survival_situations | ration]] their water supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. A drone with a camera was used to scout the area and successfully located a river source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. However, upon reaching the river, the water was deemed too unclean to drink or bathe in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Dehydration led to headaches and visual disturbances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, with survivors reporting going "crazy" from lack of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Water ran out completely about 10 hours before rescue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

### Signaling for Rescue
*   **Flare Gun:** A flare gun was available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, but its use was debated due to the possibility of needing it later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Drone Thermal Camera:** A drone with a thermal camera was used to test if a message written in urine could be detected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. The message, initials, was visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Helipad Preparation:** Towards the end of the 31-hour period, survivors began constructing a helipad for rescue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. They used fire to clear a large "H" shape in the grass as a clear landing signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

### Other Challenges
*   **Pest Control:** The area was affected by bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, and a surprising encounter with wasps in an old Mountain Dew bottle occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, leading to the use of bug spray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Lack of Sleep:** Survivors experienced significant sleep deprivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Temperature Fluctuations:** The environment shifted from heat exhaustion during the day to freezing cold at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Comparison to Other Survival Scenarios

Participants compared this experience to other [[survival_challenges | survival challenges]]:
*   **24 hours in a desert:** The plane crash was harder because, despite the desert heat, water was available in that challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **50 hours in the wilderness:** This plane crash scenario was considered "way harder" than [[survival_in_the_wilderness | 50 hours in the wilderness]] because water was available in the wilderness challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

## Rescue

After exactly 31 hours, a helicopter arrived for rescue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, landing on the prepared helipad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. The survivors expressed relief and eagerness to return home for water and showers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

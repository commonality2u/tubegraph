A [[highstakes_physical_challenges | highstakes physical challenge]] involving a game of tag was set in a massive stadium, with the ultimate prize being half a million dollars in cash for the last contestant to be tagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The stadium was vast, capable of holding over 160,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The finalists for this challenge were selected from a previous video, having previously sat in a circle for 12 days straight to earn their spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Initial Phase of the Challenge

The game began with a 10-second countdown before the "seeker" (Jimmy) started looking for the contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Contestants immediately spread out, attempting to hide in the stadium's three floors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Some contestants formed alliances to avoid capture, using triangular formations to cover exits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Hiding spots included electrical boxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a> and V-suites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Difficulty and Expansion of Search Team
Due to the immense size of the stadium, the initial search efforts for hours yielded no tags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. To increase the intensity and progress the game, two additional seekers, Chris and Chandler, were brought in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

The first contestant, Jordan, was tagged and received $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Another contestant, Chris, was quickly tagged off-camera by Chandler, also receiving $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

As the challenge continued into the next day, the original seekers were replaced by SapNap and Carl to continue the search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Escalation and Rule Changes

After over 20 hours and only three contestants found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, a major rule change was introduced to transform the [[highstakes_game_show_formats | highstakes game show format]] from hide-and-seek to pure tag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. A GPS tracker was activated on contestants' phones to reveal their locations, despite a ten-second delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This immediately led to Jessica being tagged and receiving $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

### Shrinking the Play Area
To drastically shrink the area and intensify the [[competitive_environment_and_pressure_in_challenges | competitive environment]], the stadium was reduced to just the racetrack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Contestants were given 10 minutes to reach the racetrack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. This change marked a shift to an all-out chase with "no hiding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Contestants adopted [[high_stakes_challenge_strategies | strategies]] like staying mobile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

Notably, two contestants, Airrack and another, flipped a golf cart to prevent seekers from using it, prioritizing "funny content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## The Finalists and Winner

As the game progressed, two more contestants were tagged simultaneously, leaving only five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. One contestant attempted to steal a Lamborghini, leading to a strategic blockade by the seekers who then took the keys to tag him, further highlighting the [[risk_versus_reward_challenges | risk versus reward challenges]] of the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

Down to three people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>, one contestant was tagged using a decoy strategy and received a $20,000 consolation prize for third place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

The final two contestants, Lincoln and Andy, had endured 12 days in a circle and 24 hours of being chased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Lincoln ultimately won the challenge by being the last person untagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. He received the grand prize of half a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, an additional $10,000 in cash, and a brand new car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. The half-million dollars was presented in one-dollar bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

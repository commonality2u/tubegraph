A group of individuals undertook a [[survival_challenges | survival challenge]] to spend seven days in an abandoned city that was bombed and left desolate due to war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The only known inhabitants were the participants and their cameraman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Their primary goal was to explore the city and establish a safe base for the duration of the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Day 1: Arrival and Initial Setup

Upon being dropped off, the participants immediately began exploring a building to find a suitable shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The experience felt like being in a "zombie apocalypse" due to the city's wild and eerie state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

They discovered an area on a higher floor that offered a view of the city and a roof for rain protection, deciding it would serve as their first home base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Establishing Camp
After selecting their base, the next step was to retrieve supplies from a crate left by the helicopter on the roof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The crate contained all the necessary [[building_shelters_and_finding_resources | survival gear]] for the week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. They formed an "assembly line" by dropping supplies down to their camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

Tasks were assigned: Kris and Mark handled fire duty, while others searched for sleeping arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Chandler found a mattress, which he wrapped in a tarp to protect from bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, while the rest slept on wooden doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Day 2: Unsettling Discoveries and Relocation

During the night, Mark and the camera crew were awakened by the sound of breaking glass nearby, leading to speculation about whether they were truly alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Additionally, their first shelter proved too windy for comfortable sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

After a breakfast of canned chili <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, they used a drone to scout for a new, more suitable shelter in unexplored parts of the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. During this scan, they encountered an unexpected cat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

They explored more of the city, discovering a pool that had decayed over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a> and a soccer field with an ancient soccer ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. With limited daylight, they prioritized finding a new, fortified shelter to avoid freezing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

They found a room they believed would be "comfy" and protect them from the cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Moving their belongings to the new base proved challenging due to the distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. By sundown, they managed to bring most of their supplies, including one water bag, chili cans, and mattresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## Day 3: The Mystery Person

Continuing their exploration, the group ventured to a beach within the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Soon after, they spotted a reflection and suspected someone else was in the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This confirmed their earlier suspicion that they were not alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

They decided to investigate, exploring an old hotel that was once a first-class vacation resort but had become ruins due to war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. The exploration felt "eerie" as they navigated deep, dark hallways, fearing a potential attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

As darkness fell, they used a powerful flashlight to scan the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. The return to camp in the dark was "way scarier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>, reinforcing the feeling of just "surviving" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. They returned to camp, lit a fire, and had their remaining chili for dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Day 4: Dwindling Supplies and Departures

On the fourth day, supplies began to run low, particularly water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Mark and Chandler went back to "ground Zero" to retrieve more supplies from the original crate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

Meanwhile, Kris found a bike in a nearby building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Mark and Chandler attempted to lower a heavy water bag from the roof using a rope, but the rope broke, causing half their water supply to splatter on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

Due to the significant loss of water, a difficult decision was made to send two people home to ensure the remaining two could complete the [[survival_challenges | seven-day challenge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Kris and Chandler volunteered to leave the city, leaving Mark and Jimmy to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Before their departure, the group shared a final meal of Feastables s'mores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a> and signaled a boat with a flare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

## Day 5: Renovating the Shelter

With Kris and Chandler gone, Jimmy and Mark focused on improving their living conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Their objective for the day was to renovate their shelter by windproofing the room with tarps, building a fireplace, and finding furniture to make it feel like a "home" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

They explored nearby buildings, finding items like a shelf, a table, a massive carpet, and even a "fake TV" made from an iPad frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. They also found materials for a fireplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

They spent four hours clearing rubble from their shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. To combat the unpalatable water, they used Cirkul water bottles with flavor cartridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

### The New Home
The renovations transformed their shelter:
*   A new shelf for food storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
*   A table for their Cirkul bottles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
*   A makeshift door and a large tarp were installed to block wind and retain heat from the fireplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
*   A fireplace was successfully built and rigged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
*   The "fake TV" with Mark's iPad was set up, along with lighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.

### The Prank Revealed
Just as their night was going well, they heard breaking glass again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. Mark eventually revealed that he was the one causing the noises, using a remote-controlled contraption to drop bottles and prank everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

## Day 6: Last Day of Fun

On the morning of day six, the shelter's modifications proved effective, making the room at least ten degrees warmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. With only one day left, Jimmy and Mark decided to have some fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

They found a kayak and used it in the abandoned pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. They also played baseball, soccer, and Mark taught Jimmy how to skip rocks scientifically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. These activities helped distract them from the loneliness of the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.

## Day 7: Departure

By the final day, after cleaning up their camp, their sole objective was to leave the abandoned city and "never coming back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. They were successfully extracted from the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

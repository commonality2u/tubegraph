A group of individuals embarked on a 24-hour challenge to survive on a deserted island with zero inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. They brought essential supplies like tents and chairs, along with some less conventional items such as a Barbie Easy-Bake oven and Fortnite Monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The boats departed, leaving them stranded with no cell service until the following day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## The Buried Treasure Challenge

To add an element of [[Competition dynamics and teamwork | competition]] and excitement, a treasure chest containing money was buried on the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The orchestrator of the challenge used a deceptive tactic, gathering the participants for a game of hide-and-seek while secretly burying the treasure near the camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. A decoy hole was even dug to mislead them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Initially, the prize was stated to be $10,000, but it was later revealed to be $3,000 in $1 bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Individual Strategies for the Hunt

Upon learning about the buried money, participants adopted various strategies:
*   **Following the Leader**: Chris surmised that the organizer, being lazy, would likely bury the treasure far away, and planned to follow him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Exploiting Others' Success**: Chris also devised a [[Competitive teamwork | competitive strategy]] to follow another participant, Dustin, and push him when he found the treasure to claim it faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Negotiating Alliances**: Some players, like Tareq and Chris, attempted to form alliances for a "splitsee ditsee" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, with Chris offering Tareq various amounts of money to secure his cooperation in finding the treasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

Dustin was the first to find the buried treasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### Shifting Team Dynamics and Cooperation

After the treasure was found, the [[Team dynamics and strategies | team dynamics]] quickly shifted from individualistic hunting to cooperative survival. Dustin, who won the $3,000, initially offered a small amount ($20) for help with a tent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, but eventually, the prize was shared equally, with each participant receiving $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

The group then focused on the challenges of living on the island:

*   **Camp Setup**: Participants struggled with setting up tents, with Chris expressing frustration despite his self-proclaimed boy scout experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Battling High Tide**: As the tide rose, threatening their camp, the group collectively dug moats and built walls to protect their tents and supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. This collaborative effort was crucial for their survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Making Fire**: Chris, utilizing his boy scout knowledge, took the lead in building a fire for cooking hot dogs, emphasizing the principles of fuel, flame, and oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This task highlighted the importance of practical skills in a survival setting.
*   **Shared Meals**: Despite forgetting ketchup and mustard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>, the hot dogs cooked over the fire provided a much-needed meal, fostering a sense of shared accomplishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

## Conclusion

The 24-hour island challenge proved to be a grueling experience, characterized by sand, sunburn, and lack of comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. The initial [[Competitive teamwork | competitive element]] of the treasure hunt quickly gave way to a necessity for [[Team dynamics and strategies | teamwork]] and [[Team dynamics and humor in long challenges | camaraderie]] to overcome the harsh conditions. Ultimately, the boats arrived the next morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>, and the group departed, relieved to have survived and cleaned up their camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

A group of friends embarked on a 24-hour journey into the Bermuda Triangle, known as one of the most dangerous places on Earth where over 100 ships and planes have gone missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite the ominous setting, the trip evolved into a series of [[youtuber_competition_challenges | challenges]] and lighthearted competitions among the participants.

## Preparatory Measures

Upon entering the ocean, participants were asked to write their last wills and testaments as a humorous nod to the supposed dangers of the Bermuda Triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Wagers included leaving dogs to family, ostriches as free men, and various possessions to spouses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Facing the Elements: Seasickness

Early in the journey, many participants experienced severe seasickness, with one claiming to have thrown up 11 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This discomfort led the group to temporarily seek calmer waters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, highlighting the [[experiences_and_challenges_on_different_yacht_tiers | experiences and challenges on different yacht tiers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Water-Based Competitions

Despite being in the Bermuda Triangle, the group engaged in several water-based [[unique_sporting_challenges | challenges]]:

*   **Jumping off the Yacht**
    Participants spontaneously began jumping off the yacht into the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **Last One to Fall Off**
    A competition was held where the last person to fall off a floating platform won $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This test of balance and endurance showcased [[competition_dynamics_in_endurance_challenges | competition dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Chandler was declared the winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Cool Trick Competition**
    Contestants jumped off the yacht attempting the "coolest trick" for another $2,000 prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Despite some uninspired attempts, Chandler again claimed victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## Hide and Seek Challenge

To simulate the "missing" phenomenon of the Bermuda Triangle, a game of hide and seek was initiated, with the last person found winning $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. The seeker counted to 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, leading to creative hiding spots around the yacht, including inside cramped spaces and on top of the boat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Chandler again emerged victorious by being the last one found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

## Pranks and Fun

Later that night, the group engaged in pranks, waking up Chandler and hiding from him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. This culminated in a "surprise" birthday celebration for him in his own room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Other pranks included "ghost" scares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a> and playful "raids" between cabins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

## Conclusion

The 24-hour journey concluded with the participants surviving the Bermuda Triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. It was humorously determined that the only truly dangerous aspects of the experience were motion sickness and losing a $7,000 camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, rather than supernatural disappearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

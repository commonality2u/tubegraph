The "Train vs. Giant Pit" experiment involved purchasing a train and directing it at full speed into a massive pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This spectacle was presented as one of the "most insane experiments of all time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, promised later in the video after other large-scale destructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Setup

The experiment required a train and a very large pit. The train was set to travel at full speed down its tracks directly into the pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

To observe the impact, mannequins were placed in various locations on the train:
*   One mannequin was positioned in the train's cabin, believed to be "statistically the safest place to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   Another mannequin was placed "right on the front" of the train <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   A Feastables chocolate bar was also given a "front row seat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

The command to send the train was given by Nolan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

## Outcome

The train successfully went off the tracks and plunged into the pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. The visual result was described as "the coolest thing I've ever seen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

Ultimately, none of the mannequins survived the impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. The pit was declared the victor in this [[train_versus_obstacles | train versus obstacles]] challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

The Beast Olympics assembled one person from every country on Earth to compete in an [[extreme_games | extreme]] version of the Olympics [00:00:08]. The goal was to determine which country was the "best" across various [[unique_sporting_challenges | unique sporting challenges]] [00:00:04]. The ultimate prize for the winning country was a $250,000 gold medal [00:00:17]. All competitors also received $2,000 for their participation [00:18:36].

## Events

The competition featured a series of challenging events designed to test participants' physical and strategic abilities.

### Track Challenge (Hurdles and Closing Wall)

The first event was a track challenge requiring contestants to cross three progressively larger hurdles within 30 seconds before a giant wall closed them off [00:00:24].
*   **Outcome:** Over half the countries were eliminated in this initial game, with 97 countries moving on [00:01:36]. Indonesia secured first place, making the challenge "look easy" [00:00:58].

### Gymnastics of Death

This event was described as a "crazy set" and involved a complex gymnastics course [00:01:55].
*   **Rules:** Each round featured 10 countries, and only the first five individuals to reach the central platform advanced [00:02:04]. A unique aspect of this challenge was that contestants were allowed to choose their jump order [00:03:09].
*   **Outcome:** This round led to significant eliminations, with another 50 people being removed from the competition, reducing the remaining pool to 47 countries [00:05:45].

### Archery

In the archery event, each contestant was given a bow and arrow and needed to hit a target from a designated platform to advance [00:05:53].
*   **[[unique_competition_formats | Unique Competition Format]]:** To increase difficulty, contestants voted on a country to make the target further away. For every vote received, the target was pushed back ten feet [00:06:01].
    *   Indonesia, having performed exceptionally well in previous rounds, was perceived as the "biggest threat" and received 12 votes, resulting in the farthest shot of the day [00:06:22].
*   **Outcome:** Despite their strong performance in earlier rounds, Indonesia was eliminated [00:09:02]. After this event, only 16 countries remained [00:09:07].

### Mid-Competition Offer

Before the next event, participants were offered a briefcase containing $10,000. They could choose to take the money and withdraw from the competition or throw the money into a pit and continue competing for the grand prize [00:09:21].
*   **Outcome:** Only two countries, Fiji and Italy, opted to take the $10,000 and exit the competition [00:09:59].

### Fencing

The fencing event involved 1v1 matches, where the first person to hit their opponent with a specialized, technology-rigged suit would win [00:10:09].
*   **Selection:** Top finishers from the track event were given the advantage of choosing their opponents [00:10:06].
*   **Outcome:** Matches were intense, with participants giving their all [00:11:36]. This round further narrowed the field to the final seven countries: Slovenia, Moldova, Tajikistan, Eritrea, Libya, Iraq, and Samoa [00:14:04].

### Penalty Kicks (Soccer)

The final event was a series of penalty kicks, starting with a simple rule: kick the ball into the goal to advance [00:13:58].
*   **Progressive Difficulty:** The challenge quickly escalated in difficulty through several stages:
    *   Initially, everyone scored easily [00:15:01].
    *   The goal was then made significantly smaller [00:15:07].
    *   Moving walls were introduced to narrow the target even further [00:15:55].
    *   In the final round, the walls were removed, and the two remaining contestants took turns being the goalkeeper against the other, creating a direct head-to-head competition [00:17:14].
*   **[[competition_dynamics_in_endurance_challenges | Competition Dynamics]]:** This event highlighted the [[strategies_in_endurance_challenges | strategies in endurance challenges]] as the difficulty increased, leading to eliminations after several successful rounds [00:15:32].

### Final Showdown

The final two countries were Libya and Slovenia [00:17:03]. In the ultimate penalty kick showdown, with players acting as goalkeepers, Libya successfully scored against Slovenia's attempt to save the ball [00:17:42].
*   **Winner:** Libya won the $250,000 gold medal [00:18:16].
*   **Runner-up:** Slovenia received the silver medal [00:18:25].

A competition involving 100 individuals, ranging from ages one to 100, vies for a grand prize of $250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Unique to this challenge, the participants themselves determine who ultimately deserves the prize money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The contest begins with contestants confined to individual cubes, with elimination occurring if they leave or touch a red line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Initial Eliminations and Contest Dynamics
The first eliminations, as anticipated, were primarily the youngest and some of the oldest participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Within the first hour, six people were eliminated, with more expected to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Unlike previous "last to leave" challenges, this competition emphasizes building friendships and convincing others to like you, as the contestants hold the power to decide the winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Forced Group Eliminations and [[contestant_competition_strategies | Competition Strategies]]

### First Group Challenge: Collective Responsibility
An early challenge required the group to collectively decide for 10 people to leave their cubes within 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Failure to do so would result in a random elimination of 25 contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This immediate pressure led to contestants attempting to persuade others to leave, often targeting older or younger participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Despite pleas and even an offer of Roblox from one contestant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, the group failed to reach the target, resulting in a random elimination of 25 individuals chosen by a machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This showcased a critical failure in collective [[contestants_decision_making | decision-making]] under pressure.

### Captain's Dilemma: [[prize_incentives_and_participant_decisions | Prize Incentives]] vs. Group Loyalty
With 55 contestants remaining on Day Two, the challenge shifted to a unanimous vote for a winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. When this failed, rows chose captains to represent them in a "cutthroat" challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Captains were offered increasing amounts of money to step out, which would eliminate their entire row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
Initially, captains resisted offers, some stating loyalty to their row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. However, when the offer reached $100,000, contestant 30 stepped out, eliminating their entire row of 20s and 30s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. This decision, driven by personal gain over group loyalty, exemplified a brutal aspect of [[contestant_strategies_and_dynamics | contestant strategies and dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### The Spinning Wheel of Fate: [[strategies_and_tactics_used_by_contestants | Alliances and Control]]
As the game progressed, a "40s alliance" formed, committed to staying together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. A new challenge involved a spinning wheel that selected a contestant's age, and the current holder of the wheel decided if that person was eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   Contestant 67, when given the choice for 55, eliminated them, citing 55's own willingness to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   When 47 was chosen, 67 decided to keep her, which transferred control of the wheel to 47 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
*   47 then chose to keep 43, strengthening the 40s alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   43, influenced by the 40s alliance's strategy to maintain control, ruthlessly eliminated others not in their group, including 66, 57, and 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This demonstrated a clear [[winning_strategies_in_contests | winning strategy]] of self-preservation through strategic elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   A particularly difficult elimination was 11-year-old Gio, who despite a heartfelt plea, was eliminated by 43 to maintain control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
*   The 40s alliance continued to dominate eliminations until the wheel landed on 41, who then passed control to 42 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

## Self-Elimination for Prize: A Risky Bet
The remaining 20 contestants faced a challenge: if only one person voluntarily stepped out, they would win $250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. However, if more than one tried, everyone who stepped out would be eliminated with nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. Contestant 42 loudly declared his intention to step out, attempting to deter others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. Ultimately, 42 was the only one to step out, until another contestant did so with two seconds left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>, resulting in both being eliminated with nothing. This demonstrated a high-stakes [[game_show_style_decision_making | game show style decision making]] with a clear winner-take-all incentive.

## The "Deal or No Deal" Challenge
With the help of Howie Mandel, the challenge took on a "Deal or No Deal" format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>. Contestants chose briefcases, some containing "safe" and others "eliminated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. The player holding the briefcase could either keep it or steal another's, influencing their own fate and others'.
*   Contestant 14, claiming their case was "safe," allowed 41 to steal it, which turned out to be true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. This act of honesty benefited 41 but reduced the overall odds for others.
*   Later, 14 claimed their next case was "eliminated," which was also true, leading to their elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>.
*   The 40s alliance, despite setbacks, showed strong bonds, with 43 choosing to reveal an "eliminated" case truthfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>.
*   Contestant 48, in a strategic move, lied about their case being "eliminated" when it was "safe," causing 51 to not steal and be eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>. This highlighted the role of deception in [[strategies_and_tactics_used_by_contestants | contestant tactics]].
*   The 96-year-old contestant also strategically lied about his case being "eliminated," leading to him staying in the game when his opponent chose not to steal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>.

## Final Eliminations: The Weight of Stories
Down to the top nine, contestants were required to justify why they deserved the prize money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>. This emotional challenge forced the group to vote out four people based on their personal stories and perceived needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>. This process was extremely difficult, leading to emotional distress among participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a>. The 40s alliance eventually imploded, with votes cast against its members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>.

## The Ultimate Challenge: Consensus or Destruction
The final five contestants were moved to a giant cube, with an hour on the clock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>. If more than one person remained when the timer hit zero, the $250,000 prize would be incinerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>. This put immense pressure on the remaining players to find a way to select a single winner.
After heated discussion and debate about who "deserved" the money, contestant 48 proposed a ranked-choice voting system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>. Each contestant would rank the others based on who they thought deserved the money most, and the most consistently top-ranked person would win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>. This [[winning_strategies_in_competitions | winning strategy]] allowed the group to make a decision without resorting to a stalemate.

Ultimately, contestant 47, who had demonstrated strong alliances and fought for others throughout the competition, was declared the winner based on the ranked-choice vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>. The remaining four finalists each received $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>. The competition highlighted varied [[contestant_strategies_and_dynamics | contestant strategies and dynamics]], from ruthless self-preservation to the formation of loyal alliances, and the complex nature of [[contestants_decision_making | decision-making]] under pressure.

## The Importance of Sign Language

Sign language serves as a vital tool, connecting people regardless of their hearing ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Addressing Limited Access

Despite its importance, access to learning sign language remains significantly limited in many regions worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. To combat this, a donation of $100,000 is being provided to various organizations globally that are dedicated to teaching sign language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

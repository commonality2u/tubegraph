Content creators frequently involve their subscribers in various [[challenge_to_win_money | challenges to win money]] or valuable prizes. These events often range from physical feats to strategic decisions, with the goal of providing significant financial rewards to participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The participants are often chosen from the subscriber base, encouraging more viewers to subscribe for future opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Featured Challenges

### House vs. Lamborghini Choice
A subscriber was given the choice between owning a Lamborghini or a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The house featured three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a kitchen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The participant chose the house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. It was later revealed that the house was worth $90,000 more than the Lamborghini, confirming the correct choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The winner expressed profound gratitude, noting that his family now has a home thanks to this opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This demonstrates a [[creative_ways_to_win_money_or_prizes | creative way to win money or prizes]].

### Pull-Up Bar Endurance Challenge
Considered the most physically demanding challenge, a participant earned $100 for every second they hung from a pull-up bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Hanging for 10 minutes would have resulted in a $60,000 payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The participant, David, successfully hung for 2 minutes and 25 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, earning $15,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### Dart Throwing for $100,000
A participant named Donald was given a dart and tasked with hitting a bullseye from behind a stack of $100,000 cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The shot was challenging due to the distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Despite a close attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>, he did not hit the bullseye and did not win the cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This represents a [[challenge_to_win_100000 | challenge to win 100000]].

### Safe Cracking Challenge
A contestant named Andrew was given a pickaxe and tasked with opening a large safe to retrieve valuable items inside before the end of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **First Safe:** Andrew successfully opened the initial safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>, revealing it to be filled with Orbeez <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
*   **Nested Safes:** Inside the Orbeez, a second, smaller safe was found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. The contents of this safe were debris and baby pictures of the content creator's friends (Chris, Chandler, and Karl) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Another, even smaller safe was found beneath the pictures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
*   **Final Prize:** Andrew successfully opened the final safe, winning $15,000 in real diamonds and $10,000 in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

Oscar chose to arm wrestle Karl for the $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a> and won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### "Punch You in the Face" Challenge (Mannequin Twist)
Sam was offered $1,000 or $10,000 if he would let Chandler punch him in the face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Sam chose the $10,000 option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The twist was that Chandler punched a mannequin disguised as Sam, rather than Sam himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Sam received the $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

A random McDonald's employee named Orlando, who was a subscriber, was selected to participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   **Burger Identification:** Orlando was blindfolded and presented with a McDonald's burger and a Burger King burger. He had to identify the McDonald's burger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. He correctly identified it without even tasting it, winning $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Three Steps Challenge:** As a subscriber, Orlando was given the option to risk his $5,000 to take "three steps" and potentially win $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. He successfully took three simple steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, doubling his winnings to $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

Contestants threw dodgeballs covered in paint at Karl, who was blindfolded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Each successful hit earned the thrower $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. One contestant hit Karl five times, and another hit him six times, winning $5,000 and $6,000 respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

The million-dollar hole was extremely far away and small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Cam had three throws.
*   **First Throw:** Cam aimed for $1,000 but missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Second Throw:** Cam was given an ear of corn as the throwing object for the million-dollar hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. He was initially inclined to go for $100 but was persuaded to aim higher with an extra $100 incentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. He then aimed for $10,000 but missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Outcome:** Cam did not win any money from the corn hole itself, but received $100 for not going for the $100 hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This is an example of [[golden_ticket_contest_and_challenges | golden ticket contest and challenges]].

This extraordinary 16-bedroom estate, valued at $30 million, is located in Massachusetts and consists of four different buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. The property's owner became wealthy by manufacturing candles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Main House Features
The main house includes multiple living rooms, with one described as particularly "grand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. It also features an "Oval Office" containing "The Way To Wealth" by Benjamin Franklin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The "Grand Kitchen" was stocked with custom MrBeast candles left by the owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. An unusual feature of the main building is the ability to hit golf balls directly off the roof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## Extensive Car Collection
The estate boasts two car garages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. One garage is filled with exotic cars, including numerous Lamborghinis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. An additional "army of cars" is stored in a second garage, which initially appeared to be an unlit basement area but was revealed to be an outdoor section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## Recreational Amenities
Beyond the main house and garages, the property offers a variety of recreational facilities:
*   **Indoor Tennis Court** An entire indoor tennis court is available within one of the buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Two-Story Arcade** The house features a two-story arcade, noted to be 20 times larger than the arcade found in the [[comparison_of_affordable_and_luxury_homes | $1 million house]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Basketball Court** A basketball court is also present, which is used for activities like ping pong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Indoor Waterpark** A highlight of the estate is its indoor waterpark, described as the feature that makes the property "truly special" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This waterpark is a significant area that extends far back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

A unique challenge was set up using a massive quantity of powdered milk and expired cereal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The primary container for this challenge was the [[building_the_worlds_largest_cereal_bowl | world's largest cereal bowl]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, which has a capacity of 2,000 gallons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Initial Setup and Observations
Before contestants entered, the powdered milk was poured into the bowl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The milk gave off a distinct smell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. An initial test of the milk described it as "disgusting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Following the milk, expired cereal was added to complete what was then declared the [[building_the_worlds_largest_cereal_bowl | world's largest bowl of cereal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Participant Descriptions
Participants described sitting in the mixture as being in a "pool of pee, sugar-dried milk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. After an hour, one participant noted they had peed three times in the mixture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Another mentioned the presence of "so much dust in the air" from the cereal, leading to tasting it when breathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### Cereal Additions and Consistency
More cereal was added to the bowl after an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, and at every hour interval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, due to the existing cereal becoming "very soggy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

Participants expressed their least favorite cereals in the mixture:
*   One contestant disliked the "Tony the Tiger" cereal, stating "they're not grrreat, they're just grr" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   Another disliked the Frosted Flakes, describing them as "plain, soggy, limp noodle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

### Environmental Conditions
As the challenge progressed, the temperature dropped, with the night's coldest point expected to reach roughly 58 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>, raising concerns about hypothermia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. The overall smell of the mixture also became quite bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Upon exiting the bowl, participants were noted to "smell like urine and milk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

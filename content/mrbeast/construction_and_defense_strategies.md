A significant challenge involved defending a new Lamborghini from a military-grade tank, with the owner given a credit card to spend limitlessly on defense materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The objective was to protect the car from missile strikes, with success meaning the owner would keep the vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Initial Defense Preparations

Adam, tasked with the defense, focused on a [[winning_strategies | strategy]] centered around "Stop Shell, win Lambo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. His first move involved commissioning a construction crew to build walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Wall Height** Adam requested all walls to be at least a foot over his head to protect against direct shots on the Lamborghini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Water Pools** Inspired by a *MythBusters* episode, Adam incorporated pools filled with water, believing they would significantly reduce the velocity of incoming rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Adapting to an Escalated Threat

Initially facing one tank, the challenge was significantly escalated to three tanks, targeting the Lamborghini from all sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This forced Adam to reconsider his [[strategies_in_highstakes_games | strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

Adam faced significant [[challenges_and_survival_strategies | challenges and survival strategies]] during his final night of construction, including limited resources and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. Despite the difficulties, he continued building through the night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

### Expanded Defense Measures
Over 24 hours, Adam expanded his defenses, [[using_unconventional_materials_for_defense | using unconventional materials for defense]]:
*   **Cinder Block Walls** Two cinder block walls were part of the initial plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Stacked Cars** He incorporated two layers of stacked cars, planning to use the engine blocks for increased stopping power against projectiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. By the end, he had stashed 20 more cars and built four additional walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   **Additional Pools** The defense included three pools of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, with two more giant pools added later, though one remained unfilled due to time constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **Sand** Adam also incorporated sand in some areas, believing it would make the structures harder to push over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

## Outcome of the Defense

The tank assault involved 20 real tank shells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **Pool Impact** The very first shot hit one of Adam's pools, causing the water to pour out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   **Deflection** Despite the cars not being strong enough to stop the rounds directly, they successfully deflected them away from the Lamborghini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   **Water's Role** A pool directly in front of the Lamborghini managed to catch a bullet, proving the effectiveness of water in defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.

Ultimately, the Lamborghini survived the tank barrage, allowing Adam to keep the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

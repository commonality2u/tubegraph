During a seven-day [[survival_challenges | survival challenge]] in an abandoned city, participants encountered several [[unexpected_events_and_complications_during_the_challenge | unexpected events and complications]] and [[surprise_elements_and_distractions_during_the_challenge | surprise elements]] that tested their nerves and provided moments of levity.

## Mysterious Sounds and Apparitions

### Nighttime Disturbances
On the first night in the abandoned city, Mark and the camera crew were awoken by the sound of breaking glass not far from their camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This immediately made the participants question if they were truly alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The sound left them wondering, "What was it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Spotting a Mysterious Figure
On the third day, while using a drone to seek a new shelter, the team stumbled upon an [[finding_a_random_person_challenge | unexpected guest]] â€“ they saw someone reflecting light under some stairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This confirmed their suspicion that they were not alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Despite the eerie atmosphere, they decided to investigate the building where the person was spotted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

The participants expressed concern about the potential danger, with one noting, "There's a very non-zero chance somebody could be in here and like attack us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. They spent the rest of the day searching for the "lurker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### The Prank Revealed
For five consecutive days, the participants heard sounds of broken glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. This persistent phenomenon was later revealed to be a prank orchestrated by Mark, who had been secretly dropping bottles through the roof using a remote control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. This [[unexpected_outcomes_in_challenges | unexpected outcome]] of a playful [[consequences_of_playful_punishments_in_challenges | punishment]] or distraction created tension and fear throughout the challenge.

## Animal Sightings

### The Curious Cat
While scouting for a new shelter with their drone on day three, the team discovered an [[surprise_elements_and_distractions_during_the_challenge | unexpected guest]]: a cat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The cat showed no apparent [[survival_challenges | survival]] instinct, even sniffing the drone camera when it landed nearby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Despite the amusement, the participants redirected their focus back to finding shelter due to dropping temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

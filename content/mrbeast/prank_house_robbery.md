The concept of pranking has always been a staple in entertainment, from candid camera shows to elaborate practical jokes. In a recent video, a prank of a different scale unfolded: a fake house robbery orchestrated by MrBeast with the unsuspecting target being none other than the father of his friend Chandler. This episode combined humor, suspense, and ultimately, a heartwarming ending.

## The Setup

In the video, the plan was set in motion with Chandler's dad, Todd, believing he was participating in one of MrBeast's signature "Last to Leave" challenges [[last_to_leave_challenge_in_cereal_bowl | Last to Leave Challenge]]. In reality, this was a decoy to keep Todd occupied. The real mission? To "rob" Todd's house, leaving him with a surprise waiting at the end. As MrBeast introduced the plan, he ensured viewers that everything was in good spirits and with permission from the entire family (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>).

## The Execution

Chandler and MrBeast, equipped with a rock for dramatic effect, shattered a window to kick off their faux robbery [[executing_elaborate_pranks_and_setups | Elaborate Pranks and Setups]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>). As the prank unfolded, an entire crew, including familiar faces like Carl and Tyler, helped empty the house of its contents—all to the amusement and chants of “We stay robbin’” (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>).

While the team was busy emptying the house, they coordinated with movers (under the guise of moving for "friend Rob") to ensure a large-scale operation that appeared convincingly like a break-in (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>).

## Attention to Detail

Adding to the comedic tone, the team did not just stop at removing furniture; they went to great lengths to stage a convincing scene that emphasized the joke. Fake broken windows, misplaced items, and even a removed toilet added to the hilarity. Chris humorously explained, “If you're gonna rob a house, you have to take the toilet. It's like a rule or something” [[humor_and_deception_in_challenges | Humor and Deception in Challenges]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>).

## The Big Reveal

Upon completion of the fake robbery, MrBeast and Chandler returned to declare Todd the winner of the challenge, thereby prompting him to return home to discover the surprise. As Todd entered his house, the hidden cameras captured his genuine shock and confusion, adding to the prank's efficacy and humor [[emotional_reaction_to_pranks | Emotional Reaction to Pranks]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>).

The "Military Evasion Challenge" pits Jimmy against a military squad in a high-stakes game of hide-and-seek, with $100,000 on the line for the squad if they successfully apprehend him before the end of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This amount is later increased to $150,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Jimmy has previously evaded a bounty hunter and the FBI, but never three different pursuers simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Challenge Setup and Early Evasion
The challenge begins with Jimmy getting a head start, having purposely parked the squad's car further away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### Obstacle Creation
*   **Bridge Demolition**: Jimmy instructs Chandler to blow up a bridge, the quickest way out of a field, giving Jimmy a five to ten-minute head start by forcing the squad to take a longer route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This is an act of [[obstacle_creation_and_evasion | obstacle creation]].

### Decoy Tactics
*   **Warehouse Jeep Decoy**: Jimmy leads the squad to a warehouse filled with jeeps, instructing his team members to drive in random directions when the squad arrives, creating confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This serves as a [[decoy_vault_and_challenges | decoy]] strategy.
*   **Hiding in Plain Sight**: While the squad breaches the warehouse, Jimmy hides under a blanket in a car inside the building, reclining his seat to make it harder to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Tracker Jamming**: Jimmy possesses a special bag that can jam his GPS tracker, temporarily hiding his location from the military squad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. This is a key [[escape_tactics_and_evasion_techniques | evasion technique]].
*   **Barn Escape**: Jimmy has an old barn constructed in the middle of nowhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. During this pursuit, Karl acts as a decoy by joining the military squad temporarily, saving Jimmy some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Rock Obstacle**: Jimmy attempts to use a terrain advantage, calculating that the squad's cars shouldn't be able to traverse certain rocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. However, the military squad successfully drives over the rocks, nullifying this [[obstacle_creation_and_evasion | obstacle creation]] plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Nolan as a Decoy**: While the military squad is distracted getting ice cream after a negotiation for more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, Jimmy buries Nolan alive with the tracker, leading the squad to believe Nolan is Jimmy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Jimmy even lies to the squad, claiming to be buried alive himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Hiding in the Woods**: Jimmy and Chris hide in the woods, with Chris acting as a minor decoy before being caught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Final Location: The Museum
Jimmy rents an entire museum as his final hiding spot, planning to utilize its multiple floors and various hiding places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. He hides below a makeshift rock formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Karl attempts to mislead the military squad about Jimmy's location within the museum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

## Outcome
The military squad ultimately finds Jimmy hidden in the museum because they spot his shoes sticking out from under the rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. Having won the $150,000, the squad announces their intention to donate the entire sum to the HunterSeven Foundation, which conducts research on toxic exposures for veterans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Nolan remains buried alive at the end of the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

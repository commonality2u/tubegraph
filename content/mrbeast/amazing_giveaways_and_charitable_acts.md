This article details various challenges and [[surprise_giveaways_and_prizes|surprise giveaways]] conducted as part of social media content, often featuring [[random_acts_of_kindness_and_generosity|random acts of kindness]] and significant [[charity_and_paying_it_forward|charitable donations]] to individuals and organizations in need. The primary mechanic involves participants attempting to fit as many items as possible into a defined shape on the ground, with all fitting items being paid for.

## The "Fit in the Shape" Challenge

Participants are challenged to select various items in a store and then fit them within a designated shape (e.g., a circle, square, or even a pizza slice) outlined on the floor or a table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. If all chosen items remain within the boundaries of the shape without touching the red tape, the items are paid for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This concept is used as a vehicle for [[giving_away_items_in_unique_and_entertaining_ways|giving away items in unique and entertaining ways]].

### Chandler's Initial Challenge

Chandler was offered anything he could fit into a circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He successfully acquired:
*   Two PlayStations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>
*   A T-Rex toy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>
*   Two Nintendo Switches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
*   A TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>
*   A waffle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>

He managed to stack all items vertically and within the circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Tyler's Square Challenge

Tyler participated in a similar challenge, where he was told the shape was a circle but it was actually a square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. He chose:
*   A $280 anime statue doll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>
*   A "pretty shield" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>

Tyler estimated the value of his chosen items to be around $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Despite initial panic, he successfully fit all items into the square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, with the host stating he had "zero faith" it would work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Grocery Shopping for a Soup Kitchen

A manager and treasurer of a local soup kitchen participated in a grocery shopping challenge to help with [[food_donation_and_community_support|food donation and community support]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Their soup kitchen is the only one in town and served about 35,000 meals the previous year, sometimes serving 240 people in one day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. They have about 75 volunteers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

They used a power jack to grab a whole pallet of water bottles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. The circle for this challenge was intentionally very large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> and magically extended to fit everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

In addition to all the groceries, the soup kitchen received a [[charitable_donations_in_competitions|charitable donation]] of a $20,000 check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. The manager was "totally overwhelmed" and stated, "this really has made our year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This act represents [[philanthropy_and_charity_prizes_in_social_media_content|philanthropy and charity prizes in social media content]].

### Stand in the Circle for $100

A [[unique_giveaways_and_competitions|unique giveaway]] was set up where people were asked to stand in a giant red circle for 10 minutes to receive $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Many people gathered in the circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a> and received their cash reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. One participant commented it was "low risk, high reward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

### Chandler's Pizza Slice Challenge

Chandler faced another challenge, this time with a much smaller "pizza slice" shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. He attempted to fit:
*   A wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>
*   An $1,800 Louis Vuitton bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>
*   Shoes (including $500 pink shoes and $570 green shoes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>
*   A $250 teddy bear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>
*   A $250 wire cutter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>
*   A $400 statue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>
*   A $30 brick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>
*   A $1,000 wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>

His attempt to stuff everything into the Louis Vuitton bag and place it on a wallet failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, and he was tackled, resulting in him losing the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

### Furniture for Flood Victims

John, whose house was affected by floods, participated in a furniture store challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. The water in his house had been 6 to 8 steps high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. The circle was very big at the furniture store because "furniture is big" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

John chose:
*   A bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>
*   Two lamps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>
*   A dining room set (including plates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>
*   A $3,000 bedroom set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>
*   A sofa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>

All the furniture successfully fit into the circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, with the total cost being almost $30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. This act of [[charitable_donations_to_people_in_need|charitable donations to people in need]] aimed to help him refurnish his flood-damaged home.

### The Wilkerson Family's Shopping Spree

The Wilkerson family, described as "in need," participated in a big box store challenge, where Chandler was given the task of drawing a large trapezoid (instead of a circle) to give them more space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

They chose many items, including:
*   A leg massager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>
*   $100 toothbrushes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>
*   Ninja blenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>
*   Fortnite merchandise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>

They filled 11 entire carts with items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. The family revealed they didn't have a car and had hospital bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. Everything they selected successfully fit within the large trapezoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

In addition to the shopping, they received a [[charitable_donations_to_people_in_need|charitable donation]] of a $10,000 check to cover hospital bills and help them buy a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. The family expressed immense gratitude, stating, "Ain't nobody never help me this much in my life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

### Deri's Donations for People with Learning Disabilities

Deri, who works with people with intellectual and developmental disabilities to help them become independent, participated in a challenge at an electronics store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. She chose items vital for those she helps, including:
*   Tablets, important for individuals who cannot speak for themselves or have difficulty with language output (e.g., those with autism) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.
*   Electric toothbrushes to assist with oral hygiene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
*   Fitbits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

She gathered many items for the "50, 75, [or] 100" people RSI (Residential Services, Inc.) works with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. All items fit into the small circle provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. Deri explained that these items would impact their lives in many ways, helping with oral health, noise cancellation, and enabling them to be active members of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

### Middle School Baseball Coach

A middle school baseball coach participated to get equipment for his team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. He chose:
*   A new catcher's mitt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>
*   Cleats for his players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>
*   A helmet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>
*   Two bats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>

He successfully fit all the items within the circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. Afterward, the items were presented as a [[surprise_giveaways_and_prizes|surprise giveaway]] to his baseball team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.

### Personal Shopping Spree

A female participant chose several items for herself:
*   A $400 hairdryer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>
*   An Xbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>
*   A hoverboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>

Despite the circle being smaller than she anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>, she managed to stack her final item, a hoverboard, on top, fitting everything successfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

### Chris's Baby Shopping

Chris, who was about to become a dad, participated in a baby store challenge to get items for his son, Tucker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. He chose:
*   Clothes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>
*   A car seat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>
*   Another baby item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>

The circle for this challenge was not as big as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>, but Chris successfully managed to stack all the baby items, including the car seat, within the boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

## The Money Stacking Challenge

In a variation of the "fit in the shape" concept, a participant was challenged to stack as much money as possible within a square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. If the stack fell, they would lose everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. The participant began with $600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>, eventually reaching $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>, then $4,400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>, and finally secured $5,000 by successfully balancing the stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. This challenge is another example of a [[unique_giveaways_and_competitions|unique giveaway]].

Overall, the video highlighted various [[unique_giveaways_and_competitions|unique giveaways]] and [[random_acts_of_kindness_and_generosity|random acts of kindness]] for individuals and organizations, with over $100,000 spent on items and [[charitable_donations_to_people_in_need|charitable donations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.

Modern challenges and games extensively utilize [[use_of_technology_and_gadgets_in_modern_treasure_hunts | technology and gadgets]] for tracking participants. One common method involves the [[use_of_tracking_devices | use of tracking devices]] to monitor movement across various locations.

## Tracking Devices
A primary method of tracking involved a GPS device placed directly on one of the participants, Jimmy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This device allowed the FBI agent and the other competitors ("the boys") to continuously know Jimmy's location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Real-time Location Monitoring
The GPS tracker provided real-time updates on Jimmy's position:
*   It showed when Jimmy turned left, providing the layout of a hedge maze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The competitors used this information to navigate the maze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   The tracker indicated Jimmy's presence on a hill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a> and later on the highway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   At a Walmart, the tracker confirmed Jimmy's presence inside the store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The competitors used the tracker to narrow down his location within the parking lot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   The tracker moving signaled that Jimmy's vehicle had left the Walmart parking lot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   Prior to boarding a private jet, the tracker showed Jimmy on a taxiing runway at the airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### Beyond GPS Tracking
While the GPS tracker was the primary tool, other methods were used to maintain tracking or gain information:
*   **Airport Information**: The FBI agent was able to directly inquire with airport personnel about the destination of Jimmy's private jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, learning it was headed to Washington, D.C. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Phone Communication**: Jimmy frequently called the competitors to taunt them or provide misleading information, which also served as a form of "check-in" regarding their proximity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Visual Confirmation**: At various points, direct visual confirmation was used, such as spotting Jimmy's jet taking off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a> or seeing him in the stadium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

## Limitations and Counter-Measures
Despite the advanced [[use_of_tracking_devices | tracking devices]], there were instances where the chase became challenging for the pursuers:
*   **Loss of Signal**: In a storage facility, the competitors had to go upstairs to regain service and check the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **Environmental Obstacles**: Physical barriers like a giant telephone pole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> and the complexity of a hedge maze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a> provided temporary hindrances.
*   **Disguises and Diversions**: Jimmy employed disguises, such as an "old man" outfit, to blend in at a Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. He also used tactics like popping the tires of the competitors' car to delay them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Deceptive Information**: At an NFL stadium, Jimmy used a pre-recorded video on loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a> and filled the stadium with mannequins to confuse his pursuers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. He even attempted to disguise himself as a mannequin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

The challenge highlighted how [[strategies_to_locate_someone_in_a_large_area | strategies to locate someone in a large area]] must adapt when technology is involved, blending digital tracking with physical observation and predictive tactics.

Luxury homes often distinguish themselves through an integration of unique art pieces and remarkable structural elements that transcend typical residential design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. These residences, ranging from multi-million dollar "art houses" to mega-mansions, feature custom designs and high-value installations, showcasing [[highend_amenities_in_multimillion_dollar_homes | highend amenities in multimillion dollar homes]] alongside their impressive scale. This section details some of the most striking examples found in high-value properties, contrasting with more modest dwellings as part of a [[comparison_of_affordable_and_luxury_homes | comparison of affordable and luxury homes]].

## The $69 Million "Art House"

This unusual $69 million mansion is notable for its distinct design, which is described as looking like a villain's lair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Its high market value is largely attributed to its contents and structural integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

### Priceless Art and Sculptures
The house is "filled to the brim with priceless art and sculptures sourced from all around the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Specific examples include:
*   A "big red sculpture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   A "one of one fully analog custom home sound system" crafted by the creator of the Walkman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. This system is considered an impressive and unique feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

### Unique Structural Resilience
Beyond its artistic contents, the house boasts an unusual and robust construction:
*   It has been "meticulously built to be able to withstand the force of a real tsunami" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
*   Movement within the house often requires walking across a "SkyBridge," contributing to its strange yet functional design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## The $139 Million Mega-Mansion

Referred to as possibly "the most luxurious house ever built by mankind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, this [[features_of_a_100_million_megamansion | 100 million megamansion]] (or 139 million as later corrected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>) spans 36,000 square feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a> and contains features rarely seen in other residences.

### Extraordinary Features
*   **Dinosaur Replica**: The mansion houses a T-Rex replica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, which is noted as a "real dinosaur" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
*   **Robotic Car Elevator**: An entire "robotic car elevator" allows for selection and delivery of vehicles directly to the garage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. This feature alone is valued at $2.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.
*   **Luxury Materials**: The house is constructed using "the most expensive materials on the planet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. For instance, the walls in one room are made "entirely out of rare marble, imported straight from Italy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>, and there is "not a single thing of drywall in this entire house" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   **Opulent Chandeliers**: The mansion features multiple chandeliers, including one worth over $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, and a total of $6 million worth of chandeliers throughout the house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. The weight of one chandelier was so significant that the ceiling began to dip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   **Ice Room**: The house includes an "ice room" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>, showcasing an unusual and highly specialized space.
*   **Giant Pool Screen**: The pool area features an "absurdly large" and "slow" screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a> which offers a dramatic effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a> and mirrors the view of Los Angeles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

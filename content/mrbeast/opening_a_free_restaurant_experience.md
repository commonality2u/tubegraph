The world's first free restaurant was opened, where customers not only received complimentary food but were also paid to eat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Initial Challenges and Overwhelming Demand
Before the restaurant even officially opened, police had to shut down a mile of traffic due to an estimated thousand cars already in line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The venture faced [[challenges_of_running_a_restaurant_for_the_first_time | challenges of running a restaurant for the first time]], as the organizer had no prior experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> and found cooking to be "way harder than I thought" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The team quickly realized that owning a restaurant was "actually kind of hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

Due to the immense and unexpected demand for free food, it became clear that the team had "severely underestimated how many people would come" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The address of the restaurant was never publicly shared; the crowds were drawn solely by a billboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The sheer number of people led to a 20-mile line of cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

> "There's no stalling, we're blocking traffic." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>

## Managing the Crowds and Giving Away Prizes
To manage the long waits and traffic, the team started distributing free burgers and money directly to cars in line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. When cooking couldn't keep up, money was given away instead of food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

The restaurant aimed to provide a unique and generous [[giving_away_cash_and_prizes_to_restaurant_customers | giving away cash and prizes to restaurant customers]] experience, beyond just free food:
*   **Cash Prizes** Hundred-dollar bills were given to customers for waiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Stacks of cash were distributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, and later $200,000 was given to one person to continue giving away money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Electronics** Customers were offered a choice between a burger and a bag containing AirPods and a significant amount of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, with the option to still receive food even if they chose the latter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. iPads were also given away to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Vehicles** A car was given to a family whose vehicle was side-swiped while they were waiting in line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
*   **Gas and Repairs** Gas was provided to cars that ran out while waiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, and $10,000 was given to a family to fix their broken-down car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

The staff expressed the stress of working in this unique [[drivethrough_experience_and_challenges | drivethrough experience and challenges]] setting, comparing it to fast food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Scaling Operations and Closure
Initially, friends were called in for help to make burgers, despite their lack of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Later, an "army" of professional chefs were brought in to increase efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. With the increased help, a second service window was opened to serve cars on both sides of the restaurant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

Ultimately, after discussions with local police, the restaurant decided to close early due to the significant traffic disruption it was causing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. The final customers received their burgers along with a significant amount of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

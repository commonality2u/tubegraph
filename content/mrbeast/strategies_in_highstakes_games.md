[[High Stakes Challenges | High stakes challenges]] often reveal diverse [[winning_strategies | winning strategies]] and unexpected human behavior. In a challenge where 100 participants, ranging from age 1 to 100, were trapped in individual glass cubes competing for half a million dollars, various [[strategies_and_tactics_used_by_contestants | strategies and tactics used by contestants]] emerged to outlast opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Initial Approaches and Mindsets
Participants entered the [[High Stakes Challenges | high stakes challenge]] with personal motivations and varying degrees of confidence:
*   A 31-year-old participant aimed to win for his daughter's third birthday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   A 69-year-old expressed immediate confidence in [[winning_strategies | winning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   Motivations included paying off student debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, showing strength to grandchildren <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, and achieving financial independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   A World War II veteran believed the challenge would be "peanuts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Early Game Dynamics and Psychological Warfare
One of the first observed [[high_stakes_challenge_strategies | strategies]] came from the younger contestants:
*   **Noise Strategy**: Kids employed a "crazy strategy" of making a lot of noise to prevent others from sleeping and encourage them to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This tactic proved effective, leading to early departures, especially among older participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> and even some children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Boredom and Isolation**: Leaving contestants alone for extended periods also prompted exits due to boredom and missing family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Participants developed ways to combat boredom, such as drawing on walls or building pillow forts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Voting and Deception in Challenges
Challenges introduced by the host often shifted the dynamics, testing alliances and revealing character. Many participants were willing to take risks to accelerate eliminations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

### Three Cup Monte
The first major challenge was a large-scale Three Cup Monte, where losing track of the ball led to elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Deception**: Some contestants deliberately gave wrong answers to their neighbors when asked for help, leading to tension and new rivalries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This highlighted a [[winning_strategies_in_contests | winning strategy]] of deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Consensus vs. Trust**: Some relied on group consensus for the correct answer, while others distrusted their peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

### Elimination Vote (Purge)
A more brutal challenge involved voting to eliminate another contestant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Retribution**: This challenge became a means for those who were lied to in the previous challenge to vote out the deceptive players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, suggesting that "it pays off to be honest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Targeting "Bad Apples"**: Contestants targeted those perceived as "cocky" or "ungrateful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **Alliances and Power Blocks**: The "50s" age group formed a strong alliance, demonstrating significant voting power and eliminating many in their 70s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. This allowed them to survive the entire voting game "untouched" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **Targeting Non-Threats**: Surprisingly, some groups targeted less threatening individuals, such as the 96-year-old, causing emotional distress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

### Jenga Challenge
A Jenga challenge required players to pull blocks from a tower without it falling, reducing the numbers to the top 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. This challenge relied on dexterity and precision rather than social [[Winning Strategies in Competitions | strategies]].

### Marble Game
Inspired by [[Highstakes game show formats | highstakes game show formats]] like "Squid Game," contestants played one-on-one marble games against their neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
*   **Gambling**: Some players chose "all or nothing" gambles despite having a significant lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.
*   **Fairness**: The game highlighted the role of luck and strategy, as a missing marble nearly eliminated a player, but was returned by a neighbor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

### Final Elimination Vote
For the final five, eliminated contestants voted on who should be removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
*   **Reputation Matters**: This challenge directly tested participants' social standing and how well they were liked by their peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. It showed the importance of maintaining good relationships throughout the competition, as past actions came back to influence outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

## The Final Bluff
The last two contestants faced a "game of bluffery" for the $500,000 prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. One player knew which of two briefcases contained the money and could choose to keep their own or steal the other's.
*   **Honesty vs. Deception**: The player with the money truthfully claimed to have it, but the opponent decided not to trust them, ultimately losing the prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. This highlighted [[the_role_of_luck_and_strategy_in_competitive_games | the role of strategy]] and trust, with the host remarking, "It pays off to be honest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>.

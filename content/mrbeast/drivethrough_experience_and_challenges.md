A unique [[high_stakes_challenges | challenge]] involved participants attempting to drive through a Hardee's drive-through 1000 times in a single day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The primary [[incentives_and_motivations_in_challenges | motivation]] and [[risk_versus_reward_challenges | risk]] for this endeavor was that if they failed to complete all laps before the end of the day, they would be forced to work at the restaurant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This served as a strong incentive to complete the grueling task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

## The Challenge Begins

The challenge commenced with the first trip, followed by 999 more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Early on, the team experienced initial fatigue and considered quitting, but resolved to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Adapting Strategies

As the day progressed, several strategies were employed to overcome the immense scale of the challenge:

*   **Vehicle Variety**
    *   Participants initially used a standard car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
    *   To increase efficiency and vary the experience, they later utilized a lawnmower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, a golf cart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, and even a girl's bike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
    *   A limo was rented to provide more space for the team and allow for naps during the continuous trips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Food Management and Donations**
    *   To avoid waste from the large volume of food orders, the team began stockpiling items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
    *   Food was donated to a local middle school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
    *   Later, they specifically ordered bottles of water and orange juice, which could easily be donated after the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
    *   A large order, including the entire menu, was placed and delivered to the local police department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. More food was also delivered to a hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Streamlined Ordering**
    *   To save time, a single credit card was given to the drive-through attendants, allowing them to charge it for each trip without needing constant swiping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
    *   Orders became increasingly specific and unusual, such as ordering just a bun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>, a patty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, or 10 pickles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a> to build a custom burger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
    *   One participant ordered items alphabetically, starting with "apple sauce" and ending with "zero Coke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

## The Toll of Repetition

The challenge took a significant physical and mental toll on the participants:
*   Exhaustion set in, with Chandler feeling numb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a> and the team being awake for eight hours, feeling "dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   Chandler needed to use the restroom multiple times throughout the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   The continuous driving around became frustrating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

## Interactions with Staff

The drive-through staff experienced the repetitive nature of the challenge firsthand. Initially, they might have questioned the bizarre activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, but eventually, they seemed to accept the unusual situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. By the end, they were tired but appreciative of the effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a> and even cheered the participants on the final lap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. One attendant, Latonia, revealed her name on the 999th lap, expressing that she would likely never see the participants again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

## Conclusion

After 14 hours, starting at 7 AM and finishing at 9 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>, the team successfully completed all 1000 laps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. On the final lap, the team gave the staff additional money for their patience and cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. The experience left the participants vowing never to eat fast food again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

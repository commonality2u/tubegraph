A competitive challenge was organized where participants had the opportunity to win a substantial prize of $100,000 by pressing a button that could either grant the money or impose a random punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The stated purpose of the prize was to be given to the winner's sister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Participants' Motivations

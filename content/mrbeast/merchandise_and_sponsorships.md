## Merchandise

MrBeast's channel utilizes merchandise as a way to engage with its audience and fund its large-scale productions. The brand sells general merchandise, including apparel, and also produces specific items like "chocolate bars" [00:06:57].

To celebrate reaching "100 million subscribers" [00:00:00], MrBeast launched a special "limited edition 100 million subscriber merch" collection [00:12:42]. This collection was advertised as potentially being the "only merch drop of the entire year" [00:12:46]. A unique incentive for purchasing this specific merchandise was access to an unreleased MrBeast video that "will never be uploaded to the public" [00:12:50]. This video cost "over half a million dollars" [00:15:22] to produce. Purchasers receive a link to watch this video via email [00:12:52], with a "seven days" [00:12:54] window to buy the merchandise for access.

The main prize in the island competition, the deed to the private island, was "Taped to the back" [00:11:16] of MrBeast's actual "100 million subscriber play button" [00:11:14], symbolizing over "a decade" [00:14:46] of work.

## Sponsorships

Sponsorships play a role in supporting the production of MrBeast's content.

### Shopify
Shopify is highlighted as a platform that simplifies starting a business [00:06:34]. MrBeast notes that he has "personally been using Shopify to sell merch since we had three million subscribers" [00:06:53]. The platform's features include ease of use via a phone [00:06:36] and the ability to "sell online, in person, and through social media" [00:08:36].

As a promotional offer, MrBeast pledged to be the "first customer" [00:09:00] for 100 random people who create a Shopify store using the specified link [00:08:56]. This demonstrates a direct [[participant_incentives_and_offers | incentive]] tied to the sponsorship.

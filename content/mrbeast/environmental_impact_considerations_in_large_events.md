In the context of large-scale events, producers sometimes consider environmental impact. For a video production involving a private jet, the following measures were taken:

## Carbon Emission Offsetting

*   All carbon emitted during the filming of the video was offset by tenfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. This highlights a commitment to [[importance_of_environmental_responsibility | environmental responsibility]].
*   Any future carbon emissions generated by the private jet's winner are also planned to be offset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

Following a private jet crash that left survivors stranded in the middle of nowhere, technology played a crucial role in their efforts to manage resources and signal for rescue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The average time for a rescue team to find plane crash survivors is 31 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This scenario highlights aspects of [[survival_in_the_wilderness | survival in the wilderness]] and the [[use_of_technology_and_gadgets_in_modern_treasure_hunts | use of technology and gadgets]].

## Exploration and Resource Identification

A key piece of equipment utilized for [[outdoor_survival_skills | outdoor survival skills]] and exploration was a drone, initially intended for capturing drone shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

-   **Scouting the Area**: The drone was repurposed to scout the surrounding area, providing an aerial view of the dense tree cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This [[use_of_technology_in_tracking | use of technology in tracking]] helped overcome the limitations of ground exploration.
-   **Locating Water Source**: Critically, the drone identified a water source, specifically a river, from above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This was vital given the severe dehydration experienced by the survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
-   **Thermal Camera Experimentation**: The drone also featured a thermal camera, which was tested to see if messages written on the ground could be detected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. While not immediately practical for rescue, this demonstrated the potential for [[use_of_tracking_devices | use of tracking devices]] in communication.

## Signaling for Rescue

With time running out, and rescue expected around the 31-hour mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, the survivors focused on signaling their location.

-   **Flare Gun**: A flare gun was discovered among the plane's resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a> and used to launch a flare into the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
-   **Helipad Construction**: To prepare for a helicopter rescue, the team worked to build a helipad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This involved clearing and burning grass to create an "H" shape, making an obvious landing spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
-   **Helicopter Rescue**: The arrival of the rescue helicopter after 31 hours marked the successful conclusion of the ordeal, indicating the effectiveness of the signaling efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

## Challenges and Limitations

Despite the aid of technology, the [[challenges_of_extreme_survival_scenarios | challenges of extreme survival scenarios]] were significant. Resource scarcity, particularly the limited food and water stocked on a private jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, led to severe dehydration and hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. The need for [[resource_management_in_survival_situations | resource management in survival situations]] and rationing was immediate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. While technology like the drone aided in [[finding_food_and_resources_in_the_wild | finding food and resources in the wild]], the direct provision of these was limited. The overall experience was described as "way harder" than other extended wilderness challenges, primarily due to the lack of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The importance of [[improvisation_and_resourcefulness_in_survival_situations | improvisation and resourcefulness in survival situations]] was also evident, such as using the plane's engine as a fire pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

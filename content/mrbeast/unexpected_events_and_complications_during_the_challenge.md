The 100-day circle challenge presented a variety of [[psychological_and_physical_challenges | physical]] and mental obstacles for the participant, Shawn, beyond merely surviving in a designated area. These [[unexpected_outcomes_in_challenges | unexpected events]] and complications were often introduced by the hosts or arose from the living conditions.

### Initial Setup Challenges
The placement of Shawn's house, dropped by a crane with "zero training" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, caused initial problems. The imprecise drop resulted in his shower not draining properly, a long-term nuisance for the duration of the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### Environmental Difficulties
Shawn faced significant environmental challenges, including:
*   **Weather:** A tornado watch prompted questions about whether he would leave the circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The house experienced severe leaks from the ceiling and issues with the toilet flushing due to rain filling the outdoor tank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Proximity to the Red Line:** The "red line" marking the circle's boundary was a constant threat, as touching it meant "game over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Shawn created a secondary wooden line to provide an extra safety buffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, though he still had multiple near-misses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. He even considered digging a moat to reinforce the boundary after a particularly close call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### Interference and Distractions
The hosts and crew frequently introduced [[surprise_elements_and_distractions_during_the_challenge | surprise elements]] and distractions, often with the intent to bother or test Shawn:
*   **Camera Monitoring and Privacy:** Over a dozen cameras monitored Shawn 24/7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, leading him to hide when using the restroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a> and cover the camera in his bedroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   **Pranks and Vandalism:**
    *   The crew locked themselves in Shawn's house, making a mess and covering his yard in glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
    *   A spider was placed in his bed, prompting him to flip his bed over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
    *   On day 50, a marching band was brought in and paid to play all night to disturb him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
    *   Fireworks were set off on July 4th, impacting his visibility and safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
    *   Speakers were placed around the circle playing annoying sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.
    *   Clowns surrounded his house and stayed all night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.
*   **House Demolition:** In the final days, parts of Shawn's house were systematically destroyed with a wrecking ball and excavator, removing his roof just before rain was expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

### Personal and [[psychological_and_physical_challenges | Psychological Challenges]]
Beyond the external [[surprise_elements_and_distractions_during_the_challenge | distractions]], Shawn grappled with internal struggles:
*   **Loneliness and Family Separation:** Shawn found notes from his daughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a> and stated that the loneliness of being away from his wife and four children would be the hardest part of the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Father's Day was particularly difficult due to missing his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. A surprise visit from his family provided a much-needed emotional boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Food Rationing:** With only 300,000 calories provided for 100 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, Shawn had to make "interesting choices" for meals, including boiling leftovers for safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. He experienced significant weight loss, dropping 22 pounds by day 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
*   **Boredom and Existentialism:** As the challenge progressed, Shawn ran out of things to do within the 60-foot circle, having dug a moat, made a garden, and a hammock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. He described himself as "just here existing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

Despite these ongoing complications, Shawn remained committed to completing the [[survival_challenges | challenge]] and earning the $500,000 prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

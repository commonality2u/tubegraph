A competition was held where participants, referred to as "the boys," competed in a series of challenges with the ultimate goal of winning a $100,000 cash prize for their dads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The competition featured various rooms, tasks, and unexpected twists in the [[winners_and_prizes_distribution | prize distribution]].

## Initial Deception: The Decoy Vault

The challenge began with a bank vault containing over $100,000, sealed shut with a key as the only way to open it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The first person to touch the vault would win its contents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Chris was the first to touch the vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. However, he received nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, as it was revealed to be merely a decoy vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This set the tone for the [[impact_of_surprise_rewards_and_twist_in_game_shows | surprising outcomes]] throughout the competition.

## Series of Challenges and Unforeseen Rewards

Participants then progressed through multiple challenges, each associated with a different "safe" or vault. The [[prize_distribution_and_winners_intentions | prize distribution and winners intentions]] for each segment varied.

### Laser Maze Challenge
In this challenge, participants had to navigate a room filled with lasers without touching them. Nolan successfully completed the laser maze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The prize for winning was a Tesla for his dad, conditional on also winning the $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Garage Door Obstacle
Blindfolded, the boys had to run under a falling garage door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Karl was the first to make it through and touch the safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. His dad won $10,000 in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Lego Mountain Key Hunt
Participants used Legos to build up to a dangling key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Chandler managed to grab the key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. The outcome for winning this safe was a conditional "kick" from the competition if he didn't win the *next* challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Second Laser Room (Chandler's Challenge)
This challenge was specifically focused on Chandler, who had to cross a laser room where the lasers disappeared and reappeared at short durations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. If he touched a laser, he and his dad would be out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Chandler successfully navigated the room, even through a section with no break in the laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Despite the effort, he won nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a> but avoided being kicked out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

### Electric Wire Maze (Trick)
A vault was "protected" by wires that supposedly reacted to metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, making them seem dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Chris fearlessly ran through them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, thinking he had won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, but the competition moved on due to perceived cheating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This highlighted the [[impact_of_surprises_and_moral_lessons_in_competitions | impact of surprises]] and competitive dynamics.

### Group Vote for Key Opener
In this room, participants voted for who among them would open the safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, with the rule that they couldn't vote for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Nolan received two votes from the others and was chosen to open the safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. The outcome for this vault was that the next room would involve a metal detector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### Buried Key in Sand
Participants used metal detectors to find a key hidden in a giant beach of sand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Though the key broke after being found, it still counted as a win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. The prize was a $5,000 Home Depot gift card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## Final Challenge and Grand Prize

The final challenge brought the boys back to the initial room, but with modifications like nails to prevent climbing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. The big vault, initially a decoy, was now filled with the $100,000 cash prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The rule remained: whoever touched it first would win what was inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

After navigating broken glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>, Nolan was the first to touch the vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. He successfully unlocked it and revealed the $100,000 prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, which was for his dad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. This represented the [[final_results_and_prize_distribution | final results and prize distribution]] of the main challenge.

A significant effort was made to ensure every dog in a particular shelter found a home, launching a large-scale marketing campaign to achieve this goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The initiative aimed to find loving homes for dogs such as Foxtrot, Winston, Iris, Monica, Taffy, Didi, Zeppelin, Grumpy, Tommy, Jive, Noah, Pepper, and Kelly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## [[dog_adoption_efforts_at_a_shelter | Marketing and Promotion for Adoptions]]

To increase traffic to the shelter and facilitate adoptions, various marketing strategies were employed:
*   **Billboards**: A billboard was purchased to direct more people to the shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The initial billboard proved surprisingly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, leading to the purchase of 50 more billboards later in the campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Flyers**: Flyers were created and distributed around town with a clear message: "Yield, we have doggos, go adopt them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Box Truck**: A large box truck was utilized to help the dog shelter, similar to a previous project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Professional Photos**: Professional photographs were taken of all the dogs to be used for new billboard designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **Radio Interview**: A radio station interview was conducted by a team member named Ethan, chosen because he was not widely known, ensuring people adopted dogs for genuine reasons rather than due to the "Beast Crew" association <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Live Mascot**: A team member dressed in a dog costume stood outside the shelter holding a "Cute Doggos Inside" sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

These combined efforts were part of a "biggest marketing campaign" with the explicit goal of not stopping until all dogs found homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The effectiveness of the [[impact_of_marketing_campaigns_for_pet_adoption | marketing campaign]] was evident as more families arrived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, with a surge in visitors once the additional billboards were up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

## [[successful_adoption_stories_and_incentives | Successful Adoption Stories and Incentives]]

Each adoption was met with celebration and often, [[experiences_of_receiving_unexpected_gifts | unexpected gifts]] for the new owners:

*   **Iris**: The first dog to be adopted, Iris, found a home quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Her new owner received 10 years' worth of dog food as a congratulatory gift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Gia**: After six months at the shelter, Gia was adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Her new family was given $5,000 as a thank you, an unexpected amount that could greatly assist with her care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   **Didi**: A family adopted Didi, and they received a sponsor's reward for their decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Zeppelin**: Zeppelin was adopted by a family who brought their current dog to meet him to ensure compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. They received an unstated but large incentive package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **Jive**: After a period of bonding, Jive was adopted, and the new owners received 10 years of pet insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **Tommy**: Tommy quickly found a home after warming up to a couple who threw a ball with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. They were given a $10,000 Petco gift card as a congratulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   **Kelly**: A super shy dog, Kelly, was adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Her adoption fee of $275 was waived, and the adopters received a $10,000 Petco gift card to ensure Kelly had a great life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **Winston (and Monica)**: Two families arrived simultaneously, with one interested in Winston and the other in Monica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Both dogs were adopted, with their adoption fees waived ("buy zero, get one free") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Winston, affectionately called "Lady" by his new owner, an older Lab, was chosen specifically because older dogs are often overlooked and deserve a good home in their later years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
*   **Grumpy (Swaggy)**: A team member adopted Grumpy, renaming him Swaggy, having already filled out the paperwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Noah**: Noah was adopted by a family who received a substantial amount of dog food and toys as a parting gift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   **Taffy**: Taffy was officially adopted, and the new owners were surprised with a $10,000 Petco gift card and unlimited dog food and toys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.
*   **Pepper**: Pepper was adopted, and her new owners received $5,000 worth of extra items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
*   **Foxtrot**: Foxtrot was also adopted, with her new owners receiving enough food to last "until he's like 30" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.
*   **Pinky**: The last dog remaining, Pinky, was adopted by a team member, Maddy, who felt a strong connection to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

### The Adoption Process

Before any dog was given to a new owner, every single person who adopted a dog was thoroughly vetted, which included filling out applications and other necessary procedures to ensure the dogs went to suitable homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

## Emotional Impact of Adoptions

The adoptions brought about a range of emotions for the shelter staff and the crew involved. Gia's departure was particularly touching, as the staff, who had cleaned and loved her for six months, gathered to say goodbye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Chandler, a team member, became very attached to Jive, expressing sadness and crying when Jive was adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. The overall sentiment was one of excitement and joy as dogs found their "nice loving homes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## [[collaborations_and_support_for_nokill_shelters | Continued Support for No-Kill Shelters]]

Even after all dogs in this specific shelter were adopted, the collaborating company, Furkids, a no-kill shelter, still had many other facilities with numerous dogs in need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. Donations were encouraged, with every dollar going towards building bigger facilities to help thousands more dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. The work done by Furkids was described as an "absolute miracle," with nothing similar having happened in their 19-year history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

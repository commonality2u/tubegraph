The "Keep Your Hand on the Private Jet" challenge, valued at two and a half million dollars, involved eleven YouTubers competing to be the last person with a hand on the aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Throughout the challenge, various [[strategies_and_tactics_used_by_contestants | strategies and tactics]] were employed to eliminate contestants, ranging from direct inducements to environmental manipulations and rule changes.

## Early Eliminations & Psychological Play
The initial rules were simple: participants could not push each other, and anyone taking their hand off was eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
*   **Accidental Slip** Vik was the first to be eliminated when his hand visibly lifted from the jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Bribery and Collateral Elimination** To entice contestants to leave, Chunkz was offered a debit card with a $10,000 spending limit if he took his hand off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This offer indirectly led to Speed's elimination when he high-fived Chunkz upon his departure, causing Speed's hand to leave the jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This incident highlights a [[creative_rules_for_winning_prizes | creative rule]] application that also served as a [[creative_approaches_in_winning_prizes | creative approach in winning prizes]] for some.

## Environmental Manipulation and Physical Stress
As the challenge progressed, external factors were introduced to increase discomfort and encourage eliminations.
*   **Moving the Jet** The jet was moved around the airport, forcing contestants to maintain their grip while in motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Bathroom Break Challenge** A "bucket method" was introduced for bathroom breaks, requiring contestants to relieve themselves while keeping one hand on the jet, adding a unique physical and logistical challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Restricted Movement** Contestants were made to move around the jet, including crawling under parts of it, making comfortable positions harder to maintain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **In-Cabin Pressure** Once inside the jet, contestants were made to do laps around the plane, continuing to exert physical pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   **The Flight** The jet was taken into the air, flying in circles for hours to create disorientation and discomfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. One contestant was eliminated during this flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## Strategic Challenges and Rule Adjustments
Further [[creative_challenges_for_entertainment | creative challenges for entertainment]] were introduced to break the stalemate among the remaining contestants.
*   **Difficult Dining** Contestants were provided with food like steak and spaghetti, along with wooden forks, making it challenging to eat with only one hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   **Forced Pairing and Isolation** The five remaining contestants were instructed to pair up, leaving one person isolated, which could affect individual [[creative_hiding_strategies_and_outcomes | creative hiding strategies and outcomes]] or support systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Standing Order** Contestants were forced to stand up after getting too comfortable in their positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   **Reduced Surface Area (Red Tape)** Red tape was applied to the jet, reducing the permitted surface area for contestants' hands. Touching or going below the red line resulted in elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. This is a direct example of [[creative_rules_for_winning_prizes | creative rules for winning prizes]].
*   **Coin Flip Elimination** Contestants introduced the idea of a coin flip to eliminate one of them, with the loser taking their hand off the jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. This was a [[creative_problemsolving_in_extreme_challenges | creative problemsolving in extreme challenge]] from the contestants' side.
*   **Single Finger Rule** To escalate the difficulty, participants were required to keep only one pointer finger on the jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>, significantly increasing the physical strain.
*   **Forced Orientation** Contestants were asked to turn and face a specific direction, altering their body position and making it harder to maintain contact with the jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

Ultimately, these combined tactics and challenges led to the progressive elimination of contestants until only one winner remained, Harry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

Staying in ultracheap hotels, particularly those priced as low as $1 per night, presents significant [[challenges_of_isolation | challenges]]. These accommodations offer only the most basic necessities and often come with unexpected difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Accommodations and Comfort
The "room" in a $1-a-night hotel in India consists solely of a mat on the floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. While comparable to a home mattress, it offers no comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The setup is more akin to sleeping in a hallway than a private room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Lack of Services and Privacy
Basic hotel services, such as room service, are non-existent in these ultracheap establishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Privacy is also severely limited, as people frequently step over guests during the night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

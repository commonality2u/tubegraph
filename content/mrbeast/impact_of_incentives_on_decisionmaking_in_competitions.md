Incentives play a crucial role in influencing the [[decision_making_and_the_impact_of_monetary_incentives | decision-making processes]] of participants in competitive environments. This dynamic was prominently showcased in a challenge conducted by popular content creator Mr. Beast, where 100 adults and 100 kids were invited to stay in two massive cubes for a duration of 100 hours. The primary goal was to have the most remaining participants to win a share of a $500,000 prize. Here we dissect how different [[strategies_for_longterm_endurance_challenges | incentives affected the participants' decisions]] throughout the competition.

## Monetary Incentives

From the outset, Mr. Beast established a financial incentive structure that laid the foundation for participant behavior. The overall prize was a hefty $500,000, which alone was a significant motivator to remain in the competition. However, Mr. Beast introduced a twist early on by offering $1,000 for participants to leave voluntarily within the first hour of the challenge (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>).

> The immediate offer of $1,000 led to 22 participants exiting the challenge: 12 adults and 10 kids (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>). This demonstrated the effectiveness of short-term financial incentives in altering participant behavior.

## Non-Monetary Incentives

As the challenge progressed, Mr. Beast introduced non-monetary incentives like food. For example, the offer to replace infamously disliked oatmeal with pizza in exchange for shrinking the participants' space was a [[psychological_strategies_in_contests | strategic incentive affecting their environment]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>). 

### Psychological Strategies

The psychological impact of incentives was further explored when Mr. Beast introduced tactics such as offering briefcases presumed to contain money to tempt participants to leave, capitalizing on curiosity and the allure of immediate gain (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>). These briefcases were empty, yet their presentation showcased how perceived value alone can alter decision-making.

## Social and Emotional Incentives

Throughout the duration of the challenge, social dynamics and emotional connections also played pivotal roles. Participants were allowed to send messages and communicate with loved ones through a makeshift "pipe" system ([impact_of_family_and_loved_ones_during_endurance_tests | reinforced communal bonds]) (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>), which reinforced communal bonds and emphasized endurance over individual exit strategies.

## Incentives and Competitive Strategy

The introduction of a giant button mechanism, which allowed one team to shrink the opposing teamâ€™s zone if pressed first, injected a [[strategy_and_tactics_for_endurance_challenges | competitive strategy]] into the challenge (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>). This mechanism added a layer of strategic thinking as participants weighed the risk of potential space reduction against the benefit of pressing the button.

## Conclusion

The competition underscored how a mix of [[competitive_challenges_with_financial_incentives | monetary, non-monetary, and psychological incentives]] can greatly influence decision-making in a competitive setting. Participants were consistently balancing the allure of immediate rewards with the strategic focus on the final prize. This challenge provided a vivid demonstration of the complexity and variability in [[decision_making_under_pressure | human decision-making when influenced by diverse types of incentives]]. Ultimately, the adults triumphed by [[adapting_living_conditions_for_a_prolonged_stay | remaining more adaptable]] to the evolving conditions and motivating factors introduced throughout the challenge.

This article details the various challenges and [[hide_and_seek_strategies | hiding strategies]] employed during a high-stakes challenge where Jimmy attempts to evade an FBI agent and his team to keep $100,000 before midnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The challenge involves numerous locations and creative evasion tactics.

## Initial Evasion and Roadblock

The chase begins with Jimmy and Tareq speeding through the woods to a waiting getaway car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The first obstacle Jimmy creates for his pursuers is a giant telephone pole, which he tips over to block their path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The FBI agent and the boys are forced to push the pole aside to continue the chase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Hedge Maze Strategies

The next location is a massive hedge maze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Jimmy utilizes his prior knowledge of the maze, having navigated it ten times before, giving him a significant advantage over the boys who have never been there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Key [[hide_and_seek_strategies | hiding strategies]] in the maze include:
*   **Misdirection:** Jimmy leaves money as a decoy to make the boys think they are following the correct path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Secret Exits:** To escape quickly, Jimmy reveals a secret door previously installed, allowing them to bypass the main exit used by maze personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

The boys use a GPS tracker placed in Jimmy's underwear to monitor his location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Walmart Disguise and Diversion

At Walmart, Jimmy implements a [[strategic_disguises_and_getaways | strategic disguise]] by transforming into "Boomer Jim" with a wig, hat, glasses, and cane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. He also disguises the $100,000 backpack by placing it inside another bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

Simultaneously, Tareq creates a diversion by popping a tire on the boys' car with a pickax, delaying their pursuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Despite Jimmy's close call, being one aisle away from the boys, his disguise and Tareq's actions allow for their escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Airport Escape

To gain a significant lead, Jimmy plans an escape via a private jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. The flat tire caused by Tareq further delays the boys, giving Jimmy ample time to board and take off as they arrive at the airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. The FBI agent leverages his authority to discover Jimmy's destination: Washington, D.C. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

## Storage Locker and Transportation

In Washington, D.C., Jimmy hides in a storage locker he recently purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. He places a cryptic sign: "Time is running out. I was in the box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. His strategy involves hiding with Tareq inside shipping boxes, being transported out of the facility in a box truck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. This method of transportation is notably slow, creating a risk of being caught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

## Private Island Chase

The next location is a private island accessible by boat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Jimmy attempts to mislead the boys with a phone call, making them believe he is nearby when he is actually already on a boat to the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. The boys pursue using slow swan boats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, while Jimmy feigns a broken boat to further trick them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Once on the island, Jimmy and Tareq get lost, needing assistance from island residents to find their way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## NFL Stadium Hide-and-Seek

The final and largest location is a rented NFL stadium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. This presents a massive [[strategies_and_hiding_spots_in_large_areas | large-area hiding challenge]].

Jimmy's [[creative_hiding_strategies_and_outcomes | creative hiding strategies]] in the stadium include:
*   **Decoys:** Filling the stadium with mannequins to confuse the boys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **Psychological Warfare:** Playing a pre-recorded video of himself on a loop, taunting them with "You'll never find me in this stadium. Losers." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   **Voice Manipulation:** Cutting the audio of his message remotely to indicate his presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   **Bluffing:** Telling the boys he could be "literally anywhere" in the 70,000-seat stadium with unlimited rooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   **Quick Movement and Knowledge of Layout:** Using an unknown "back way" to escape when discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.
*   **Disguise and Immobility:** Changing into mannequin clothes and posing as a mannequin to blend in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

Despite the boys' use of the tracker and their concerted efforts to search the vast stadium, Jimmy's elaborate strategies and last-minute disguise allow him to evade capture until the time runs out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

## Challenges Faced by the Seekers

The FBI agent and the boys faced numerous [[challenges_and_survival_strategies | challenges]] throughout the chase:
*   **Physical Obstacles:** Dealing with the fallen telephone pole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **Misdirection:** Being led astray by decoy money in the maze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Sabotage:** Having their car tire popped, causing significant delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Logistical Difficulties:** Unable to find a flight to Washington, D.C., forcing them to drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Deception:** Being tricked by a helpful stranger who leads them to a basement in the storage facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   **Slow Transportation:** Having to use very slow swan boats on the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Confusing Environment:** Navigating a massive stadium filled with mannequins and pre-recorded messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **Non-functional Equipment:** Escalators in the stadium not working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   **Time Constraint:** The overarching pressure of the clock ticking down, with only two and a half hours left by the time they reached the stadium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

Ultimately, Jimmy's elaborate and multi-faceted [[high_stakes_challenge_strategies | strategies]] allowed him to win the [[high_stakes_challenges | high-stakes challenge]] and keep the money.

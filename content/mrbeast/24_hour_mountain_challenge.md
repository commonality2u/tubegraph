A group undertook a [[highstakes_physical_challenges | high-stakes physical challenge]] to spend 24 hours on top of one of America's tallest mountains, reaching an elevation of over 6,000 feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The endeavor required a significant climb before the 24-hour period could even begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## The Ascent

The climb commenced on the Grandfather Trail, marked by a blue diamond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Participants faced challenging sections, including climbing rocks and navigating deep drops, which were particularly scary for those afraid of heights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

The hike proved arduous, with one participant stating they had been walking for three hours and couldn't feel their legs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The trail also included multiple ladders, some of which posed a significant risk of falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. As they ascended, the views improved dramatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

## Summit Challenges and Camp Setup

Upon reaching the peak, the team found the oxygen incredibly thin after walking for over three hours, leading them to set up camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. The high altitude meant clouds were literally on their campsite, causing lightheadedness if deep breaths weren't taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>.

Key issues included:
*   **Water Shortage**: Due to excessive water consumption during the ascent, the team faced a severe water shortage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. A "special ops team" was dispatched to find a spring one mile away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. They eventually located water from a black pipe hanging out of a rock, which tasted clean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.
*   **Food Scarcity**: Despite ordering pizza, the team also had to rely on foraging, with one member retrieving SpaghettiOs after a "wrestle with a bear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>. A fire was eventually lit to cook the food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>.
*   **Pizza Delivery**: A Domino's pizza was ordered to the mountain peak, which took the delivery person approximately six hours to deliver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>. The pizza arrived just before dark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.

Throughout these [[survival_challenges | survival challenges]], the team exhibited various [[competition_dynamics_in_endurance_challenges | competition dynamics in endurance challenges]], with some members taking on leadership roles and others focusing on "getting content" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.

## Overnight and Descent

The group shared tents, with temperatures expected to drop as low as 45 degrees Fahrenheit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>. Despite fears of bears and thin air, they survived the night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>.

The following morning, with limited food (a few granola bars, beef jerky, and a Snickers bar) and water, the team decided to descend the mountain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:00">[14:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a>.

## Hiking Ethics

The experience concluded with an important message on responsible hiking:
*   Stay on designated trails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>.
*   Follow regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>.
*   Never damage or deface vegetation, rocks, or natural resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>.
*   Stay clear of wildlife and never feed them, as it impacts their natural actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:00">[14:53:00]</a>.
*   Ensure personal impact on the land is positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>.

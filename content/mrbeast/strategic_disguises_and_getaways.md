Throughout the challenge, various [[escape_tactics_and_evasion_techniques | escape tactics and evasion techniques]] and [[challenges_and_hiding_strategies | hiding strategies]] are employed, combining unexpected movements with elaborate setups to evade pursuers. The strategy often involves a rapid change of location, the use of unconventional transportation, and the implementation of disguises or decoys.

## Initial Getaway and Maze Escape

The initial phase of the challenge begins with a swift departure from the starting point.

*   **Getaway Car**
    A car, described as a "getaway car" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, is used for the initial escape from the woods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
    > "Our getaway car is over here." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>

*   **Roadblock Tactic**
    A large telephone pole is strategically placed to block the exit path for the pursuers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This requires the pursuers to physically move the obstruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, gaining time for the escapees.

*   **Hedge Maze Navigation**
    The second location is a large hedge maze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The escapees navigate the maze using prior knowledge of its layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, while the pursuers are unfamiliar with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Money is left as a decoy to indicate the correct path to the pursuers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
    > "Look at how huge this maze is. We gotta be careful because it'd be easy to get lost and for them to catch us in here." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>

*   **Secret Maze Exit**
    To ensure escape from the maze, a "secret door" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a> was installed the day before, allowing a swift exit to a designated "Jimmy's Getaway Car" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, bypassing the main exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Disguise and Diversion at Walmart

A significant shift in strategy occurs at Walmart, focusing on [[creative_hiding_strategies_and_outcomes | disguises and diversions]].

*   **"Boomer Jim" Disguise**
    A complete disguise is adopted, transforming into "Boomer Jim" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This involves wearing an old man suit, a hat, and glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The objective is to blend in with "normal people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a> inside the store.
    > "I need to put on a disguise... I look so old. Now we put the hat on, throw on a pair of glasses, and boom. I'm Boomer Jim." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>

*   **Bag Disguise**
    The money-filled backpack is hidden inside a larger, innocuous bag to avoid detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

*   **Tire Puncture Diversion**
    While the disguised individual enters Walmart, an accomplice is tasked with puncturing the tires of the pursuers' car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This act serves to strand them and buy significant time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
    > "While they're inside searching for me, you need to pop all the tires on their car to strand them." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>

## Air Travel and Storage Locker Escape

The [[unconventional_chase_scenarios_and_stunts | chase scenarios]] escalate with air travel and an elaborate storage unit escape.

*   **Private Jet Getaway**
    A private jet is pre-arranged to take off precisely as the pursuers arrive at the airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, showcasing a dramatic escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. The jet's destination is Washington D.C. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, creating a significant time lead.

*   **Storage Locker and Box Shipment**
    At a U-Store facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>, a storage locker is purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. A decoy message is left, "Time is running out. I was in the box." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. The escapees then hide in boxes and are "shipped alive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a> via a box truck, which serves as the next getaway vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
    > "Me and you are gonna hide in these boxes. We're literally about to get shipped alive." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>

## Island Excursion and Stadium Concealment

The pursuit continues with further creative [[creative_escape_environments | environments]] and [[strategies_and_hiding_spots_in_large_areas | hiding spots]].

*   **Island Getaway via Boat**
    Following the box truck, the escapees board a boat to reach a private island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. The pursuers are given slow "swan boats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a> to follow, creating a significant delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

*   **NFL Stadium Hiding Strategy**
    The final major location is a rented NFL football stadium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
    *   **Video Loop Diversion**: A pre-recorded video of the escapee taunting the pursuers is played on a loop on the stadium screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
    *   **Mannequin Decoys**: The stadium is filled with mannequins to confuse the pursuers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
    *   **Mannequin Disguise**: The escapee later steals a mannequin's clothes to blend in as a static figure among the decoys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>, hoping to avoid detection for the remaining time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
    > "I'm gonna go fake pose like a mannequin and pray they don't find me for the next hour and a half." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>

This series of elaborate getaways and disguises demonstrates a dynamic and unpredictable approach to evading capture within the challenge.

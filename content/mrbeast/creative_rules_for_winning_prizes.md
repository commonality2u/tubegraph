Various challenges have been devised where contestants aim to win prizes by fitting items into designated spaces or adhering to specific conditions. These challenges often involve creative interpretations of boundaries or the strategic stacking of objects.

## "Fit in the Circle" Challenges

A common format involves a hidden circle on the ground, with the challenge being to fit chosen items within its boundaries. The rules governing the circle can change for different contestants, adding an element of surprise and difficulty.

### Initial "Fit in the Circle" with Chandler
Chandler is presented with a red tape circle, and the rule is that anything he can fit inside it will be paid for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He starts by attempting to fit two PlayStations and a T-Rex toy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The crucial rule is that no item can touch the red tape marking the circle's boundary; if it does, everything must be put back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Chandler successfully stacks his chosen items, including a TV and a waffle maker, to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### "Fit in the Square" with Tyler
Tyler is given a similar challenge, initially believing he has a circle, but it is revealed to be a square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. He selects expensive items like a $280 anime statue, a large prop from a previous video, and a shield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The rule is that items can go *over* the red tape as long as they don't touch the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, and if anything falls, Tyler loses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Despite the difficulty, Tyler manages to fit all items, winning the haul estimated at $10,000, plus an additional $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Grocery Store Challenge for a Soup Kitchen
This challenge is held at a grocery store for representatives of a soup kitchen, who are told that anything they can fit into a "mysterious circle" will be paid for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The circle is initially hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. As they fill numerous carts with food, the "circle" is magically revealed to extend to fit everything, including whole pallets of water bottles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Additionally, they receive a $20,000 check for the soup kitchen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This represents a [[winning_and_allocation_of_prize_money_in_challenges | winning and allocation of prize money]] that extends beyond just the items.

### Furniture Store Challenge
A family affected by floods is offered new furniture under the "fit in the circle" rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. They select a bed, lamps, dining room items, and a sofa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. The rule for furniture is lenient; as long as the wheels touching the ground are inside the circle, the item counts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. The total cost of the furniture is nearly $30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

### Store Challenge for the Wilkerson Family
The Wilkerson family, who are in need, participate in a similar challenge at a store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. The person drawing the circle is instructed to make it as big as possible, creating a pentagon-shaped boundary to maximize their winnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. They fill 13 carts with items, including a leg massager, toothbrushes, Ninja blenders, and Fortnite merchandise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. The generous circle allows them to keep everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. Additionally, they receive a $10,000 check for hospital bills and a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

### Helping People with Learning Disabilities
A representative from an organization working with people with learning disabilities is given a circle. The rule is that nothing can touch the red tape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. She selects numerous tablets, noting their importance for individuals who cannot speak for themselves, as well as electric toothbrushes and Fitbits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. All items successfully fit within the circle, and the organization wins all the selected products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

### Middle School Baseball Coach Challenge
A middle school baseball coach participates in a challenge at a sporting goods store. The rule is that whatever he buys that fits in the circle will be paid for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. He chooses a catcher's mitt, cleats for his players, a helmet, and two bats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. He successfully fits all items and wins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. His prize is then revealed to his baseball team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

### Tech and Toys Challenge
A female contestant selects an Xbox, a hoverboard, and a $400 hair dryer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. The rule is that once the circle is revealed, she cannot grab anything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. All her chosen items successfully fit within the circle, and she wins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

### Baby Store Challenge for Chris's Baby
Chris, who is about to become a father, goes to a baby store. The rule is that anything he can fit in the circle under the tarp will be bought for his baby, Tucker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. He chooses a car seat and a lot of baby clothes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. Despite a moment of panic as items almost touch the boundary, everything fits, and he wins the baby items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

## Unique Contest Formats

Beyond the "fit in the circle" theme, other creative rules are employed to award prizes. These [[unique_contest_formats | unique contest formats]] challenge participants in different ways.

### "Stand in This Circle for $100"
A large red circle is placed on the ground with a sign offering $100 to anyone who stands in it for 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Many people eventually gather in the circle, earning $100 each for their participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. This highlights [[creative_ways_to_win_money_or_prizes | creative ways to win money or prizes]] with minimal effort.

### "Fit on the Wallet" with Chandler
Chandler is given a challenge to fit chosen items onto a very small wallet, which is revealed to be the actual "circle" for the contest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. He picks expensive items like $500 pink shoes, $570 green shoes, a $250 teddy bear, a $250 wire cutter, a $400 statue, a $30 brick, an $1,800 Louis Vuitton bag, and a $1,000 wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. His strategy is to stuff almost everything into the $2,000 bag and place it on top of the wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. However, the stack is unstable and collapses, causing him to lose everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. It is then revealed that the "pizza" shape of the circle was drawn by Chris, leading to Chandler's failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

### Money Stacking Challenge
Contestants are given a square and challenged to stack as much money as they can within its boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. The rule is that if the stack falls, they lose everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>. One contestant manages to stack $5,000, successfully winning the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

From: [[mrbeast]] <br/> 

A unique social experiment involved giving random individuals an unlimited credit card, challenging them to make significant purchases without knowing the card's true limit. Participants were informed there was a hidden limit, and if they exceeded it, they would lose everything they selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This created scenarios of [[budgeting_and_spending_limits_in_shopping_scenarios | budgeting and spending limits in shopping scenarios]] and risk-taking, often leading to moments of shock and joy when the transactions were approved.

## Shopping Spree at Target
In a Target store, known for previously asking the video crew to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, a couple was given the unlimited credit card. They initially estimated the limit to be around $200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Despite being encouraged to spend more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, they remained conservative, eventually purchasing items including iPads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Their total came to $5,915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Upon the card's approval, they expressed immense disbelief and joy, describing it as the "craziest thing that's ever happened" to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The revelation that the card had no limit at all added to their astonishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Lego Store Challenge
Another group was given the card at a Lego store with the same mysterious limit rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. They decided to "go big" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, selecting expensive items like a Statue of Liberty Lego set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a> and a Millennium Falcon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The total for their purchases reached $3,494.90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The approval of the card, despite their expectation of it being declined, led to enthusiastic celebrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Designer Store Experiment
At a designer store where items cost thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, a participant was given the card and the entire store was symbolically shut down for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. They estimated the limit to be around $5,000 or possibly $9,999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. They chose high-value items such as a $500 wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, an $850 hoodie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, $330 shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, and $1,100 shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Nearing their perceived limit, they removed an item to stay under $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The total was $5,013.94 before adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The card's approval caused the participant to be speechless, and his mother was visibly more excited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. He was later informed that the card had no limit at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## First Date with a Twist
A couple on their first date was presented with the credit card in an art gallery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. The woman speculated the limit could be $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, but the man aimed to keep purchases below $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. They considered expensive art pieces, including one priced at $18,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a> and another at $26,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. They eventually chose two pieces totaling $15,786.87 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. The successful transaction marked the pieces as theirs, astonishing the couple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. The woman described the date as "unexpected" and loved it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

## A Gift for a Mother
A man on the street was offered the credit card for a purchase at a jewelry store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. He revealed his mother had Stage 4 cancer and wished to buy her a necklace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. He chose a necklace for $6,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a> and considered adding a pinky ring for himself. The jeweler offered a deal: the necklace, a ring for his mother, and another pinky ring for $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. The final purchase amount was set at $8,999.99 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. The card's approval brought joy to the man, who expressed gratitude for being able to give something to his mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

## Surprise Car Purchase
A familiar face, Andre, who had occasionally helped with videos, was unexpectedly given the credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. He initially estimated the limit to be $10,000 or $11,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Andre then found a Toyota car for $15,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. The twist came when it was revealed that car dealerships typically do not accept credit cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, and the card's *true* limit was indeed unlimited, allowing the team to directly purchase the car for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Andre was "completely flabbergasted" by the surprise gift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, marking a significant [[impact_of_surprise_gifts_on_recipients_lives | impact of surprise gifts on recipients' lives]].

## Best Buy Haul
A woman at Best Buy was given the card and told she could buy anything as long as she didn't exceed the secret limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. She pondered a large TV ($800) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a> and a MacBook Pro for her boyfriend, which brought her total over $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. The group was briefly kicked out of the store, requiring a more discreet approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. She added more items like iPads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>, bringing her total to $4,583 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. Her excitement was palpable upon approval, only to be surprised again by the revelation of the unlimited limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

## Generous Tip for a Waiter
During a meal, the group engaged their waiter in the credit card game for the tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. The waiter could write any tip amount, but if it exceeded the card's limit, the meal would be paid with a different card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. He found the idea of a $5,000 tip absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>, but eventually wrote a tip of $1,575, making the total $1,999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. The card was approved, much to his delight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

## More Electronics at Best Buy
Another individual was given the card at Best Buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. They started with smaller items like a Queen speaker for $18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a> and then two speakers for $150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. The participant guessed the limit was $4,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a> and proceeded to add a Nintendo Switch with three games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a> and even considered two iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Their total reached $3,971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. The card's approval left them nervous but ecstatic, confirming all the items were theirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

## Comics and Collectibles Store Spree
In a comic and collectibles store, a man was given the card and told the same rules about the secret limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. He initially thought the limit might only be $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. He was encouraged to "fill it up" with items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. He picked out a "My Hero Academia" item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>, a Boba Fett shirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>, a "Star Wars" arcade machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>, and considered expensive statues like a $3,000 Joker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>, ultimately choosing a Captain America statue and a Darth Vader mini-fridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. He also added an entire Mandalorian Pop! Funko set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. The total came to $6,595 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. The card's approval caused the nervous participant to exclaim in relief and happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

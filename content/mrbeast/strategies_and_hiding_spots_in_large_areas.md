An abandoned hospital complex, featuring over 100 rooms and six surrounding buildings, served as the challenging arena for a high-stakes game of hide-and-seek, with a grand prize of $100,000 [00:00:00]. Participants had to employ various [[hide_and_seek_strategies | hiding strategies]] and [[escape_tactics_and_evasion_techniques | evasion techniques]] within this expansive environment to avoid being tagged by the hunters.

## Initial Hiding and Evasion

Upon the countdown, players dispersed rapidly, attempting to find immediate cover or distance themselves from the hunters [00:00:18]. The vastness of the location, with "so many rooms," was immediately noted as a challenge and an opportunity for hiders [00:00:26].

## Hiding Spot Strategies

Players utilized a diverse range of locations to conceal themselves:

*   **Roofs:** Nolan was seen climbing a ladder to the roof early on, believing it would work as a hiding spot [00:00:31]. Rick was also spotted on a rooftop later in the game [00:07:19]. Chandler also utilized the roof as a hiding spot [00:04:06].
*   **Under Objects:** One player hid under a trailer [00:01:55]. Karl strategically hid "under the money," a large pile of cash, confident they wouldn't be found [00:05:49].
*   **Vehicles:** Karl and Chandler attempted to hide inside Jimmy's car, disguised as "all the way up" [00:08:44].
*   **Building Interiors:**
    *   The "so many rooms" of the hospital offered numerous potential hiding spots [00:00:26].
    *   Specific areas like under stairs were identified by hunters as likely hiding places [00:12:12].
    *   The cafeteria, described as "ginormous," was also used for hiding [00:08:09, 00:12:57].
    *   Jordan notably locked herself in the men's bathroom as a desperate attempt to evade capture [00:15:11].

## Hunter Strategies and Challenges

The hunters, initially led by Jimmy, then joined by Chris, faced the immense challenge of locating players in such a large area [00:01:41]. Their [[strategies_to_locate_someone_in_a_large_area | strategies]] included:

*   **Teamwork:** Jimmy and Chris collaborated, often communicating through walkie-talkies to coordinate their search and corner players [00:01:41, 00:04:08]. Later, Karl filled in for Chris when he was injured [00:11:30].
*   **Observation:** Hunters relied on visual cues, such as spotting someone laying down [00:04:07], or noticing subtle movements like a door moving [00:14:30].
*   **Luring:** A briefcase containing $10,000 was placed in the middle of the hospital as a trap, designed to draw out hiders [00:11:10].
*   **Bribing:** Sapnap offered information on Karl's location in exchange for his channel being tweeted out [00:06:52].
*   **Area Constriction:** Towards the end of the game, the search area was restricted to just the hospital building to narrow down the remaining hiders [00:11:33].
*   **Deception:** Hunters sometimes used fake calls or statements to try and elicit responses from hidden players, such as pretending to see them [00:14:38].
*   **Physical Pursuit:** Direct chasing was a common tactic, often leading to exhaustion for both hunters and hiders [00:01:04, 00:05:11, 00:08:28].

## Evasion and Escape Tactics

Players used various methods to avoid capture and extend their time in the game, demonstrating different [[escape_tactics_and_evasion_techniques | evasion techniques]]:

*   **Running/Booking It:** Many players immediately ran to create distance from the hunters [00:00:43].
*   **Cutting Through Areas:** Some attempted to cut through buildings or areas to escape pursuit [00:00:46].
*   **Jumping:** Rick attempted to escape by jumping off a roof [00:07:45]. Nolan similarly considered jumping from a height to evade capture [00:05:34].
*   **Strategic Disguises:** While limited, an attempt was made to hide inside a car by disguising themselves, hoping not to be found [00:08:44].

## Challenges and Outcomes

The extensive environment presented numerous [[challenges_and_hiding_strategies | challenges]]:

*   **Fatigue:** Both hunters and hiders experienced significant exhaustion due to the constant running and searching [00:01:04, 00:05:11, 00:08:51].
*   **Injuries:** Chris sustained a leg injury [00:11:32], and Jimmy struggled with oxygen during a chase [00:05:11].
*   **Getting Stuck:** Chris found himself stuck on a roof at one point, requiring assistance from Jimmy with a ladder [00:06:29, 00:06:44].
*   **Locked Doors:** Hunters occasionally encountered locked doors, hindering their pursuit [00:03:21, 00:03:37].
*   **Misdirection:** Players like Sapnap successfully managed to "ditch Chris in the forest" [00:10:15].

Ultimately, the most effective [[creative_hiding_strategies_and_outcomes | hiding strategies]] involved dynamic movement or clever, unexpected static positions that were difficult to discover. Hiding in confined spaces, while seemingly secure, often proved risky as the search area constricted [00:13:13]. The final winner, Sapnap, secured the $100,000 prize after being the last person to evade capture [00:15:47, 00:16:12].

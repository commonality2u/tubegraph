## Bathtub of Snakes

One challenge involved a bathtub filled with snakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Participants were offered $10,000 if they sat in the tub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. A professional snake handler, Brian, was present to assist with the animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. One participant, Chris, managed to sit in the tub, despite a snake constricting slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. He was then informed there were 20 more snakes to add <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Chris completed the challenge, winning $10,000 for his mom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Money Box with Cockroaches

Another challenge featured a box containing $15,000 covered with giant cockroaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. A sound guy named Jeff was given 60 seconds to grab as much money as he could from the box, with the condition that he could keep whatever he collected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Jeff successfully grabbed $9,340, despite the presence of the cockroaches and a request to pet one for an extra second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Tarantula Crawl

Tareq was challenged to let a tarantula crawl on him for 30 seconds, with $10,000 offered to his mom as the reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. His mom was present to cheer him on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Tareq was told that if the tarantula bit him, the money would be doubled, though it was assured the tarantula would not bite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Tareq completed the 30-second [[Psychological and physical challenges | psychological challenge]], securing $10,000 for his mom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Rat-Filled Safe Room

In a challenge involving a safe, Karl had to guess a code while locked in a room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. The twist was that every 10 seconds, a rat was introduced into the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. The safe code was related to Karl's birthday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Despite the increasing number of rats, Karl eventually figured out the code, which was the day before his birthday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. The safe contained $20,000 and Chandler's stolen teddy bear, which was awarded to another contestant, Mary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Animal Handler Shoutout

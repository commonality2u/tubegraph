The challenge to win a private island involved a series of eliminations throughout various competitive tasks, culminating in a final vote by previously eliminated contestants to determine the ultimate winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The game began with ten participants, with one person being eliminated after each challenge until a single winner remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Initial Eliminations

### First Challenge: Coconut Scramble
The first challenge was a frantic scramble to place a coconut into a designated hole. The last person to successfully do so was eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   **Eliminated:** Jed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>
*   **Reason:** Jed failed to secure a coconut in time, citing that Tyler grabbed the one he was aiming for and another one he spotted wasn't there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### Second Challenge: Direct Vote
Following the first physical challenge, the contestants were tasked with voting one person off the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Each participant wrote a name on a clipboard, and the person with the most votes was eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Once votes were written, they could not be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This marked an early instance of [[contestants_decision_making | decision-making]] affecting the competition directly.
*   **Eliminated:** Darren <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>
*   **Reason:** Darren received the most votes from the other contestants. Some participants, notably the host, implied that Karl was largely responsible for Darren's elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Third Challenge: Hide and Seek
Eight remaining contestants played a game of hide and seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The rule was simple: the first person found would be eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Eliminated:** Tyler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
*   **Reason:** The host found Tyler hiding in some bushes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Tyler lamented losing a "million dollars" (the approximate value of the island) due to hide and seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

### Fourth Challenge: Swimming Race
A highly physical swimming challenge was next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Contestants had to turn around from the beach and swim to a boat, with the last person to touch the boat being eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Eliminated:** Jess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>
*   **Reason:** Jess came in last place, acknowledging her lack of speed in swimming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### Fifth Challenge: Golden Coconut Elimination
This challenge involved a blindfolded search for a hidden treasure chest containing a golden coconut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. The first person to find it earned the power to choose who would be eliminated next by throwing the coconut at them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Winner:** Karl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>
*   **Eliminated:** Tyler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>
*   **Reason:** Karl chose to eliminate Tyler, citing it was a choice between Tyler and one other person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. This highlights [[contestant_strategies_and_dynamics | the dynamics]] of who gets to make [[decision_making_and_strategy_among_contestants | strategic decisions]].

## Bringing a Contestant Back

After the fifth elimination, with only four contestants remaining, a unique twist was introduced: the remaining participants had to collaboratively choose one of the previously eliminated contestants to bring back to the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **Brought Back:** Jess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>
*   **Reason:** Jess was chosen by three of the four remaining contestants. One contestant stated they picked Jess because she was one of the only eliminated individuals who didn't express a desire to vote him out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. This demonstrates [[contestant_competition_strategies | strategic alliances]] and [[contestant_strategies_and_dynamics | dynamics]].

## Further Eliminations

### Sixth Challenge: Subscription Check
With five people on the island, the next challenge involved checking if contestants were subscribed to specific YouTube channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Failure to be subscribed meant elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This unusual challenge tested their loyalty to the host's online presence.
*   **Eliminated:** Ethan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a> (referred to as Tags)
*   **Reason:** Ethan was not subscribed to the "PewDiePie" YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Nolan was initially not subscribed to MrBeast Gaming, but was saved when others also weren't subscribed to Pewdiepie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

### Seventh Challenge: Team Coconut Toss
The remaining four contestants formed two teams of two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. They had to toss a golden coconut back and forth, progressively stepping further apart. The first team to drop their coconut was eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
*   **Teams:** Karl & Chandler, Nolan & Jess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>
*   **Eliminated:** Nolan and Jess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>
*   **Reason:** Nolan dropped the coconut during a toss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

### Eighth Challenge: Coconut Bowling
The three remaining contestants faced a coconut bowling challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Each person had one attempt, and the person who knocked down the least number of pins was eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
*   **Eliminated:** Nolan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>
*   **Reason:** Nolan knocked down zero pins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>, while Chandler achieved a perfect strike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>, and Karl managed to hit four pins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

## The Final Decision

With only two contestants left, Karl and Chandler, all previously eliminated contestants were brought back to the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. They were then tasked with deciding who would win the island by voting one of the two finalists off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. Each finalist was given a minute to "plead their case" to the jury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. This final voting stage created significant [[contestant_strategies_and_dynamics | interpersonal drama]] and highlighted [[contestants_decision_making | decision-making]] among past competitors.

### Final Vote and Tie-breaker
The jury cast their votes, resulting in a tie between Karl and Chandler, each receiving four votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. As there was no backup plan for a tie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>, all eight votes were placed back into a box, and Jed, the first person eliminated, was chosen to draw one vote to determine the winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.
*   **Winner:** Chandler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>
*   **Reason:** Jed drew a vote for Chandler, making him the winner of the $700,000 island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.
*   **Second Place:** Karl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>
*   **Impact:** Karl was noted to have officially lost over a million dollars in challenges across various competitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>.

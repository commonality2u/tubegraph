An ambitious experiment involved preparing 100 million Orbeez for a massive backyard growth project, intending to fill an entire backyard and pool with expanded Orbeez <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:47">[01:31:47]</a>.

## Initial Setup and Quantity
The project started with demonstrating various quantities of Orbeez, from 50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> to 1 million, which represented only 1% of the total Orbeez available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The team had 100 boxes, each containing 1 million Orbeez, totaling 100 million Orbeez for the experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Orbeez are known to grow approximately 30 times larger when exposed to water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## The Plan for Expansion
The primary strategy involved laying out all 100 million Orbeez on tarps in a backyard and waiting for rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The goal was for the backyard to be completely covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>, with the expectation that the rain would cause all 100 million Orbeez to grow to their full size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>, potentially overflowing the fence due to their sheer volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## Observing Initial Growth
On the second day of the experiment, after some Orbeez had been placed in the pool, they had already grown "ginormous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. Approximately a million Orbeez were initially put into the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

## Laying Out the Remaining Orbeez
With 97 million Orbeez still to be expanded, the team proceeded to lay them out on tarps across the backyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. The plan relied on an expected 10 hours of rain overnight to facilitate their growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. By the following day, the entire backyard was covered in un-grown Orbeez <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. The team continued to dump out the remaining 20 million Orbeez, observing how much space they occupied even before growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Biodegradability and Environmental Impact of Orbeez
> The Orbeez used in the experiment were confirmed to be [[biodegradability_and_environmental_impact_of_orbeez | biodegradable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>. The team stated that they would attempt to pick up all the Orbeez, and any remaining ones would not be harmful to wildlife like squirrels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a>.

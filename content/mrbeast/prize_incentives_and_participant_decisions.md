Throughout a multi-level laser maze competition, various [[moneybased_competitions_and_incentives | monetary incentives]] were offered to contestants, influencing their strategies and decision-making at critical junctures. The ultimate goal for the participants was to win a substantial cash prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Primary Incentive: $250,000 Grand Prize

The main incentive for the ten initial contestants was a grand prize of $250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This significant amount of money was described as being "on the line" throughout the challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The prize money remained the driving force for contestants, pushing them to endure difficult and lengthy challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. The anticipation of potentially winning was described as "the biggest three and a half seconds of your life" in one level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## Secondary Incentives and Offers

Beyond the grand prize, two additional [[participant_incentives_and_offers | incentives]] were introduced:

### Prime Hydration Offer
In Level 7, contestants were offered an additional $10,000 if they completed the course while holding a bottle of Prime Hydration drink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. This offer was separate from the main competition, meaning a contestant could still win the $10,000 even if they were eliminated from the primary challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

### Tesla Offer
Before Level 7, the remaining three contestants were presented with a direct choice: eliminate themselves from the competition and win a Tesla, or continue competing for the $250,000 grand prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. The Tesla was valued at approximately $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. This offer provided a guaranteed, significant prize against the risk of potentially winning nothing but gaining the chance at the quarter-million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

## Influence on Participant Decisions

The various [[incentives_and_motivations_in_challenges | incentives]] significantly impacted the [[contestants_decision_making | contestants' decision-making]] and behavior throughout the competition.

### Endurance and Determination
The pursuit of the $250,000 grand prize instilled a high level of determination in the contestants.
*   In the "laser prison" challenge (Level 5), contestants had to wait for up to 10 hours for the lasers to briefly turn off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Despite fatigue and hunger over seven hours, all remaining contestants successfully completed the challenge due to their determination to reach the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

> "I do not spend all this time in here to not touch that box." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>
> "We're just that determined." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>

### Strategic Choices
The value of the prize money led contestants to make strategic decisions in the challenges.
*   In Level 7, a contestant chose to risk "breaking the game" and the set design by attempting to jump over laser walls rather than navigating the tight laser maze, believing it increased their chances of survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. This risky maneuver, described as "insane," proved successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.
*   In the final round, with $250,000 at stake, one contestant decided to "send it" and run through the course quickly, rather than waiting for their opponent to make a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>.

### Temptation vs. Grand Prize
The decision regarding the Tesla offer highlighted a key aspect of [[incentives_and_temptation_during_challenges | participant incentives]].
*   All three remaining contestants declined the guaranteed Tesla (worth $40,000) to continue pursuing the $250,000 grand prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.
*   One contestant acknowledged the Tesla was a car they wanted, but prioritized the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.
*   The overwhelming desire to win the larger sum led them to reject a substantial immediate reward, demonstrating the strong pull of the ultimate [[prize_distribution_and_winners_intentions | prize]].

> "You have a guaranteed 40 grand or a 33% chance of 250." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>
> "I'm going to go with... The money." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>
> "You never get this chance." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>

### Reactions to Outcomes
The impact of [[the_impact_of_prize_money_on_participants_lives | prize money]] was also evident in the emotional reactions of contestants.
*   Upon elimination from the main prize, one contestant was visibly upset, stating "It hurts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. However, receiving the $10,000 Prime bonus was noted to "make it taste a little bit better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.
*   The second-place contestant, who was eliminated in the final round, also received a $10,000 prize, which he gratefully accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>. While not the grand prize, this consolation prize offered some recognition for his efforts, illustrating an aspect of [[prize_distribution_and_surprise_outcomes | prize distribution]].

Ultimately, the structure of the competition, with its high grand prize and strategic intermediate offers, created a dynamic environment where [[surprise_prizes_and_offers_for_participants | participant incentives]] played a crucial role in shaping outcomes.

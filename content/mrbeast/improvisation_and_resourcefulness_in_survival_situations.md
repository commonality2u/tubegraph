When faced with the challenges of a deserted island, participants demonstrated various forms of [[survival tactics | improvisation]] and [[resource management in survival situations | resourcefulness]].

## Initial Preparations and Unexpected Resources
Before arriving on the island, participants brought a mix of essential and unusual items. These included tents, chairs, Mountain Dew, a Barbie Easy-Bake oven, a container for human waste, and Fortnite Monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The inclusion of items like Monopoly suggests a form of [[survival strategies and making a routine | resourcefulness]] to combat potential boredom on a lonely island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. One participant also brought a "heavy object" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

A cash prize of $3,000 in $1 bills was buried on the island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. To hide it, Jimmy orchestrated a game of hide-and-seek to distract the others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. He strategically buried the money in the middle of the camp, believing no one would suspect it there, and even dug a decoy hole to mislead searchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Dustin eventually found the buried treasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Setting Up Camp and Environmental Challenges
Participants immediately began setting up their tents upon arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. One individual strategically placed their tent behind another's to block the wind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

As the tide rose, threatening to flood the camp, the participants quickly dug a moat around their tents to protect them from the incoming waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. This [[challenges and survival strategies | improvised]] barrier successfully withstood the high tide, preventing the village from going underwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This collective effort highlighted their ability to adapt to immediate environmental threats.

## Securing Food and Resources
After securing the camp, the next challenge was to make food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Chris, drawing on his Boy Scout (and Cub Scout) experience, demonstrated how to build a fire by explaining the need for fuel, flame, and oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Despite the sandy conditions, he successfully prepared a fire for cooking hot dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

A minor challenge arose when the group realized they had forgotten ketchup and mustard for the hot dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. One participant humorously stated that a hot dog without condiments was a reason to "put me in a coffin," illustrating the comedic yet relatable aspect of minor inconveniences in a survival-like scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

## Social Dynamics and Problem Solving
Social dynamics also played a role in how problems were addressed. Chandler, frustrated by the lack of food, threatened to walk around naked and tear up the camp if he didn't receive food within 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This extreme form of negotiation ultimately spurred others to cook.

To get help with building tents, one participant offered $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, while Dustin, having won the $3,000, offered to split the prize with others to incentivize them to help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

After a long day, the participants were exhausted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. The next morning, concern arose that the boats might not return, highlighting the ongoing reliance on external resources in this simulated [[survival in the wilderness | survival]] situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. The experience underscored the difficulties of [[challenges of extreme survival scenarios | extreme survival scenarios]] on a deserted island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

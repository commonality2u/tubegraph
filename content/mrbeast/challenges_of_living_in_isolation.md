Living in the wilderness for an extended period presents numerous [[challenges_of_surviving_on_a_deserted_island | challenges]], both physical and psychological. Participants in a survival challenge, Hase and Grizz, experienced many of these difficulties while attempting to earn money by surviving in the wilderness for as long as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Physical Challenges
The physical aspects of [[solitary_confinement_challenges | isolation]] and survival in the wilderness are immediately apparent:
*   **Extreme Cold**
    *   The first night in the wilderness was described as "cold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. For multiple consecutive days, the participants reported getting only two hours of sleep due to the cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
    *   One participant noted "cold toes, cold feet" and the lack of a sleeping bag as a persistent issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Lack of Proper Shelter and Sleep**
    *   Initially, the participants slept on the ground, which proved to be "pretty tired" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
    *   Lack of comfortable sleeping arrangements contributed to poor sleep quality, with only two hours of sleep daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
    *   Despite building more comfortable beds later in the challenge, the winter nights remained unforgiving without sleeping bags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   **Food and Water Scarcity**
    *   Participants began with only five days' worth of food and two containers of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. By day nine, they were "at the end of our supplies" and resorting to eating Greenbrier leaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
    *   The continuous struggle to find food led to extreme hunger, with one participant "on the last belt loop" due to weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
    *   Finding a clean water source was also a challenge, initially relying on boiling swamp water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Environmental Hazards and Discomfort**
    *   The constant threat of freezing rain and the risk of hypothermia were present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
    *   Warmer weather brought new problems like snakes and rats, which caused lack of sleep due to their presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

## Psychological Impact of Isolation
The [[psychological_impact_of_isolation | psychological impact of isolation]] and confinement weighed heavily on the participants, leading to emotional distress and changes in behavior:
*   **Missing Family and Loved Ones**
    *   Hase expressed the difficulty of explaining his absence to his two-year-old son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
    *   A visit from their wives highlighted the emotional toll, with one wife directly asking her husband to come home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. This interaction deeply affected Hase, changing his perspective on the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.
    *   Hase repeatedly thought about using the flare gun to end the challenge and return to his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.
    *   Ultimately, Hase stated that "the money doesn't matter to me anymore" and that his family needed him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.
*   **Irritability and Strain on Relationships**
    *   The lack of sleep contributed to irritability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
    *   Jokes between the friends "weren't hitting the same anymore," leading to an argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.
    *   Hase became "very angry" and temporarily separated from Grizz, paddling downriver to set up his own camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
    *   The strain intensified as Hase felt pressured by Grizz to stay longer for the money, stating, "He's kind of pushing me to stay longer and stay longer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. He also felt that Grizz was "manipulating me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.
    *   Hase expressed feeling "really let down and lied to" if Grizz were to pull the flare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.
*   **Mental Deterioration and Desperation**
    *   Hase admitted to spiraling, indicating a decline in his mental state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.
    *   In a moment of desperation, Hase "literally went into Grizzlies bag and stole the flare gun," despite having initially agreed to split their earnings and manage the flare gun separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Coping Mechanisms
Despite the immense [[the_psychological_and_emotional_challenges_of_isolation | psychological and emotional challenges of isolation]], the participants developed various coping mechanisms:
*   **Building a More Comfortable Environment**: They constructed a shelter, built beds from pine needles, and eventually a raised bed system using parachutes as mattresses to improve comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   **Resourcefulness**: They utilized parachute cords and tarps for rain covers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a> and built a fishing dock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a> and a boat out of sticks and tarps to improve their fishing capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.
*   **Interpersonal Support**: Despite their disagreements, Grizz constructed a table for Hase to cheer him up upon his return from a solo trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. The bond of friendship ultimately led Grizz to support Hase's decision to end the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.
*   **Focus on the Goal**: Initially, the prospect of earning "unlimited money" motivated them to endure the hardships, with a goal of making $3.6 million for a year's stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Hase specifically aimed for $1 million to provide for his family's college tuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

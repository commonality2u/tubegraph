The concept of a vector has multiple interpretations in mathematics, from arrows in space to lists of numbers or even functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. To unify these diverse "vectorish things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a> under a single theoretical framework, mathematicians developed the idea of [[abstract_vector_spaces|abstract vector spaces]] defined by a set of rules known as axioms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>.

## What are Vector Space Axioms?

Vector space axioms are a list of fundamental rules that define how vector addition and scalar multiplication must behave within a given set of objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>. In the modern theory of [[linear_algebra_foundations|linear algebra]], there are eight such axioms that any [[abstract_vector_spaces|vector space]] must satisfy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>. These rules ensure that the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication behave as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>.

The axioms are not seen as fundamental rules of nature but rather as an interface for mathematicians to discover general results and for others to apply those results to new kinds of [[abstract_vector_spaces|vector spaces]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>.

## Purpose and Generality

The primary purpose of defining [[abstract_vector_spaces|vector spaces]] through axioms is to achieve generality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>. Instead of proving theorems for arrows, then for lists of numbers, and then for functions, mathematicians can prove results based *only* on these axioms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>. This means that if any set of objects, along with their defined addition and scaling operations, satisfies these eight axioms, then all the theoretical constructs and tools of [[linear_algebra_foundations|linear algebra]] (like dot products, eigenvectors, and linear transformations) can be applied to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>.

For instance, if someone defines a new type of "vector space" (e.g., "pi creatures" with specific addition and scaling rules), they can verify these axioms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>. If the definitions satisfy the axioms, then all established results of [[linear_algebra_foundations|linear algebra]] automatically apply, even if the original mathematician never conceived of "pi creatures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>.

## Abstraction vs. Intuition

This axiomatic approach leads to a more abstract phrasing of results in [[linear_algebra_foundations|linear algebra]] textbooks and lectures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>. For example, a [[linear_transformation|linear transformation]] is formally defined by its additivity and scaling properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>:
*   **Additivity**: Applying a transformation to the sum of two vectors yields the same result as adding the transformed versions of each vector separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.
*   **Scaling**: Scaling a vector then applying a transformation yields the same result as applying the transformation first then scaling the result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

These abstract properties preserve the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. While visual intuition, like gridlines remaining parallel and evenly spaced in 2D space, helps in initial [[understanding_vectors_in_linear_algebra|understanding vectors in linear algebra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>, the abstract definition applies universally across all [[abstract_vector_spaces|vector spaces]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>.

## Vectors as Anything Satisfying the Axioms

Ultimately, the modern mathematical perspective on "what a vector is" is that its fundamental form doesn't matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a>. Whether it's arrows (as in [[vectors_in_two_and_three_dimensions|vectors in two and three dimensions]]), lists of numbers, or functions, any entity can be considered a vector as long as its defined operations of addition and scaling adhere to the established eight axioms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:00">[14:36:00]</a>. This approach abstracts multiple embodiments into a single, intangible notion of a [[abstract_vector_spaces|vector space]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>.

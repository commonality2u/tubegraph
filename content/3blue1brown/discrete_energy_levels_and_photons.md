Quantum mechanics emerged from observations that revealed certain restrictions on the energy levels of waves, how they behave when measured, and quantum entanglement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. A fundamental aspect of this field is the concept of discrete energy levels and the existence of photons.

## Foundations in Classical Wave Mechanics

To understand quantum mechanics deeply, it's essential to grasp the mathematical description of waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. Many ideas central to quantum mechanics, such as describing states as [[polarization_and_superposition_in_quantum_mechanics | superpositions]] with various amplitudes and phases, are first encountered in the context of classical waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

### Light as an Electromagnetic Wave
By the late 1800s, light was understood as waves in the electromagnetic field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. This understanding is largely based on [[maxwells_equations_and_electromagnetic_waves | Maxwell's equations]], which describe how electric and magnetic fields interact and cause changes in each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. A natural consequence of this interplay is the propagation of [[maxwells_equations_and_electromagnetic_waves | electromagnetic waves]], where electric and magnetic fields oscillate perpendicularly to each other and to the direction of propagation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. Light, radio waves, and other forms of [[electromagnetic_waves_and_charged_particles | electromagnetic radiation]] are examples of these propagating waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. The energy of a classical wave is proportional to the square of its amplitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>.

### Classical Superposition and Polarization
Classical waves can be described using concepts like amplitude and phase shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. If two distinct waves satisfy [[maxwells_equations_and_electromagnetic_waves | Maxwell's equations]] (in a vacuum), their sum also forms a valid wave, a principle known as [[polarization_and_superposition_in_quantum_mechanics | superposition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. For example, a horizontally polarized light wave (electric field oscillating horizontally) and a vertically polarized light wave (electric field oscillating vertically) can superpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>, creating a new wave that oscillates in a diagonal direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. If these components are out of phase, their sum might trace out an ellipse, leading to circularly polarized light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>.

The choice of directions to describe a wave (e.g., horizontal and vertical vs. diagonal and anti-diagonal) is called a "basis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>. This choice depends on the specific analysis, such as when light passes through a polarizing filter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.

## The Quantum Leap: Discrete Energy
Physicists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries observed that the energy of [[maxwells_equations_and_electromagnetic_waves | electromagnetic waves]] does not change continuously but rather comes in discrete amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>. This energy is always an integer multiple of Planck's constant (h) multiplied by the wave's frequency (f) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>. This means there is a minimal non-zero energy level for waves of a given frequency, `hf` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>. An [[maxwells_equations_and_electromagnetic_waves | electromagnetic wave]] with this minimal possible energy is called a **photon** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>.

While this concept of discrete energy is unusual for waves in free space, it is common in constrained classical waves, like harmonics in pipes or instrument strings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>. The "weirdness" in quantum mechanics is that [[maxwells_equations_and_electromagnetic_waves | electromagnetic waves]] exhibit this behavior even when unconstrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>.

## Photons and Probabilistic Interpretation
The mathematical framework used to describe classical [[maxwells_equations_and_electromagnetic_waves | electromagnetic waves]] carries over to describing a photon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>. A photon, for instance, with a 45-degree diagonal polarization, can be described as a [[polarization_and_superposition_in_quantum_mechanics | superposition]] of horizontal and vertical states, each with an amplitude and phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>. These components are often encoded using a single complex number, which naturally represents both amplitude and phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>.

However, the interpretation of this [[polarization_and_superposition_in_quantum_mechanics | superposition]] differs fundamentally from the classical case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>.

### Probability vs. Energy Contribution
Classically, if a diagonal wave has an amplitude of one, its horizontal and vertical components would each have an amplitude of the square root of one-half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>. The energy, being proportional to the square of the amplitude, would be split, with half the energy in the horizontal component and half in the vertical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>.

For a photon, this classical interpretation is incorrect because photons have discrete, indivisible energy chunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>. Instead, the squares of the amplitudes of the components in a photon's [[polarization_and_superposition_in_quantum_mechanics | superposition]] indicate the *probabilities* of finding the photon in a particular state upon measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:46:00">[18:46:00]</a>.

For example, if a diagonally polarized photon (amplitude 1) were to pass through a vertically oriented polarizing filter:
*   Classically, 50% of its energy (from the horizontal component) would be absorbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00">[14:37:00]</a>.
*   Quantically, since energy comes in indivisible photon packets, the photon either passes through with all its energy or is entirely absorbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>.
*   Experimentally, about half the time the photon passes through entirely, and about half the time it is absorbed entirely, seemingly at random <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a>. If it passes through, its polarization changes to align with the filter's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>.

### Measurement and State Collapse
This phenomenon is analogous to the concept of [[phase_space_and_population_dynamics | Schr√∂dinger's cat]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>. A photon exists in a [[polarization_and_superposition_in_quantum_mechanics | superposition]] of states (e.g., diagonal polarization being a superposition of horizontal and vertical). When a measurement is made, forcing it to interact with an observer in a way where each state would behave differently, the [[polarization_and_superposition_in_quantum_mechanics | superposition]] "collapses" to be entirely in one state or another (e.g., horizontal or vertical) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>.

A common experiment demonstrates this:
*   Two polarizing filters rotated 90 degrees relative to each other block out all light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:00">[15:46:00]</a>, as vertically polarized photons passing the first filter have a 0% chance of passing a horizontally oriented filter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>.
*   However, inserting a third filter at a 45-degree angle between them allows more light through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10:00">[16:10:00]</a>. This happens because 50% of the vertically polarized photons pass the diagonal filter, changing their state to purely diagonal polarization. Once in this diagonal state, they have a 50/50 chance of passing the final 90-degree filter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>. This results in 25% of the original photons passing through all three filters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:44:00">[16:44:00]</a>, an outcome unexplainable if the middle filter didn't force the photons to change their states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:00">[16:49:00]</a>. This experiment and the probabilities involved are further explored in a video about [[bells_inequalities_in_quantum_mechanics | Bell's inequalities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:55:00">[16:55:00]</a>.

## Broader Implications
The principle that the square of the amplitude of a component gives the probability of a measurement outcome extends beyond just photon polarization. It applies to quantum mechanical states generally, where states are described as [[polarization_and_superposition_in_quantum_mechanics | superpositions]] of multiple base states, with each component having an amplitude and phase (often as a complex number) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:52:00">[19:52:00]</a>.

Photons represent a case where something initially understood as a wave (due to [[maxwells_equations_and_electromagnetic_waves | Maxwell's equations]]) was later found to behave as individual particles or "quanta" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:32:00">[19:32:00]</a>. Conversely, particles like electrons, initially thought of as discrete packets, were discovered to be governed by similar [[relationship_between_classical_and_quantum_waves | wavy quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:42:00">[19:42:00]</a>. If the [[wave_nature_of_particles_and_de_broglies_hypothesis | wave nature of particles]] had been discovered first, quantum mechanics might have been named "harmonic mechanics," emphasizing the wave equations that govern particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">[20:25:00]</a>.

## Kepler's Initial Geometric Theory
Johannes Kepler sought to prove what he considered the most elegant theory in astronomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. His [[Keplers geometric theory of planetary orbits | geometric theory of planetary orbits]] proposed a cosmic model where six spheres were nested within and around the five Platonic solids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The arrangement involved:
*   A sphere inscribed in an octahedron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>
*   The smallest possible sphere around that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>
*   The smallest possible icosahedron around that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>
*   Another sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>
*   A dodecahedron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
*   One more sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
*   A tetrahedron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   One more sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   A cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   One final sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>

This yielded six spheres, and Kepler believed the ratios between their sizes would match the orbital ratios of the six known planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. He considered this a "natural or universal set of ratios" due to their connection to the Platonic solids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## From Geometric Theory to Observational Reality
To confirm his [[Keplers calculations of planetary orbits | theory]], Kepler obtained orbital data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Despite a "heroic" effort in his calculations, his theory consistently failed to fit the observational data, always being off by a few percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

> [!info] Significance
> Even though Kepler's initial premise was incorrect, this rigorous attempt to prove it, and the subsequent failure, directly led him to fundamentally understand how planets actually move around the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This pivotal work resulted in the [[development_of_keplers_laws_of_motion | development of his famous astronomical laws]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

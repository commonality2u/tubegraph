A series of videos is being developed as an [[overview_of_upcoming_series_on_linear_algebra | educational resource]] focused on [[linear_algebra_foundations | linear algebra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This subject is critical for almost any technical discipline but is often [[challenges_students_face_in_learning_linear_algebra | poorly understood by students]] initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Students frequently learn the numerical operations, such as matrix multiplication, determinants, cross products, and eigenvalues, without grasping the underlying geometric intuitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Goals of the Video Series

The primary goal of this series is to create a short, binge-watchable collection of videos that animate the [[importance_of_geometric_understanding_in_linear_algebra | intuitions]] behind [[linear_algebra_foundations | linear algebra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. The series aims to:
*   Present foundational concepts from the basics of [[understanding_vectors_in_linear_algebra | vectors]] up through the core topics of [[linear_algebra_foundations | linear algebra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   Lay down correct [[importance_of_geometric_understanding_in_linear_algebra | intuitions]] to make future learning of the subject more productive and fruitful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

It is important to note that the series is not intended to be a complete course capable of teaching the entire subject of [[linear_algebra_foundations | linear algebra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Instead, it serves as a conceptual foundation.

## Target Audience and Use Cases

This video series is designed to be a valuable resource for:
*   **Students** learning [[linear_algebra_foundations | linear algebra]] for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Educators** teaching courses that assume fluency with [[linear_algebra_foundations | linear algebra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. They can direct students needing a quick conceptual brush-up to this resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Content and Structure

The series will cover topics from the basics of [[understanding_vectors_in_linear_algebra | vectors]] to the core essence of [[linear_algebra_foundations | linear algebra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

### Release Schedule
*   Initially, one video will be released per day for five days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   Following the initial five days, new chapters will be released every one to two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### Learning Advice
Viewers are encouraged to:
*   **Pause and ponder** the content as needed, especially if the pacing feels too quick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   Actively engage with the material on their own time, as this self-reflection is crucial for genuine learning in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

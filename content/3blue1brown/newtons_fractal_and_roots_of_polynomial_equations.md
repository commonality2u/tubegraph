Holomorphic dynamics is a field of [[Mathematical concepts related to Newtons fractal | mathematics]] that studies systems involving the repeated application of complex functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This field is intimately tied to [[Newtons fractal and its relation to polynomials | Newton's fractal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Holomorphic functions are differentiable functions with complex number inputs and outputs, encompassing most ordinary functions like polynomials, exponentials, and trigonometric functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. When these functions are repeatedly applied, the resulting sequence of points can exhibit various behaviors: getting trapped in a cycle, approaching a limiting point (even infinity), or behaving chaotically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Visualizing these behaviors often reveals intricate [[Visualization and characteristics of fractal patterns | fractal patterns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Newton's Method and Fractal Generation

One notable example demonstrating these patterns is [[Understanding Newtons method and its applications | Newton's method]], an algorithm used to find the roots of a [[Permutation groups and polynomial equations | polynomial]] *p* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The method iteratively applies the expression `x - p(x) / p'(x)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. If an initial "seed" value is close to a polynomial root (where `p(x) = 0`), this process quickly converges to that root <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

When this process is extended to the complex plane, a visual representation can be created:
1.  Various complex seed values are tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
2.  Each seed value is assigned a color based on which complex root it converges to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
3.  The resulting image reveals intricate pictures with rough [[fractal geometry | fractal]] boundaries between the colored regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

For a specific polynomial like `z³ - 1`, the iterated expression can be rewritten as one polynomial divided by another, which mathematicians call a rational function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. The study of iterating rational functions was pioneered by Pierre Fatou and Gaston Julia after World War I, forming a rich theory without the aid of computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Fixed Points and Stability

To understand the full dynamics of these systems, mathematicians analyze fixed points and their stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
*   A **fixed point** is a value `z` where `f(z) = z` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. By design, Newton's method functions have fixed points at the roots of the relevant polynomial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   A fixed point is **attracting** if nearby points converge towards it, and **repelling** if they are pushed away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. This stability can be computed using the derivative of the function at the fixed point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
    *   If the absolute value of the derivative is less than 1, the fixed point is attracting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
    *   If the absolute value is greater than 1, it's repelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

For Newton's map, the derivative at a fixed point (a root of the polynomial *p*) is equal to 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. These are called "super-attracting" fixed points because a neighborhood around them shrinks significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. This behavior is intentional, designed to quickly draw iterations towards a root <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

## Attracting Cycles and the Mandelbrot Set

Beyond fixed points, the dynamics can involve **cycles**, where `f(f(z)) = z` (for a 2-cycle) or `f^n(z) = z` (for an n-cycle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Finding these cycles often boils down to solving complex [[Permutation groups and polynomial equations | polynomial]] equations, with the number of periodic points growing exponentially with the cycle period *n* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

A critical question for numerical methods is whether Newton's map can have an **attracting cycle**, as this would mean an initial guess could get trapped and never find a root <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. For certain polynomials, like `z³ - 2z + 2`, attracting cycles do exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. For example, a cluster of points starting near zero can get trapped in a 2-cycle between zero and one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.

A surprising fact for cubic polynomials is that if an attracting cycle exists, the process initiated at the "center of mass" (average of the three roots) will fall into that cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. This stems from a theorem by Fatou, which states that if a rational map has an attracting cycle, at least one value where the derivative of the iterated function equals zero must fall into that cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.

This "magical fact" allows for a visualization of which cubic polynomials have attracting cycles. By fixing two roots (e.g., at -1 and 1) and moving a third root (`lambda`) around the complex plane, a "parameter space" can be generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>. Each pixel in this space corresponds to a unique polynomial and is colored black if its center-of-mass point (and thus an attracting cycle) is found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. When zoomed in, this parameter space reveals a black region that looks exactly like the [[Visualization and characteristics of fractal patterns | Mandelbrot set]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. This suggests that the [[Visualization and characteristics of fractal patterns | Mandelbrot set]] shape is not specific to the `z² + c` example but relates to a more general and universal property of parameter spaces in iterative processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.

## Why Fractals Appear: Chaos and Julia Sets

The fractal nature of these diagrams is linked to the concept of chaos. For any rational map, if regions are colored based on their limiting behavior (e.g., convergence to a root or infinity), then tiny circles drawn around the boundaries of these regions will contain points exhibiting *all* available limiting behaviors, never just some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>. If there are three or more distinct behaviors, this property implies that the boundaries cannot be smooth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>. This is why these boundaries appear rough, regardless of how much one zooms in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>.

Key terminology for understanding this:
*   **Fatou set**: Comprises points that eventually fall into some stable, predictable pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. For maps like Newton's, this includes almost all points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. Small discs in the Fatou set tend to shrink upon iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.
*   **Julia set**: Comprises all other points, forming the rough boundaries between colored regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. It includes repelling cycles and fixed points, and typically, points in the Julia set behave chaotically, with no clear pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. Small discs around points in the Julia set tend to expand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.

This expansion is extreme: a small disk around a point on the Julia set will eventually expand to cover every single point on the complex plane, with at most two exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>. This is referred to as the "stuff-goes-everywhere principle" of Julia sets and is a corollary to Montel's theorem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. This principle implies that if a map has multiple attractive behaviors, the Julia set must be complicated, as any small region on its boundary must eventually touch all possible attractive regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>.

The connection between chaos and [[fractal dimension and its implications | fractals]] is fundamental: the quantification of how chaotic some points are provides a logical explanation for the rough [[fractal geometry | fractal]] shape of these boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>.

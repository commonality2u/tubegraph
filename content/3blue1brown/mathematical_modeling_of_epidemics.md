The phrase "[[understanding_exponential_growth | exponential growth]]" is familiar to most people, yet human intuition often struggles to fully grasp its implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. What might start as small numbers can suddenly become large, even if the overall trend consistently follows an exponential pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

Using the recorded cases of COVID-19 (coronavirus) as an example, this phenomenon can be explored to understand what [[exponential_growth_and_decay | exponential growth]] truly is, where it originates, what it implies, and how to anticipate its end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Understanding Exponential Growth in Epidemics

[[understanding_exponential_growth | Exponential growth]] signifies that the quantity increases by multiplying by a constant factor from one period to the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. In the context of epidemics, such as viral outbreaks, the number of cases on any given day tends to be a multiple of the previous day's cases, for example, 1.15 to 1.25 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

Viruses serve as a classic illustration of this growth pattern because new cases are generated by existing cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. If 'n' represents the number of cases on a given day, 'e' is the average number of people each infected individual is exposed to daily, and 'p' is the probability of an exposure leading to a new infection, then the number of new cases can be modeled as:
`New Cases = e × p × n` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>

The critical element here is that 'n' (the current number of cases) is a direct factor in its own rate of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. As 'n' increases, the rate of growth itself accelerates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This means that each day's total cases are simply the previous day's total multiplied by a constant greater than one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Visualizing Growth

To better understand this, placing the y-axis of a graph on a logarithmic scale can be helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. On this scale, each fixed distance step represents multiplication by a certain factor (e.g., a power of 10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. When plotted this way, [[understanding_exponential_growth | exponential growth]] appears as a straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

Analysis of data, such as the COVID-19 cases, shows that it took approximately 20 days to increase from 100 to 1,000 cases, and 13 days to jump from 1,000 to 10,000 cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. A linear regression on this logarithmic scale reveals that the number of cases tended to multiply by 10 every 16 days on average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The fit of this exponential model to the data is "really freaking close" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

This pattern leads to counterintuitive conclusions:
> When you see one country with, say, 6000 cases and another with 60, it's easy to think that the second is doing 100 times better, and hence fine. But if you're actually in a situation where numbers multiply by 10 every 16 days, another way to view the same fact is that the second country is about a month behind the first. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>

Such trends, if extrapolated, can be alarming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. For instance, based on a March 6th recording, a continued trend would suggest hitting a million cases in 30 days, 10 million in 47 days, 100 million in 64 days, and 1 billion in 81 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## The Limits of Exponential Growth: The Logistic Curve

A true exponential curve cannot continue indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. It must eventually slow down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. The growth stops if the 'E' (exposure) or 'P' (probability of infection) factors decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

Even in a theoretical "perfectly pernicious model" where every infected person is exposed to a random subset of the world's population, growth would cease when most exposed individuals are already sick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This scenario introduces a factor into 'p' that accounts for the probability that a person one is exposed to is *already* infected (e.g., `1 - proportion of people infected`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

Incorporating this factor leads to what is known as a **logistic curve** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This curve is initially indistinguishable from an exponential but eventually levels out as it approaches the total population size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. In reality, "true exponentials essentially never exist in the real world; every one of them is the start of a logistic curve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

The point where the logistic curve shifts from curving upward to curving downward is called the **inflection point** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. At this point, the rate of new cases (represented by the slope of the curve) stops increasing and begins to decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### The Growth Factor

A key metric in [[epidemic_simulations_and_sir_model | epidemic simulations]] is the **growth factor**, defined as the ratio between the number of *new* cases on one day and the number of *new* cases the previous day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

*   During the exponential phase, this factor consistently stays above one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   When the growth factor approaches one, it signals that the inflection point has been reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

This also presents a counterintuitive aspect:
> If the growth factor is one, it could mean you're at the inflection point of a logistic, which would mean the total number of cases is going to max out at about two times wherever you are now. But a growth factor bigger than one, subtle though that might seem, means you're on the exponential part, which could imply there are orders of magnitude of growth still waiting ahead of you. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>

## Beyond Simple Models

While the "saturation point" of an epidemic might theoretically be the entire population, the reality is more complex than random shuffling of infected individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. People are clustered in local communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. However, [[epidemic_simulations_and_sir_model | simulations]] that include even minimal travel between these clusters show similar growth patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. This often results in a fractal pattern where communities themselves act like individuals, each with exposure to others and a probability of spreading the infection, thus adhering to the same underlying [[exponential_growth_and_decay | exponential-inducing laws]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

### Influence of Human Behavior

Fortunately, factors like exposure ('E') and infection probability ('P') can decrease due to human actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. For instance, when people reduce gathering and traveling, exposure goes down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Increased hand washing can lower the infection rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

Another counterintuitive, but optimistic, aspect of [[exponential_growth_and_decay | exponential growth]] is its extreme sensitivity to the constant multiplier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. A small reduction in this growth rate can have a dramatic impact on the projected total cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. For example, if the growth rate drops from 15% to 5%, a projection of over 100 million cases in 61 days could fall to around 400,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This highlights the significant [[impact_of_human_behavior_on_epidemic_growth | impact of human behavior]]:
> So if people are sufficiently worried, there's a lot less to worry about. But if no one is worried, that's when you should worry. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>

Brilliant.org is an online platform that offers puzzles and courses designed to enhance mathematical [[problemsolving_strategies_in_math | problem-solving]] instincts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. They provide content that helps users practice and develop their approach to tricky problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

## The Flipping Pairs Puzzle

One example of a puzzle offered by Brilliant.org is the "Flipping Pairs" sequence within their "Intro to [[ProblemSolving Strategies in Mathematics | Problem Solving]]" course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

The rules of this puzzle involve a series of coins where players can flip adjacent pairs of coins, but not individual coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. The goal is to determine if it's possible to get all three coins to be gold side up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.

### Puzzle Scenarios

*   **Scenario 1:** Starting with a specific configuration, it is possible to make all three coins gold side up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.
*   **Scenario 2:** Starting with a different configuration, it may not be possible to get all three coins gold side up, leading to the conclusion that it's impossible for that specific setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.
*   **Scenario 3:** The puzzle can then extend to asking how many of all possible starting configurations allow for all three gold coins to be up, with the answer being four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

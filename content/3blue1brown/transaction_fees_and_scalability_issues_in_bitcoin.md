In the Bitcoin protocol, transaction fees play a role in incentivizing [[bitcoin_mining_and_block_creation | miners]] and managing the network's capacity. These fees, along with a block reward, make up the total earnings for [[bitcoin_mining_and_block_creation | miners]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>.

## What are Transaction Fees?

When a user initiates a payment on the Bitcoin network, they have the option to include a transaction fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. This fee is paid to the [[bitcoin_mining_and_block_creation | miner]] whose [[bitcoin_mining_and_block_creation | block]] successfully includes that particular payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. The primary reason for including a transaction fee is to incentivize [[bitcoin_mining_and_block_creation | miners]] to include the transaction in the next [[bitcoin_mining_and_block_creation | block]] they create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>.

## Block Size and Transaction Limits

A key factor influencing transaction fees and scalability is the limited capacity of each [[bitcoin_mining_and_block_creation | Bitcoin block]]. Each [[bitcoin_mining_and_block_creation | block]] is restricted to approximately 2,400 transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. Critics of the Bitcoin protocol often argue that this limit is unnecessarily restrictive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.

## Scalability Concerns

The comparative slowness of transaction processing in Bitcoin, largely due to its [[bitcoin_mining_and_block_creation | block]] limit, contributes to higher transaction fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. Because the number of transactions that can be processed in a [[bitcoin_mining_and_block_creation | block]] is limited, fees play a role in determining which transactions [[bitcoin_mining_and_block_creation | miners]] prioritize for inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

For context on processing capacity, Visa processes an average of about 1,700 transactions per second and is capable of handling over 24,000 transactions per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.

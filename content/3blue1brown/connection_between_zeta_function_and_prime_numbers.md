The [[riemann_zeta_function | Riemann zeta function]] is a significant object in modern mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While its definition involves an infinite sum, its extended definition through analytic continuation reveals surprising connections to [[prime_numbers_and_their_regularities | prime numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

## The Riemann Zeta Function
The [[riemann_zeta_function | Riemann zeta function]], denoted as zeta(s), is initially defined for an input 's' as the sum of reciprocals of natural numbers raised to the power of 's':
ζ(s) = 1/1^s + 1/2^s + 1/3^s + 1/4^s + ... <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
This infinite sum converges and makes sense when the real part of 's' is greater than 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. For example, if s = 2, the sum 1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + 1/16 + ... approaches π²/6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Analytic Continuation
For inputs where the real part of 's' is less than or equal to 1, the infinite sum does not converge and yields nonsensical results (e.g., 1 + 2 + 3 + ... does not approach negative 1/12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. However, mathematicians use a process called analytic continuation to extend the definition of the [[riemann_zeta_function | zeta function]] to the entire complex plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.

Analytic continuation is based on the property of analytic functions, which are functions that have a derivative everywhere and preserve angles in their transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. If an analytic function is extended beyond its original domain, requiring the new extended function to also be analytic forces it into one and only one possible extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. This unique extension defines the [[riemann_zeta_function | Riemann zeta function]] for the entire complex plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

## Zeros of the Zeta Function and Prime Numbers
The places where the [[riemann_zeta_function | zeta function]] equals zero are particularly important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

### Trivial Zeros
One known property of this extended function is that it maps all negative even numbers to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. These are called "trivial zeros" because they are well-understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

### Non-Trivial Zeros and the Riemann Hypothesis
The other points where the [[riemann_zeta_function | zeta function]] equals zero, known as non-trivial zeros, sit within a vertical region called the "critical strip" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>. The specific placement of these non-trivial zeros contains surprising information about [[prime_numbers_and_their_regularities | prime numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

The **Riemann Hypothesis** states that all of these non-trivial zeros lie on a specific line in the middle of the critical strip, called the "critical line," where the real part of 's' is one half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

The critical line can be visualized as passing through zero many times after the transformation by the [[riemann_zeta_function | zeta function]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

### Significance of the Connection
If the Riemann Hypothesis is proven true, it would provide a remarkably tight grasp on the pattern of [[prime_numbers_and_their_regularities | prime numbers]] and impact many other mathematical patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. Proving it would also validate hundreds, if not thousands, of modern mathematical results that are contingent on this hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. The Clay Math Institute offers a one million dollar prize for anyone who can prove the Riemann Hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

[[complex_fourier_series_and_rotating_vectors | Complex Fourier series]] describes an animation where each small vector rotates at a constant integer frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. When these vectors are added together, tip to tail, the final tip draws out a specific shape over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. By adjusting the initial size and angle of each vector, virtually any desired shape can be drawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This phenomenon demonstrates how simple individual actions (rotation at a steady rate) can combine to produce complex and coordinated behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This complexity is mathematically controllable just by tuning the starting conditions, given enough "little arrows" (vectors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Historical Context: The Heat Equation

Historically, [[fourier_series_and_their_relation_to_the_heat_equation | Fourier series]] were first described as functions of real numbers broken down into a sum of [[fourier_series_and_sine_waves | sine waves]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This is a special case of the more general rotating vector phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Fourier developed this idea while working on the [[fourier_series_and_their_relation_to_the_heat_equation | heat equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

The [[fourier_series_and_their_relation_to_the_heat_equation | heat equation]] describes how the temperature distribution on a rod evolves over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. It is a linear equation, meaning that if two solutions are known, their sum is also a new solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Solutions for the heat equation are simple if the initial function resembles a cosine wave with frequencies tuned to boundary conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. These waves scale down exponentially over time, with higher frequency waves decaying faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This property allows for constructing custom solutions by combining exponentially decaying cosine waves with chosen constants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

The core insight by Fourier was to ask how to express *any* initial distribution, even a discontinuous step function (like two rods at different uniform temperatures brought into contact), as a sum of [[fourier_series_and_sine_waves | sine waves]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. This question, though seemingly absurd at the time for non-wavy or discontinuous functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, led to [[applications_of_fourier_transform | Fourier series]] becoming synonymous with breaking down functions into combinations of simple oscillations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. The general applicability of [[fourier_series_and_their_relation_to_the_heat_equation | Fourier series]] extends well beyond their origin in [[applications_of_fourier_series_in_heat_distribution | heat distribution]] physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

### Infinite Sums and Approximations

Any finite sum of [[fourier_series_and_sine_waves | sine waves]] cannot perfectly represent a flat or discontinuous function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Fourier broadened this concept by considering infinite sums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. An infinite sum is defined by the limit of its partial sums; the sequence of partial sums approaches a value without necessarily ever equaling it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This allows for qualitative changes, such as an infinite sum of continuous wavy functions equaling a discontinuous flat function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. For example, for a step function, an infinite sum of cosine terms (with specific coefficients for odd frequencies) can represent it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. When applied to the [[fourier_series_and_their_relation_to_the_heat_equation | heat equation]], summing infinitely many solutions associated with cosine waves yields an exact solution for the step function's evolution over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

## Complex Fourier Series and Coefficient Calculation

While [[fourier_series_and_sine_waves | Fourier series]] can be described with real-valued sine and cosine functions, using [[complex_fourier_series_and_rotating_vectors | complex Fourier series]] simplifies computations and provides a clearer understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This approach also lays a foundation for future concepts like the Laplace transform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

In this context, functions are thought of as "drawings" in the 2D complex plane, where an input `t` maps to points in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. The fundamental building block for these functions becomes a sum of little vectors, each rotating at a constant integer frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Functions with real number outputs are considered "boring drawings" confined to one dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. A pair of vectors rotating in opposite directions (e.g., at frequencies 1 and negative 1) sum to produce an oscillation along the real number line, resembling a sine wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Thus, the real-valued [[fourier_series_and_sine_waves | Fourier series]] is a special case of the more general complex approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

The heart of [[complex_fourier_series_and_rotating_vectors | complex Fourier series]] is the complex exponential, `e` to the `i` times `t` (e^it) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. As input `t` progresses, `e^it` traces a path around the unit circle at a rate of one unit per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

Each rotating vector is represented by `c_n * e^(n * 2πit)`, where `c_n` is a complex constant that determines the initial size and direction of the vector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. The goal is to find these coefficients `c_n` for any given function `f(t)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

### Finding the Coefficients (`c_n`)

1.  **Finding `c_0` (the constant term)**:
    This term represents the "center of mass" or average of the drawing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. If samples of `f(t)` are taken evenly from `t = 0` to `t = 1`, the average of their outputs approaches `c_0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. This average is calculated as the integral of `f(t)` from 0 to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.
    When the integral is applied to the sum of all rotating vectors, all terms except `c_0` average to zero because they complete whole rotations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. Only the static `c_0` term remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

2.  **Finding any `c_n` (the general term)**:
    To find a specific `c_n`, the function `f(t)` is first multiplied by `e^(-n * 2πit)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. This effectively "holds still" the `n`-th vector (the one associated with `c_n`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. Multiplying exponentials means adding their exponents, which shifts the frequency term in each vector's exponent down by `n` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.
    After this modification, when the average (integral) of the new function is taken, all vectors other than the `c_n` term will complete some whole number of rotations, averaging out to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. Only the `c_n` term, which is now stationary, will remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.

The general formula for finding the coefficient `c_n` is:
`c_n = ∫[from 0 to 1] f(t) * e^(-n * 2πit) dt` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>

This expression means modifying the 2D drawing (`f(t)`) to make the `n`-th vector hold still, and then performing an average to isolate that still part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

### Practical Implementation

When generating animations or performing computations, these integrals are typically computed [[numerical_computation_and_integration_in_fourier_series | numerically]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. This involves chopping the input interval into many small pieces (`delta t`) and summing the value `f(t) * e^(-n * 2πit) * delta t` for each piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. After computing a range of `c_n` coefficients, they define the initial angle and magnitude for each vector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>. As the vectors rotate and are added tip to tail, the resulting path approximates the original function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. The accuracy of the approximation increases as the number of vectors (and thus `n` values) approaches infinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.

This method allows for the decomposition of any function (e.g., a step function modeling [[applications_of_fourier_series_in_heat_distribution | heat dissipation]]) into its fundamental oscillating components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>. The principles of decomposing functions into combinations of exponentials are fundamental to understanding differential equations, particularly linear ones, and reappear in various forms, such as the Laplace transform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.

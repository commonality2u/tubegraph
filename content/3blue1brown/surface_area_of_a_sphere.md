The surface area of a sphere is given by the formula 4π times its radius squared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, which is exactly four times the area of a circle with the same radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## [[archimedes_proof_of_sphere_surface_area | Archimedes' Proof]]

[[archimedes_proof_of_sphere_surface_area | Archimedes]] devised a beautiful proof demonstrating that the surface area of a sphere is equal to the surface area of a cylinder that perfectly encloses it, excluding the cylinder's circular caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This concept is central to [[comparing_sphere_surface_area_to_enclosing_cylinder | comparing the sphere's surface area to its enclosing cylinder]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### The Projection Method

The fundamental idea involves a [[projection_of_sphere_onto_a_cylinder | projection of the sphere onto the cylinder]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. If light is shone from the z-axis perpendicular to that axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, comparing the area of a small rectangle drawn on the sphere to the area of the shadow it casts on the enclosing cylinder reveals that these two areas are identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

While not immediately obvious, the shadow is a distorted copy of the original small rectangle, being squished in one direction and stretched in another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. However, through [[geometric_reasoning_and_sphere_surface_area | geometric analysis]], these two effects perfectly cancel each other out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This illustrates a key aspect of [[surface_area_of_a_sphere_versus_its_shadow | the relationship between the sphere's surface area and its shadow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

By conceptualizing the sphere as a sum of these small patches and the cylinder as a sum of their corresponding shadows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, it can be inferred that the surface area of the sphere is indeed the same as the lateral surface area of that cylinder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Deriving the Formula

The cylinder's lateral surface can be unrolled into a rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. One side length of this rectangle corresponds to the circumference of the sphere, 2πr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, and the other side corresponds to the height of the sphere, which is 2 times its radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Multiplying these dimensions (2πr * 2r) yields the desired area: 4πr² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

This derivation offers a [[surface_area_of_a_sphere_visual_proof | visual understanding of the sphere's surface area]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Furthermore, if one is familiar with the technique of unwrapping a circle into a triangle (with height 'r' and base '2πr') to find its area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, it becomes evident how four of these unwrapped circles fit perfectly into the unwrapped cylindrical shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

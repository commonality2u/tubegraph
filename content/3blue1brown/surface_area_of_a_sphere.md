The surface area of a sphere is given by the formula 4πr², where 'r' is its radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This value is precisely four times the area of a circle with the same radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## [[Archimedes proof of spheres surface area | Archimedes' Proof]]

[[Archimedes proof of spheres surface area | Archimedes]] presented a significant proof demonstrating that the surface area of a sphere is equivalent to the lateral surface area of a cylinder that perfectly encloses it, disregarding the cylinder's circular caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### The Projection Method
The core idea involves projecting light perpendicular to the z-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. If a small rectangular patch is drawn on the sphere, and its shadow is cast onto the enclosing cylinder, the area of the patch on the sphere is identical to the area of its shadow on the cylinder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

While not immediately apparent, the shadow is a distorted copy of the original rectangle, being squished in one direction and stretched in another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. However, through [[Geometric analysis of sphere and cylinder | geometric analysis]], these opposing effects perfectly cancel each other out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. By treating the sphere as a collection of these small patches and the cylinder's lateral surface as a sum of their corresponding shadows, it can be inferred that the surface area of the sphere matches that of the cylinder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Calculating the Cylinder's Area
The lateral surface of a cylinder can be unwrapped into a rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   One side length of this rectangle corresponds to the cylinder's circumference: 2πr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   The other side length corresponds to the height of the sphere, which is twice its radius: 2r <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

Multiplying these dimensions gives the area: (2πr) × (2r) = 4πr² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## [[Connection between sphere and circle area formulas | Connection to Circle Area]]

A common method to understand a circle's area is by conceptually unwrapping it into a triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This triangle would have a height equal to the circle's radius (r) and a base equal to its circumference (2πr) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. When comparing this unwrapped circle shape to the unwrapped cylinder shape (which forms a rectangle), it becomes clear that four of these unwrapped circles can perfectly fit into the rectangle representing the cylinder's surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This visualization further reinforces why the surface area of a sphere is four times the area of a great circle.

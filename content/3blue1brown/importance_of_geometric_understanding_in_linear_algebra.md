[[Linear algebra foundations | Linear algebra]] is a foundational subject required across many technical disciplines, yet it is often [[challenges_students_face_in_learning_linear_algebra | poorly understood by students taking it for the first time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Students may learn to compute various operations, but frequently lack a deeper conceptual understanding of *why* these operations are defined as they are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## The Disconnect: Numerical vs. Geometric Intuition

A common issue is that students become proficient in the numerical operations of matrices, such as matrix multiplication, [[understanding_determinants_in_linear_algebra | determinants]], cross products, or eigenvalues, without fully grasping the underlying geometric intuitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. For example, they might not understand:
*   Why matrix multiplication is defined in a particular way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   The relationship between a cross product and a [[understanding_determinants_in_linear_algebra | determinant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   What an eigenvalue truly represents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

### Consequences of Lacking Geometric Understanding
Without a solid [[connection_between_numerical_and_geometric_understandings | geometric understanding]], problems can go unnoticed for a while, emerging later in advanced fields like computer science, engineering, statistics, economics, or even pure mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. When confronted with scenarios assuming fluency, the application of [[linear_algebra_foundations | linear algebra]] by professors or colleagues might seem like "utter magic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Experts can quickly discern the right tool and anticipate the approximate answer, which might appear as "computational wizardry" to those who only grasp the numerical calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

#### Analogy: Sine Function Without Geometry
Consider learning the sine function solely as an infinite polynomial expansion, without understanding its relation to triangles or [[coordinate_systems_in_linear_algebra | geometry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. If later in a physics course, sines and cosines are applied intuitively, it would be intimidating, making it seem as if only those with "computers for brains" are suited for the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This feeling of being "unduly slow or dumb" is analogous to the experience of students in [[linear_algebra_foundations | linear algebra]] who lack geometric intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## The Value of Geometric Intuition

There is a fundamental difference between understanding [[linear_algebra_foundations | linear algebra]] on a numeric level and on a [[connection_between_numerical_and_geometric_understandings | geometric level]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Both have their place:
*   **Geometric understanding** allows one to judge which tools to use for specific problems, comprehend *why* they work, and correctly interpret results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Numerical understanding** is essential for actually carrying out the application of those tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

Luckily, much like trigonometry, [[linear_algebra_foundations | linear algebra]] is underpinned by a handful of visual intuitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The [[connection_between_numerical_and_geometric_understandings | relationship between computation and these visual intuitions]] is typically straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. When this relationship between [[using_geometry_for_understanding_probability | geometry]] and numbers is understood, the subject's details and practical applications become much more reasonable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Bridging the Gap in Education

While most professors attempt to convey geometric understanding, many courses still lead students to spend a disproportionate amount of time on the numerical side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. In practice, computers handle the numerical computations, leaving humans to focus on the conceptual aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### An [[overview_of_upcoming_series_on_linear_algebra | Upcoming Series]]
A future series aims to animate these intuitions, starting with the basics of [[understanding_vectors_in_linear_algebra | vectors]] and progressing through core [[linear_algebra_foundations | linear algebra]] topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. The goal is not to teach the entire subject, but to provide the right intuitions to make future learning more productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. This can also serve as an [[educational_resources_for_teaching_linear_algebra | educational resource]] for educators who need to direct students for a quick brush-up on [[linear_algebra_foundations | linear algebra]] fluency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. It is recommended that viewers pause and ponder as needed, as self-reflection is crucial for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

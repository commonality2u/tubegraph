An animation, created by Paul D'Steff, visually demonstrates cosmic distances by zooming out by a factor of 10 every 3 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This animation was part of a series of videos explaining how we determine the [[distance_measurement_in_the_cosmos | distances to various objects in the cosmos]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Visualizing Cosmic Distances

The animation effectively illustrates the immense emptiness of space; for instance, as it departs the solar system, it traverses "many seemingly blank orders of magnitude" before the first star appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

### Limitations of "Powers of 10" Zooms

However, these "powers of 10" zoom-out animations can inadvertently "undersell the true [[scale_of_the_universe | Scale of the Universe]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The implied camera speed far exceeds the cosmic speed limit (the speed of light), making distant objects like other galaxies appear more accessible than they truly are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. In reality, traveling at the speed of light would still take approximately 2.5 million years to reach the nearest galaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### The Challenge of Scientific Accuracy in Representation

Creating the end of the zoom-out animation posed a challenge due to the desire for scientific accuracy without resorting to artistic renditions of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## The Slone Galactic Survey

To maintain accuracy, the animation concludes with a simple point cloud representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This data is derived from the **Slone Galactic Survey** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

> "The Slone Galactic Survey... essentially maps the distances to various galaxies at many different directions you could point in the sky." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>

### Significance of Galaxy Mapping

The ability to map these galaxies, despite them being millions and billions of light-years away and "completely beyond our grasp," is considered a "mind-boggling testament to the powers of Science and deduction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This mapping allows for the study of patterns like the clusters and strands that billions of galaxies form in the vastness of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

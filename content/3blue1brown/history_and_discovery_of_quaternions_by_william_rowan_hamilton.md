Quaternions represent a fascinating and often underappreciated number system in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. They are a four-dimensional extension of [[complex_numbers_as_a_foundation_for_understanding_quaternions | complex numbers]], much like [[complex_numbers_introduction | complex numbers]] are a two-dimensional extension of real numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Beyond their mathematical significance, quaternions possess a surprising practical utility for [[applications_of_quaternions_in_threedimensional_rotations_and_quantum_mechanics | describing rotation in three dimensions]] and even in [[applications_of_quaternions_in_threedimensional_rotations_and_quantum_mechanics | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## The Search for a 3D Number System

The story of the discovery of quaternions is renowned in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton dedicated a significant portion of his life to finding a three-dimensional number system that would be analogous to [[complex_numbers_introduction | complex numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. His son would reportedly ask him daily if he had figured out how to "divide triples," to which Hamilton consistently replied, "no, not yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## The "Flash of Insight"

On October 16, 1843, while crossing the Broom Bridge in Dublin, Hamilton experienced a sudden flash of insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. He realized that instead of adding a single dimension to [[complex_numbers_introduction | complex numbers]], he needed to add two more imaginary dimensions, totaling three imaginary dimensions, with the real numbers sitting perpendicularly in a kind of fourth dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

This revelation led him to carve the crucial equation describing these three imaginary units into the bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Today, a plaque on the bridge commemorates this event, displaying that equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

At the time of Hamilton's discovery, the modern concept of [[linear_algebra_foundations | vectors]] with their [[historical_mathematics_notation_and_conventions | dot product]] and [[historical_mathematics_notation_and_conventions | cross product]] did not exist in a standardized form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Early Reception and Controversy

Following his breakthrough, Hamilton vigorously advocated for quaternions to become the primary language for teaching students how to describe three-dimensional space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. He even established an official Quaternion Society to promote his discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

However, mathematicians on the other side of the debate argued that the "confusing notion" of [[quaternion_multiplication_and_fourdimensional_geometry | quaternion multiplication]] was unnecessary for describing three dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This opposition led to "hilarious old-timey trash talk," with some legitimately calling them "evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. It is even believed that the Mad Hatter scene in *Alice in Wonderland* – whose author was an Oxford mathematician – was a reference to quaternions, mocking their [[quaternion_multiplication_and_fourdimensional_geometry | multiplication]] through chaotic table placement and referencing their non-commutative nature with certain quotes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Resurgence in the Modern Era

Approximately a century later, the computing industry spurred a resurgence of quaternions, particularly among programmers working with graphics, robotics, and anything involving orientation in 3D space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This is due to their elegant way of describing and computing 3D rotations, which is computationally more efficient and avoids many numerical errors found in other methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

The 20th century also saw quaternions gain favor in [[applications_of_quaternions_in_threedimensional_rotations_and_quantum_mechanics | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The special actions that quaternions describe in four dimensions are highly relevant to the mathematical description of two-state systems, such as electron spin or photon polarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

While algebraic definitions of [[quaternion_multiplication_and_fourdimensional_geometry | quaternion multiplication]] exist and are used computationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>, a deeper understanding, akin to the [[importance_of_geometric_understanding_in_linear_algebra | geometric understanding]] of [[complex_numbers_introduction | complex numbers]], comes from comprehending their four-dimensional [[geometry of complex numbers | geometry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.

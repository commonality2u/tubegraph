One of the most pivotal discoveries in the history of physics involved observing the moons of Jupiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Specifically, the moon Io, which regularly goes dark as it enters Jupiter's massive shadow and then becomes bright again upon emergence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. By consistently monitoring Io through a telescope, astronomers could mark the exact time it reappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## The Anomaly of Io's Orbit

Initially, Io's reappearances seemed to occur in precise 42-hour increments, like clockwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. However, this regularity proved inconsistent; at different times of the year, Io was observed to be either ahead or behind schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This discrepancy was linked to the changing distance between Earth and Jupiter as both planets orbit the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

When Earth was on the same side of the Sun as Jupiter, Io's emergence was observed 20 minutes earlier than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Conversely, when Earth was on the opposite side of the Sun from Jupiter, it took 20 minutes longer for Io to appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## [[Huygens and the speed of light | Huygens']] Realization

After precise calculations based on these observations, [[Huygens and the speed of light | Huygens]] deduced that this varying delay was due to light taking time to traverse the changing distance between Earth and Jupiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The 20-minute difference corresponded to the time light needed to travel an additional two [[distance measurement in the cosmos | astronomical units]] (AU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Early Estimates and Significance

At the time of this discovery, the precise value of an [[distance measurement in the cosmos | astronomical unit]] was not accurately known, which meant early estimates for the speed of light were not highly accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Despite this, the experiment was profoundly significant because it provided the first evidence that light possessed a finite speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Previously, for most experiments conducted on Earth, light's propagation appeared instantaneous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

[[Astronomical observations and their impact on physics | Astronomical scales]] revealed that light, though incredibly fast, is not instantaneous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This clever method of using Io's eclipses, despite its initial imprecision, laid the essential groundwork for later, more precise experiments conducted on Earth, as it provided an initial understanding of light's approximate speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## The Tease of Geometry

Mathematics can be a "real tease" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It draws us in with the beauty of reasoning geometrically in two and three dimensions, where there's a seamless interplay between numbers and spatial concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. For instance, considering a [[geometry_and_circles | circle]] with radius 1 centered at the origin allows us to conceptualize every pair of numbers (x, y) satisfying the numerical property x² + y² = 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This connection is incredibly useful, as many facts that seem abstract analytically become clear geometrically, and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This principle, specifically the link between sums of squares and [[geometry_of_spheres_and_cylinders | circles]] and [[highdimensional spheres | spheres]], is central to understanding mathematical concepts like Pi's connection to number theory, visualizing Pythagorean triples, and using topological facts about [[highdimensional spheres | spheres]] to solve counting puzzles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

However, this beauty becomes a "tease" when questions arise about quadruplets, quintuplets, or 100-tuples of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Our physical space constrains our geometric intuition, causing us to lose this invaluable back-and-forth between numbers and spatial reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Problems that could have elegant solutions remain elusive because we lack a way to conceptualize lists of many numbers as individual points in some space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

For mathematicians, computer scientists, and physicists, problems involving lists of more than three numbers are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The standard approach to doing math in [[higher_dimensions_and_their_relevance | higher dimensions]] is to use two and three dimensions for analogy, but fundamentally reason analytically, much like a pilot relying on instruments instead of sight when flying through clouds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### A Hybrid Approach: Sliders and "Real Estate"

A method that bridges purely geometric and purely analytic views offers a way to make analytic reasoning more visual and generalize to arbitrarily [[higher_dimensions_and_their_relevance | high dimensions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The focus here will be on [[highdimensional spheres | higher dimensional spheres]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. For example, a four-dimensional sphere with radius one centered at the origin is the set of all quadruplets (x, y, z, w) where the sum of their squares is one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Visualizing three-dimensional slices of a 4D sphere projected into three dimensions can be confusing and doesn't scale to even [[higher_dimensions_and_their_relevance | higher dimensions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

Instead, a more literal approach involves picturing multiple vertical number lines with sliders, one for each coordinate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Each configuration of these sliders represents a point in N-dimensional space (e.g., a quadruplet in 4D space) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. For a unit sphere centered at the origin, the condition is that the sum of the squares of these values equals one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. The goal is to understand how slider movements correspond to movements on the sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

This concept is simplified by thinking in two dimensions:
*   **"Real Estate" Analogy**: The value of x² is considered the "real estate" belonging to x, and y² to y. They share a total of one unit of real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Movement on a Circle**: Moving around the circle means a constant exchange of real estate between the variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Real Estate Value**: Real estate is "cheap" near zero and "expensive" farther away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. For example, moving x from 1 to 0.9 (losing 0.19 real estate) requires y to move 0.44 units from 0 to gain the same amount of "cheap" real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This corresponds to the steep slope on a circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   Adding tick marks to show 0.05 units of real estate reveals a "piston dance" motion, where sliders move slower away from zero due to more "expensive" real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The square root of the total real estate gives the distance from the origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

For a unit sphere in three dimensions, a third slider (z) is added, sharing the same one unit of real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Holding x at 0.5 (occupying 0.25 real estate) means y and z trade off the remaining 0.75 units, creating a circular slice, just as slicing a sphere along a plane where x is constant yields a circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. As x increases, less real estate remains for y and z, making the circular slice smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. When x reaches 1, no real estate is left, forcing y and z to be 0, a singularity point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. This perspective offers a "bug-on-the-surface" feel, providing local understanding of movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

In [[higher_dimensions_and_their_relevance | four dimensions]] and beyond, the rules of real estate exchange remain consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Fixing one slider in a 4D sphere allows the other three to trade off, forming a 3D sphere slice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

## The Counterintuitive Box Problem

To demonstrate the value of this hybrid approach, consider a classic problem that seems reasonable in two and three dimensions but becomes "totally out of whack" in [[higher_dimensions_and_their_relevance | higher dimensions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

### Two Dimensions

Imagine a 2x2 box centered at the origin, with corners at (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), and (-1,-1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Draw four [[geometry_and_circles | circles]], each with radius 1, centered at these four vertices, so they are tangent to their neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. The goal is to find the radius of an inner [[geometry_and_circles | circle]] centered at the origin that is just large enough to touch these four corner [[geometry_and_circles | circles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, the distance from the origin to a corner (e.g., (1,1)) is √2 (approx. 1.414) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Subtracting the radius of a corner [[geometry_and_circles | circle]] (which is 1) gives the inner [[geometry_and_circles | circle]]'s radius: √2 - 1, or about 0.414 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. This result feels intuitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Three Dimensions

In three dimensions, draw a 2x2x2 cube with corners like (1,1,1), (1,1,-1), etc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Eight [[geometry_of_spheres_and_cylinders | spheres]], each with radius 1, are centered at these vertices, tangent to three neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. The distance from the origin to a corner (e.g., (1,1,1)) is found by adding the squares of components and taking the square root, following the [[exploring_fourdimensional_geometry_and_its_implications | Pythagorean theorem]]'s extension to [[higher_dimensions_and_their_relevance | higher dimensions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. For (1,1,1), the distance is √(1² + 1² + 1²) = √3 (approx. 1.73) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Subtracting the corner sphere's radius (1) gives the inner sphere's radius: √3 - 1, or about 0.73 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Again, this seems reasonable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

### Analyzing the Box Problem with Sliders

To understand what happens to the inner radius as dimensions increase, we re-evaluate the 2D and 3D cases using the slider analogy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

For a [[geometry_and_circles | circle]] centered at a corner like (1,-1), the "real estate" depends on the distance of each coordinate from its respective center (1 for x, -1 for y) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. The "piston dance" trade-off remains the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

The point of tangency between the inner [[geometry_and_circles | circle]] and a corner [[geometry_and_circles | circle]] occurs when the x and y coordinates are the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. At this point, the "real estate" (distance from the corner center) is shared evenly between x and y <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. Any perturbation away from this even split results in an increasing distance from the origin (0,0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. Since this point is tangent to the inner [[geometry_and_circles | circle]], it's also a point on the inner [[geometry_and_circles | circle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

*   **2D Case Re-examined**: At the tangent point, both x and y coordinates are below 0.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. The total real estate (x² + y²) measured from the origin (0,0) is less than 0.5² + 0.5² = 0.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. This means the inner circle's radius is less than 1.

*   **3D Case Re-examined**: For a corner sphere centered at (1,1,1), the point closest to the origin where tangency occurs is when x, y, and z are equal and "reaching down towards 0" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. These coordinates must go a little beyond 0.5 because 0.5² (0.25) for each coordinate would sum to 0.75, which is too much real estate if they are equally splitting 1 unit of real estate. So they must be further out than 0.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. Viewing this as a point on the inner sphere relative to the origin (0,0,0), the total real estate (x² + y² + z²) is less than 0.75, confirming the inner sphere is smaller than the corner spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

### The Higher-Dimensional Twist

Things become "interesting" in [[exploring_fourdimensional_geometry_and_its_implications | four dimensions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. A 2x2x2x2 box has 16 vertices (combinations of 1 and -1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. There are 16 unit [[highdimensional spheres | spheres]] centered at these corners, each tangent to four neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. For a corner sphere centered at (1,1,1,1), the point closest to the origin is when all four coordinates are exactly halfway between 1 and 0 (i.e., 0.5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

*   **4D Case**: When measured from the origin (0,0,0,0), each of these four coordinates at 0.5 has 0.25 units of real estate (0.5²). This makes a total of 1 (0.25 * 4) unit of real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.
    *   This means the inner sphere is *precisely the same size* as the corner [[highdimensional spheres | spheres]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. Numerically, the distance from the origin to (1,1,1,1) is √4 = 2. Subtracting the corner sphere's radius (1) gives an inner radius of 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.
    *   This inner sphere, with radius 1, actually touches the 2x2x2x2 box at points like (1,0,0,0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. This seems counterintuitive when thinking in 2D or 3D, where the inner sphere is always smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

*   **5D Case**: In five dimensions, there are 32 corner [[highdimensional spheres | spheres]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. For the sphere centered at (1,1,1,1,1), the point closest to the origin (where all five coordinates equally split one unit of shared real estate) means each coordinate is a little *higher* than 0.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. If they were at 0.5, the total real estate would be 1.25, which is too much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.
    *   When viewed from the origin, this configuration has *more than one unit* of real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. The radius of the inner sphere is about 1.24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.
    *   This means the five-dimensional inner sphere *pokes outside the box* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>.

*   **10D Case**: In ten dimensions, points have ten coordinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. For a unit sphere, one unit of real estate is shared among ten coordinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>. The point of the corner sphere closest to the origin, where all ten coordinates split real estate evenly, feels "very far away from the origin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>.
    *   The radius of the inner sphere is about 2.16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.
    *   This inner sphere is large enough to poke outside a 4x4x4x... bounding box, since its diameter is greater than four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. The face of the box is always two units from the origin, regardless of dimension, because it involves moving along a single axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. However, a corner like (1,1,...,1) is very far from the center in [[higher_dimensions_and_their_relevance | high dimensions]] because each of the ten dimensions adds a full unit of real estate for that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>.
    *   As dimensions increase, the inner sphere continues to grow without bound, and the proportion of the inner sphere lying inside the box decreases exponentially towards zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.

## Conclusion

The "slider method" for visualizing [[higher_dimensions_and_their_relevance | higher dimensions]] helps to demystify concepts that might otherwise seem "metaphysical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. It allows for concrete thought about [[highdimensional spheres | high-dimensional shapes]] and their properties, such as the counterintuitive behavior of the inner sphere in the box problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.

While this method has limitations—it offers a "bug on the surface" view, only getting a feel for one point at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>, and it is coordinate-dependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>—it provides a crucial foothold for understanding [[highdimensional geometry and cube coloring | high-dimensional geometry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. By representing each coordinate literally and using analogies like "real estate," it sheds light on seemingly strange aspects of [[higher_dimensions_and_their_relevance | high dimensions]], such as the immense distance of a box corner from its center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. This direct representation of analytic descriptions faithfully reflects how mathematicians genuinely engage with [[higher_dimensions_and_their_relevance | higher dimensions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>. It re-engineers our "instruments of analytic reasoning" to leverage our brain's image processing capabilities, demonstrating that even if something cannot be fully visualized, it can still be thought about visually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.

The idea of adding an [[infinite_series_and_sum_computations | infinite series]] of numbers might seem illogical, especially when considering a sum like 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 and continuing indefinitely. Yet, in a specific mathematical sense, this particular [[infinite_series_and_sum_computations | infinite sum]] can be understood to equal negative 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Initially, this notion might appear counter-intuitive or even false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Discovering Convergent Infinite Sums

To grasp such paradoxical results, it's helpful to first understand how mathematicians came to define [[discovery_and_definition_of_convergent_sums | convergent infinite sums]]—those [[infinite_series_and_sum_computations | sums]] that intuitively "make sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Consider the [[infinite_series_and_sum_computations | sum]] ½ + ¼ + ⅛ + 1/16, continuing to infinity, which equals 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

One way to conceptualize this involves imagining two objects on a number line, one at 0 and the other at 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. As the first object marches towards the second, the distance between them is halved with each step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The positions the object touches are ½, then ½ + ¼, then ½ + ¼ + ⅛, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Geometrically, these numbers clearly approach 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, leading to the desire to state that 1 is equivalent to this [[infinite_series_and_sum_computations | infinite sum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### Defining "Approach" and Infinite Sums

The challenge lies in defining what it means to "add infinitely many things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The key insight is that no infinite number of operations are actually performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Instead, one considers a list of numbers, each derived from a perfectly reasonable finite sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. The crucial question then becomes: what does it mean for these numbers to "approach" a value, like 1? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>

It's not merely that the distance between each number in the list and 1 gets smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The special quality of 1 is that the numbers in the list can get *arbitrarily close* to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This means that no matter how small a desired distance is chosen (e.g., 0.01, 0.000001), eventually, further down the list, all subsequent numbers will fall within that tiny distance of 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

This leads to the formal definition of an [[infinite_series_and_sum_computations | infinite sum]]:
> An [[infinite_series_and_sum_computations | infinite sum]] equals a number *x* if, when a list of numbers is generated by cutting off the sum at finite points, the numbers in this list approach *x* in the sense that no matter how small the distance chosen, at some point down the list, all the numbers start falling within that distance of *x* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

This definition, while appearing clear in retrospect, was an incredibly clever advancement in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## Generalizing Infinite Sums

This new definition allows for the generalization of [[infinite_series_and_sum_computations | infinite sums]]. For example, by cutting an interval into proportions other than half (e.g., nine tenths and one tenth), one can deduce that 0.999... (nine tenths + nine hundredths + nine thousandths...) equals 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This demonstrates that with [[infinite_series_and_sum_computations | infinite sums]], "to approach" and "to equal" mean the same thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

More generally, for any *p* between 0 and 1, the [[infinite_series_and_sum_computations | sum]] 1 + p + p² + p³ + ... equals 1/(1-p) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This is the formula for a geometric series.

### Challenging the Boundaries of Definition

While this formula makes sense for *p* between 0 and 1, it yields surprising results when *p* is outside this range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   Plugging in *p* = -1, the equation becomes 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + ... = 1/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The sequence of finite sums (1, 0, 1, 0, ...) does not *approach* a single number in the traditional sense, but 1/2 feels like the "only thing it could be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   Plugging in *p* = 2, the equation becomes 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... = -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. The finite sums (1, 3, 7, 15, 31...) clearly do not approach -1 under the established definition of approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

This leads to a dilemma: either dismiss these results as nonsensical because they don't fit the existing definition, or seek new forms of math where they *do* make sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## Reinterpreting Distance: p-adic Metrics

To make sense of sums like 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... = -1, mathematicians had to reconsider a fundamental assumption: the way distance between numbers is defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Our usual notion of distance arranges numbers on a line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

A "notion of distance" is a function that takes two numbers and indicates how far apart they are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. For a new distance function to be useful, it should share properties with the familiar one, such as *shift invariance* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. This means the distance between two numbers shouldn't change if the same amount is added to both (e.g., the distance between 0 and 4 is the same as between 1 and 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

The goal is to find a notion of distance where powers of two (2, 4, 8, 16...) approach zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. This can be achieved by organizing numbers into a hierarchy of "rooms," "sub-rooms," and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

### The 2-adic Metric

Imagine 0 being in the same large "room" as all powers of two (2, 4, 8, ...). It's also in a smaller "sub-room" with powers of two greater than two (4, 8, 16, ...), and an even smaller "sub-sub-room" with powers of two greater than four (8, 16, 32, ...) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Due to shift invariance, this arrangement dictates where other numbers fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. For example, negative one must be in smaller and smaller rooms with numbers one less than a power of two (1, 3, 7, 15, ...), because zero is in smaller and smaller rooms with the powers of two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

This conceptual framework leads to a new way of defining distance:
*   Numbers in different large "yellow" rooms are a distance of 1 from each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
*   Numbers in the same large room but different "orange" sub-rooms are a distance of ½ from each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
*   Numbers in the same orange sub-room but different "sub-sub-rooms" are a distance of ¼ from each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

This continues, using reciprocals of increasing powers of 2 to indicate closeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. This is known as the **2-adic metric** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. It is a perfectly legitimate notion of distance, part of a family of [[infinite_math_utility_in_finite_contexts | p-adic metrics]] (where *p* is any prime number) that give rise to entirely new types of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

Using the 2-adic metric, the [[infinite_series_and_sum_computations | sum]] of all powers of 2 (1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ...) genuinely equals negative 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>, because the sequence of finite sums (1, 3, 7, 15, 31...) *does* approach negative 1 under this new definition of distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

This illustrates a recurring pattern in mathematical [[discovery_and_definition_of_convergent_sums | discovery and definition of convergent sums]]:
1.  Nature or intuition presents an ill-defined or seemingly nonsensical truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.
2.  New mathematical concepts are defined to make this fuzzy discovery rigorous and understandable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.
3.  These new concepts often yield genuinely useful mathematics and broaden our understanding of traditional notions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. This process reflects a [[concept_of_duality_in_math | duality]] between discovery and invention in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

The relationship between [[rationality_in_human_judgment | rational]] and irrational numbers plays a significant role in understanding [[musical_harmony_and_frequency_ratios | musical harmony]]. A primary challenge in music is to determine if a given ratio (R) between the frequencies of two musical notes will result in a pleasant or unpleasant sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Pythagorean Harmony

Traditionally, two notes are considered to sound harmonious together when their frequency ratio is a [[rationality_in_human_judgment | rational number]], and cacophonous when the ratio is irrational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

Examples of harmonious [[rationality_in_human_judgment | rational ratios]] include:
*   **3/2**: A musical fifth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>
*   **4/3**: A musical fourth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>
*   **8/5**: A major sixth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>

This concept is theorized to stem from the brain's ability to detect patterns. When the frequency ratio is [[rationality_in_human_judgment | rational]], there is a detectable pattern in the beats, which, when slowed down, is perceived as a rhythm rather than a harmony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The brain picks up on this pattern, making the notes sound pleasant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Complexity of Rational Numbers

However, not all [[rationality_in_human_judgment | rational numbers]] result in pleasant sounds. Many, like 211/198 or 1093/826, sound cacophonous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This is because these [[rationality_in_human_judgment | rational numbers]] are more "complicated" than the simple ones, and the ear struggles to pick up on their beat patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

A simple way to measure the complexity of [[rationality_in_human_judgment | rational numbers]] is by considering the size of the denominator when the fraction is written in reduced form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Harmonious ratios often have low denominators (e.g., less than 10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## The Role of Irrational Numbers and Tuning

Despite the emphasis on [[rationality_in_human_judgment | rational numbers]], many notes sound good together even when their frequency ratio is irrational, provided it is *close* to a harmonious [[rationality_in_human_judgment | rational number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This is crucial for modern musical instruments like pianos.

Pianos and other instruments are often not tuned using strict [[rationality_in_human_judgment | rational intervals]]. Instead, each half-step increase corresponds to multiplying the original frequency by the 12th root of 2, which is an irrational number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

For example:
*   A musical fifth, expected to be 3/2 (rational), is actually 2^(7/12) on a piano, which is irrational but very close to 3/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   A musical fourth corresponds to 2^(5/12), which is irrational but very close to 4/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

The effectiveness of the 12-note chromatic scale is due to the "strange tendency" of powers of the 12th root of 2 to be within a 1% margin of error of simple [[rationality_in_human_judgment | rational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Refined Definition of Harmony

Based on these observations, a ratio R might be considered harmonious if it is sufficiently close to a [[rationality_in_human_judgment | rational number]] with a sufficiently small denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. The degree of "closeness" depends on the listener's ear, and the "smallness" of the denominator depends on the intricacy of harmonic patterns the ear can perceive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

A person with a highly acute musical sense might even find pleasure in more complicated [[rationality_in_human_judgment | rational fractions]] (e.g., 23/21 or 35/43) and numbers closely approximating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## The Musical Savant and Measure Theory

Consider a hypothetical musical savant who finds pleasure in *all* pairs of notes with a [[rationality_in_human_judgment | rational]] frequency ratio, even the "super complicated" ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. This raises a question: Would such a savant find *all* ratios R (including irrational ones) between 1 and 2 harmonious, given that any real number can be arbitrarily approximated by a [[rationality_in_human_judgment | rational number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>?

This question connects to a foundational result in measure theory, which provides the formal underpinning for integration and probability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. A key concept involves covering [[rationality_in_human_judgment | rational numbers]] with open intervals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

### Covering Rational Numbers

It is possible to cover all [[rationality_in_human_judgment | rational numbers]] between 0 and 1 with an infinite number of open intervals, such that the *sum of the lengths* of these intervals is strictly less than 1 (and can even be arbitrarily small, like 0.01) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. This is surprising because [[rationality_in_human_judgment | rational numbers]] are dense in the real numbers, meaning any continuous stretch, no matter how small, contains infinitely many of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

The method involves enumerating the [[rationality_in_human_judgment | rational numbers]] into an ordered list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Then, an open interval is assigned to each [[rationality_in_human_judgment | rational number]] in the list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. The lengths of these intervals are chosen to form a convergent infinite sum (e.g., 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ...) scaled by an arbitrarily small epsilon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Intervals assigned to [[rationality_in_human_judgment | rational numbers]] later in the list (which have larger denominators) become very small, very fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

### Intuition and Connection to Harmony

This counterintuitive result demonstrates that even though [[rationality_in_human_judgment | rational numbers]] are dense, the "space" they occupy can be made arbitrarily small. If, for instance, the total length of the covering intervals is 0.3, then there's a 70% chance that a randomly chosen number between 0 and 1 falls *outside* these intervals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

For an irrational number like the square root of 2 over 2, it would likely be among the 70% not covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. This is because any sequence of [[rationality_in_human_judgment | rational numbers]] approaching an irrational number will have its covering intervals shrink faster than the sequence converges, especially if those [[rationality_in_human_judgment | rational numbers]] have large denominators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

In musical terms, this formalizes the vague idea that the only [[rationality_in_human_judgment | rational numbers]] close to a "cacophonous" irrational number (like the square root of 2 over 2) have large denominators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. The irrationals that remain "uncovered" by these small intervals are those that cannot be well-approximated by simple [[rationality_in_human_judgment | rational numbers]].

If we shift this setup to the musical interval from 1 to 2, and use an epsilon of 0.01 (meaning only 1% of the length is covered by intervals), almost all the numbers covered by these tiny intervals are harmonious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. This includes the harmonious irrational number 2^(7/12) (close to 3/2) and 2^(5/12) (close to 4/3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. The cacophonous numbers in this 1% would be those [[rationality_in_human_judgment | rational numbers]] with high denominators and the irrationals very close to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

### Conclusion

The surprising connection is that the ability to densely populate a range with intervals covering only a tiny fraction of its values directly corresponds to the idea that harmonious numbers are rare, even for a savant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. For the savant who finds *all* [[rationality_in_human_judgment | rational numbers]] harmonious, the "harmonious" numbers could be precisely that 1% covered by the intervals, assuming her tolerance for error decreases exponentially for more complicated [[rationality_in_human_judgment | rational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. This implies that even for her, 99% of all ratios could still be perceived as cacophonous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

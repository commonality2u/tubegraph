This article explores common pitfalls in mathematical proofs, focusing on visual intuition and limiting arguments. It details two "fake proofs" concerning the surface area of a sphere and the properties of triangles, explaining why they are flawed.

## The Flawed "Proof" for Sphere Surface Area

A common, yet incorrect, visual "proof" attempts to derive the formula for the [[Surface area of a sphere | surface area of a sphere]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

The method begins by subdividing the sphere into vertical slices, similar to chopping an orange or painting a beach ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. These wedge slices from the northern hemisphere are then unraveled to point upwards, and symmetrically, those from the southern hemisphere are unraveled downwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The pieces are then interlaced to form a shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

The base of this interlaced shape is claimed to be the circumference of the sphere, an unraveled equator, with a length of 2πR, where R is the radius of the sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The height of the shape is derived from a quarter of a walk around the sphere (from pole to equator), giving a length of πR/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

The underlying idea is that as these slices become finer and finer, the resulting shape approximates a perfect rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The area of this "rectangle" would then be (πR/2) * (2πR) = π²R² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Why the Sphere Proof is Flawed

Despite its elegance and intuitive appeal, this "proof" is completely wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The true [[Surface area of a sphere | surface area of a sphere]] is 4πR² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The discrepancy means that for the proof to be consistent with the true formula, π would have to equal 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

The main problem lies in the assumption that the orange wedges, when flattened out, would look like triangles or have straight sides that can be accurately interlaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. If done accurately to preserve area, these wedges would bulge outward, particularly around their bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

The width of a wedge changes non-linearly as one moves from the top (pole) to the bottom (equator) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. This variation follows a sine curve, not a linear progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. Consequently, when interlacing the wedges, there is a "meaningful amount of overlap" between their non-linear edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. This overlap persists even with finer subdivisions and accounts for the difference between the incorrect π²R² and the correct 4πR² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

### Comparison with Circle Area Proof

The sphere argument is similar in spirit to a valid visual proof for the area of a circle, which starts by dividing it into pizza-like wedges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. These wedges are straightened out, aligning their crusts, and then interlaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. As slices become thinner, the shape approaches a true rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. The width of this rectangle is half the circumference (πR), and its height is the radius (R), yielding an area of πR² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

The crucial difference lies in the [[Geometry of spheres and cylinders | geometry of spheres and cylinders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. The [[Connection between sphere and circle area formulas | fundamental issue]] for the sphere is that a curved surface's geometry differs from flat space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. It's impossible to flatten a sphere without losing geometric information due to its [[Gaussian curvature]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. Limiting arguments involving flattening pieces on a sphere only work if the pieces shrink in *both* directions, making them appear locally flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. The orange wedges only got thin in one direction, maintaining their curvature in the other, leading to persistent overlap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

## The Flawed "Proof" That All Triangles are Isosceles

Another "proof" attempts to demonstrate that all triangles are isosceles (and by extension, equilateral) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. This proof uses Euclidean-style geometric constructions:

1.  **Start with an arbitrary triangle ABC.** The goal is to prove that side length AB equals AC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
2.  **Draw the perpendicular bisector of side BC.** Label its intersection with BC as D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
3.  **Draw the angle bisector of angle A.** Label its intersection with the perpendicular bisector at P <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
4.  **Draw perpendicular lines from P to sides AC and AB.** Label the intersection points E on AC and F on AB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

**Congruence Claims:**

*   Triangle AFP is congruent to triangle AEP (Angle-Side-Angle: AP shared, angles alpha equal, right angles at F and E) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This implies AF = AE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   Draw lines PB and PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Triangle PDB is congruent to triangle PDC (Side-Angle-Side: PD shared, BD=DC, right angles at D) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. This implies PB = PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   Triangle FPB is congruent to triangle EPC (Side-Side-Angle: PB=PC, FP=EP from first congruence, right angles at F and E) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. This implies FB = EC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

**Conclusion:**

By adding the corresponding lengths (AF + FB = AB) and (AE + EC = AC), the proof concludes that AB = AC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Since the triangle was arbitrary, this implies all triangles are isosceles, and by extension, equilateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

### Why the Triangle Proof is Flawed

The result is obviously false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. The flaw in this Euclid-style proof is incredibly subtle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

When the angle bisector and perpendicular bisector are drawn carefully (not just eyeballed), their intersection point (P) actually sits *outside* the triangle for many cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.

While all the congruence claims are genuinely true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>, the breakdown occurs at the final step: the summation of lengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. The statement AC = AE + EC is only valid under the hidden assumption that point E lies *between* A and C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. In reality, for many triangles, E (and F) will sit *outside* the segment AC (or AB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

### Lessons Learned from "Fake Proofs"

These examples highlight several important lessons in mathematics:

*   **Limits and Continuity**: The second example (pi = 4) illustrates that the limit of lengths of curves is not necessarily the length of the limiting curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. This emphasizes the need for care when applying limiting arguments, as seen throughout calculus, such as in approximating areas under curves with rectangles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.
*   **Visual Intuition vs. Rigor**: While visual intuition and diagrams are powerful tools for understanding, they cannot replace rigorous proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>. [[Mathematical proofs involving inscribed rectangles | Mathematical proofs]] require deducing truths step-by-step from axioms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Hidden Assumptions and Edge Cases**: Mathematics demands critical thinking to identify hidden assumptions and consider all edge cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. A seemingly straightforward diagram can conceal critical geometric relationships that invalidate a proof, as demonstrated by the triangle example where the intersection point's position is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

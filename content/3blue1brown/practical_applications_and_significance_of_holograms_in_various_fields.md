The concept of holography allows for a special kind of recording on film that creates the illusion of looking through a window into a recorded scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. This phenomenon has practical applications beyond its artistic appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:51:00">[36:51:00]</a>.

## Historical Context of Significance
The underlying principle of holography was discovered by [[historical_background_and_development_of_holography | Dennis Gabor]] in 1947 while he was researching methods for electron microscopy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. Decades later, with the invention of lasers, holography became practical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. Gabor was awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery in 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>, underscoring its significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:51:00">[36:51:00]</a>. For those interested in the [[historical_background_and_development_of_holography | history and development of holography and physics]], [[historical_background_and_development_of_holography | Gabor's Nobel Prize lecture]] is a recommended resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:40:00">[37:40:00]</a>.

## Practical Applications

### Measurement of Tiny Shifts
Holograms can be used to measure extremely tiny shifts in an object's position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:17:00">[37:17:00]</a>. When an original scene is superimposed with its freshly recorded hologram, dark stripes become visible on the object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:59:00">[36:59:00]</a>. These stripes arise from the minute positional shifts, affecting how the light interferes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:13:00">[37:13:00]</a>. By analyzing these patterns, the size of such shifts can be precisely measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:17:00">[37:17:00]</a>.

### Interferometry
The ability to measure tiny distances with holograms is directly relevant to [[scientific_principles_behind_holography_including_light_waves_and_interference | interferometry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:21:00">[37:21:00]</a>. [[scientific_principles_behind_holography_including_light_waves_and_interference | Interferometry]] is a technique that uses wave interference to measure extremely small distances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:26:00">[37:26:00]</a>. Holography provides a valuable tool for this field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:32:00">[37:32:00]</a>.

### General Experimental Tool
More broadly, the capacity to record and reproduce an entire wavefront of light makes holography a useful tool for a variety of experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:32:00">[37:32:00]</a>. This capability allows for the perfect recreation of complex optical effects within a scene, such as how light from objects is bent and distorted when passing through glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:54:00">[34:54:00]</a>.

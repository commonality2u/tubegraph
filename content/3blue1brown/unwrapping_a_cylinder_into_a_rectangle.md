Unwrapping a cylinder into a rectangle is a conceptual method used to understand and calculate the surface area of a cylinder, and by extension, the surface area of a sphere via [[comparing_sphere_surface_area_with_cylinder_surface_area | Archimedes' proof]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Archimedes' Proof and Cylinder Surface Area

The surface area of a sphere with radius *r* is 4πr² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A beautiful proof by Archimedes demonstrates that this surface area is identical to the surface area of a cylinder that perfectly encloses the sphere, provided the circular caps of the cylinder are disregarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

This proof involves projecting small rectangular patches from the sphere onto the surrounding cylinder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Although the projection involves stretching in one direction and squishing in another, these effects cancel out perfectly when the [[geometric_analysis_of_sphere_and_cylinder | relevant geometry]] is analyzed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. By treating the sphere as a sum of these small patches and the cylinder as a sum of their shadows, it's inferred that the surface area of the sphere equals the area of the cylinder's lateral surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## The Unwrapping Process

The lateral surface of a cylinder can be conceptually "unwrapped" or unrolled into a flat rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
The dimensions of this resulting rectangle are:
*   One side length corresponds to the circumference of the cylinder's base, which is 2πr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   The other side length corresponds to the height of the cylinder. For a cylinder enclosing a sphere, this height is equal to the diameter of the sphere, which is 2r <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

Multiplying these dimensions yields the area:
Area = (2πr) × (2r) = 4πr² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

This calculation confirms that the surface area of the sphere is indeed 4πr², exactly four times the area of a circle with the same radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Analogy to Circle Area

This unwrapping method can be compared to the trick for calculating a circle's area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. A circle can be conceptually unwrapped into a triangle with a height equal to the radius (*r*) and a base equal to its circumference (2πr) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Four of these "unwrapped" circles would fit perfectly into the rectangle formed by unwrapping the cylinder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

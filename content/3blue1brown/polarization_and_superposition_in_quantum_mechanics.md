To understand [[quantum_mechanics_basics_for_beginners|quantum mechanics]] more deeply, especially its foundations, it is useful to begin with light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. Specifically, understanding waves and their mathematical description is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. Many concepts of [[quantum_mechanics_basics_for_beginners|quantum mechanics]], such as describing states as [[concept_of_duality_in_math|superpositions]] with various amplitudes and phases, are found in classical wave mechanics without the associated "quantum weirdness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. This approach helps appreciate the actual differences in [[quantum_mechanics_basics_for_beginners|quantum mechanics]], such as restrictions on wave energy, measurement behavior, and quantum entanglement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

## Classical Description of Light

The late 1800s understanding described light as waves in the electromagnetic field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

### Electric and Magnetic Fields
*   The electric field is a vector field where arrows at each point in space indicate the direction and strength of the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. A charged particle in this field experiences a force in the direction of the arrow, proportional to the arrow's length and the particle's charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.
*   The magnetic field is also a vector field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. For a charged particle moving through it, the force is perpendicular to both its direction of motion and the magnetic field's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. This force is proportional to the particle's charge, velocity, and the magnetic field arrow's length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

### Maxwell's Equations and Electromagnetic Waves
Maxwell's equations, a culmination of 19th-century physics, describe how the electric and magnetic fields interact and cause changes to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. For instance, a loop in the electric field corresponds to an increasing magnetic field, and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. This mutual interplay results in propagating waves where the electric and magnetic fields oscillate perpendicularly to each other and to the direction of propagation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. These propagating waves are known as electromagnetic radiation, encompassing phenomena like radio waves and visible light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. The understanding that light is an electromagnetic wave was surprising in Maxwell's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

### Mathematical Description of Waves
Ideas core to [[quantum_mechanics_basics_for_beginners|quantum mechanics]], such as [[concept_of_duality_in_math|superposition]], amplitudes, and phases, arise naturally in the classical description of waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

For a wave directed out of the screen, focusing only on the electric field oscillating in the xy-plane:
*   **Polarization**: If the electric field oscillates horizontally, the light is horizontally polarized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. Its x-component might be described as `a * cosine(2πft + φ)`, where 'a' is the amplitude, 'f' is the frequency, 't' is time, and 'φ' is the phase shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.
*   **Kets**: In a similar notation to [[quantum_mechanics_basics_for_begginers|quantum mechanics]], unit vectors for horizontal and vertical directions can be represented using kets (e.g., `|horizontal⟩` and `|vertical⟩`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.
*   **[[concept_of_duality_in_math|Superposition]]**: If two distinct waves satisfy Maxwell's equations (in a vacuum), their sum also forms a valid wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. This is because Maxwell's equations in a vacuum are linear equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>. The new wave is a [[concept_of_duality_in_math|superposition]] of the initial waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. The phase difference between components affects the resulting wave; for example, a 90-degree phase shift with equal amplitudes leads to circularly polarized light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>.
*   **Basis**: Waves can be described as a [[concept_of_duality_in_math|superposition]] of different sets of directions, called a basis (e.g., horizontal/vertical or diagonal/anti-diagonal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. The choice of basis depends on the application, such as analyzing light passing through a polarizing filter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.
*   **Classical Energy**: Classically, the energy of a wave is proportional to the square of its amplitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>. For a [[concept_of_duality_in_math|superposition]] of horizontal (Ax) and vertical (Ay) components, the energy density is proportional to Ax² + Ay², aligning with the Pythagorean theorem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>. This implies energy can be dialed up or down continuously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>.

## Quantum Light: Photons and Probabilities

In contrast to classical understanding, physicists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries observed that energy comes in discrete amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>.

### Quantization of Energy
The energy of an electromagnetic wave always appears as an integer multiple of Planck's constant (h) times the frequency (f), or E = nhf, where n is an integer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>. This means there is a minimal non-zero energy level for waves of a given frequency (hf) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>. An electromagnetic wave with this minimal energy is called a **photon** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>. This is unusual because classical waves are perceived as continuously oscillating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>.

### Quantum Superposition and Measurement
The mathematical description of classical electromagnetic waves, including [[concept_of_duality_in_math|superposition]], amplitude, and phase, carries over to describing a photon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>.
*   For example, a 45-degree diagonally polarized photon can be described as a [[concept_of_duality_in_math|superposition]] of horizontal and vertical states, each with an amplitude and phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>.
*   However, the interpretation differs: the squares of the amplitudes of each component no longer represent the continuous energy amount in each direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>. Instead, for quantized light at its minimal non-zero energy level, the squares of those amplitudes tell you the **probabilities** that a given photon will be found to have all of its energy in one direction or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:50:00">[18:50:00]</a>.

### Experimental Evidence and State Collapse
When a diagonally polarized photon is shot at a vertically oriented polarizing filter:
*   Classically, half its energy (the horizontal component) would be absorbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00">[14:37:00]</a>.
*   Quantically, because energy comes in indivisible photon packets, it must either pass through with all its energy or be entirely absorbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>.
*   In experiments, about half the time the photon passes through entirely, and about half the time it is entirely absorbed, seemingly at random <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a>.
*   If a photon passes through, the measurement forces it to change its polarization to align with the filter's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>. This is analogous to [[schrodingers_equation_and_quantum_mechanics|Schrödinger's cat]]: a [[concept_of_duality_in_math|superposition]] collapses into one definite state upon measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>.

An example demonstrating this phenomenon involves three polarizing filters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:40:00">[15:40:00]</a>:
1.  Two filters rotated 90 degrees off from each other block light completely (e.g., vertical then horizontal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>. Photons passing the first filter have a 0% chance of passing the second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>.
2.  Inserting a third filter at a 45-degree angle between the first two allows more light through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10:00">[16:10:00]</a>.
3.  Photons passing the first (vertical) filter have a 50% chance of passing the diagonal filter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>. If they pass, their polarization changes to diagonal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:23:00">[16:23:00]</a>. From this diagonal state, they then have a 50% chance of passing the final (horizontal) filter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a>. This results in 25% of the original photons passing all three filters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:44:00">[16:44:00]</a>, something unexplainable without the middle filter forcing state changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:00">[16:49:00]</a>.

For a photon with 22.5-degree polarization (relative to a filter):
*   Classically, its horizontal component would have an amplitude of sin(22.5°) ≈ 0.38, and its vertical component an amplitude of cos(22.5°) ≈ 0.92 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20:00">[17:20:00]</a>. This would imply 0.38² ≈ 15% of energy in the horizontal direction and 0.92² ≈ 85% in the vertical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:41:00">[17:41:00]</a>.
*   Quantically, if passed through a vertical filter, 85% of the time the photon passes entirely, and 15% of the time it is completely blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:07:00">[18:07:00]</a>.

### Wave-Particle Duality and Complex Numbers
The wave equations themselves don't change in [[quantum_mechanics_basics_for_beginners|quantum mechanics]]; photons are still described as a [[concept_of_duality_in_math|superposition]] of oscillating components with amplitude and phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:25:00">[18:25:00]</a>. These components are often encoded using a single complex number, which conveniently encapsulates both amplitude and phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>. This use of complex numbers stems from the underlying wavy nature of quantum objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.

While photons represent the quantization of waves, the [[waveparticle_duality_and_de_broglie_hypothesis|wave-particle duality]] also applies to particles like electrons, which were originally understood as discrete packets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:42:00">[19:42:00]</a>. In more general cases beyond single-photon polarization, [[quantum_mechanics_basics_for_beginners|quantum mechanical]] states are described as [[concept_of_duality_in_math|superpositions]] of multiple base states, the choice of which depends on the basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:52:00">[19:52:00]</a>. Each component has an amplitude and phase (often a complex number), and the square of the amplitude determines the probability of measuring a particle in that base state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:03:00">[20:03:00]</a>. If the wavy nature of particles had been discovered first, the field might have been called "harmonic mechanics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">[20:25:00]</a>.

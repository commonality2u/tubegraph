When first encountering the [[Pythagorean theorem | Pythagorean theorem]], it's common to become familiar with examples like the 3-4-5 or 5-12-13 triangles, where the sum of two perfect squares equals a perfect square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. These sets of whole numbers (a, b, c) where a² + b² = c² are known as Pythagorean triples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

[[Fermat's Last Theorem]] addresses a similar equation, but with a different exponent. It states that if the exponent in the equation aⁿ + bⁿ = cⁿ is any whole number greater than 2, there are no integer solutions for a, b, and c <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This means that for n=3, 4, 5, and so on, equations like a³ + b³ = c³ have no non-trivial integer solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

Newton's fractals are an infinite family of intricate shapes that exhibit infinite detail regardless of how far one zooms in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. While visually striking, these fractals originate from a pragmatic problem: finding the roots of polynomials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## The Practical Need for Root Finding

The question of finding when a polynomial equals zero, also known as finding its "roots," is common in engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. For instance, in computer graphics, polynomials are extensively used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. When a computer renders text, fonts are often defined by [[Bezier curves]], which are polynomial curves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Determining whether a pixel should be colored for a curve's stroke width or fill involves understanding its distance from the mathematical curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This distance squared is itself a polynomial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Finding the minimum of this distance (a classic calculus problem) requires finding when its derivative (also a polynomial) equals zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

For quadratic functions, the quadratic formula provides an exact solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This formula was estimated to be used trillions of times in the production of the movie *Coco* due to its extensive use of polynomially defined elements like spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. While formulas exist for cubic and quartic polynomials, they become increasingly complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. However, for polynomials of degree 5 or more (quintic and higher), there is no analogous formula that can solve them using standard functions, a concept known as the unsolvability of the quintic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. In practice, algorithms are used to approximate solutions with high precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

## Newton's Method: The Algorithm

A common and widely used algorithm for approximating polynomial roots is [[Newtons Fractal and Rational Functions | Newton's method]], also known as the Newton-Raphson method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

The procedure is as follows:
1.  **Initial Guess**: Start with an arbitrary initial guess, `x0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
2.  **Linear Approximation**: At `x0`, compute the value of the polynomial `p(x0)` and its derivative `p'(x0)` (the slope of the tangent line) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
3.  **Next Guess**: Determine where the tangent line crosses the x-axis. This point becomes the next guess, `x1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. The step size can be calculated as `p(x) / p'(x)`, so the next guess `x1` is `x0 - p(x0) / p'(x0)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
4.  **Iteration**: Repeat the process with the new guess. Each iteration typically brings the guess closer to a true root <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

However, Newton's method is not without its "foibles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. If an initial guess is far from a root, the sequence of new guesses can bounce around chaotically, potentially failing to converge to a nearby root or taking many iterations to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

## Newton's Fractals in the Complex Plane

The true complexity of Newton's method emerges when considering roots in the complex plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. According to the fundamental theorem of algebra, a polynomial of degree *n* will always have exactly *n* roots in the complex plane (counting multiplicity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

While the visual analogy of tangent lines on a graph doesn't apply to complex numbers, the mathematical formula for Newton's method remains valid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. By selecting a grid of initial guesses in the complex plane and applying Newton's method, most points quickly converge to one of the polynomial's true roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

To visualize this, each initial guess (pixel) is colored based on which root it ultimately converges to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. The resulting image, known as a [[Newtons fractals in the complex plane and resulting patterns | Newton's fractal]], reveals an astonishing level of detail and complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Even minute changes to the initial seed value can lead to convergence on a completely different root, highlighting the unpredictable nature of the algorithm in certain regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

The appearance of the [[Newtons fractals in the complex plane and resulting patterns | fractal pattern]] changes with the polynomial's roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. Regions close to a specific root tend to converge to that root, appearing as solid color patches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. The chaos and intricate detail are concentrated at the boundaries between these regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. The true fractal image is the limit as an arbitrarily large number of iterations are allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

Interestingly, if only zero steps of Newton's method are taken, the image is a Voronoi Diagram, where each point is colored based on the closest root <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. As more steps are allowed, the pattern becomes increasingly intricate, leading to the complex fractal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

## Why the Complexity?

The seemingly simple iterative process of Newton's method producing such endless complexity is a profound question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. It's not related to the [[finite and infinite mathematical constructs | unsolvability of the quintic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

For polynomials with three or more roots, a [[understanding_fractals_and_their_definitions | fractal pattern]] emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. However, for quadratic polynomials (with only two roots), each initial guess tends toward whichever root it's closest to, resulting in a much simpler, non-fractal boundary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. This suggests a critical change occurs when moving from two to three roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

### The Bizarre Boundary Property

The complexity arises from a peculiar property: the boundary of any one color region in a Newton's fractal is precisely the same as the boundary of *all* other color regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

A point is on the boundary of a set if any small circle centered at that point contains points both inside and outside the set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. The property implies that any sufficiently small circle will either contain only points tending to one root (if it's in the interior of a region) or points tending to *all* of the roots (if it contains the shared boundary) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. It's impossible for a circle to contain just two colors, as that would mean a boundary exists between only two regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

This property necessitates that the boundaries are not smooth but consist entirely of "sharp corners," explaining why they remain rough and intricate no matter how far one zooms in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>. For a given cubic polynomial, the [[Fractal Dimension and Its Application in Nature | fractal dimension]] of its boundary can be measured, for example, around 1.44 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.

In essence, if an initial guess is near a sensitive point on the boundary, where slight adjustments could lead to different roots, then *every* possible root must be accessible from within that tiny neighborhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. This explains why the "blobs on blobs on blobs" pattern is observed in the fractal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.

The study of such phenomena falls under the field of mathematics known as holomorphic dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>. The fact that simple ideas, like Newton's method from centuries ago, can hold hidden complexities like Newton's fractals, speaks to the potential for new discoveries in seemingly "old news" mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. This area of inquiry can also lead to surprising connections, such as with the Mandelbrot set, if one explores the possibility of points getting trapped in cycles during the iteration process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.

Early astronomical theories often sought elegant, geometric explanations for the cosmos. One prominent example is Johannes Kepler's initial attempt to prove the most elegant theory in astronomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## [[Keplers geometric theory of planetary orbits | Kepler's Geometric Theory of Planetary Orbits]]

Kepler's theory proposed a nested model of spheres and Platonic solids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>:
*   Imagine a sphere inscribed within an octahedron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.
*   Fit the smallest possible sphere around that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.
*   Then, fit the smallest possible icosahedron around that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
*   Layer on another sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   Add a dodecahedron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   Follow with one more sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   Then, a tetrahedron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   One more sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   A cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   And finally, one last sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

This arrangement resulted in six spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Kepler believed that the ratios between the sizes of these six spheres would match the ratios of the orbits for the six known planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The use of Platonic solids made this feel like a natural or universal set of ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### Testing the Theory

Kepler eventually obtained orbital data to try and confirm his theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Despite a "heroic" effort in his methodology, the theory did not fit the observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. It was consistently off by a few percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Shift Towards Observational Laws

Although Kepler started with a premise that proved incorrect, this process ultimately led him to be the first person to understand how planets actually move around the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This foundational work paved the way for the [[Development of Keplers laws of motion | development of his famous laws of planetary motion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

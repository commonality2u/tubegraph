The core building block of linear algebra is the [[understanding_vectors_in_linear_algebra | vector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Understanding [[different_perspectives_on_vectors | vectors]] from different [[different_perspectives_on_vectors | perspectives]] is crucial for their application in fields such as data analysis and computer graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Vectors in Data Analysis (Computer Science Perspective)

From a computer science student's [[different_perspectives_on_vectors | perspective]], [[understanding_vectors_in_linear_algebra | vectors]] are understood as ordered lists of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. In this context, the term "[[understanding_vectors_in_linear_algebra | vector]]" is essentially a sophisticated term for a list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### Example: House Price Analytics
When performing analytics on house prices, where features like square footage and price are considered, each house can be modeled as a pair of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The first number could represent square footage, and the second, price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The order of these numbers matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. In this scenario, houses are modeled as [[vectors_in_two_and_three_dimensions | two-dimensional]] [[understanding_vectors_in_linear_algebra | vectors]], with the "[[vectors_in_two_and_three_dimensions | two-dimensional]]" aspect referring to the length of the list being two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### Benefits for Data Analysts
Linear algebra offers data analysts a valuable way to visualize and conceptualize multiple lists of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This visual approach can significantly clarify patterns within data and provide a comprehensive understanding of the effects of various operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

## Vectors in Computer Graphics

For computer graphics programmers, linear algebra provides a language to describe space and its manipulation using numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. These numerical representations can then be processed and run through a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

### Example: Mathematical Animations
When creating mathematical animations, the process typically involves first considering the geometric movements and transformations in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. This spatial understanding is then translated into numerical representations for the computer to determine pixel placement on the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This entire process heavily relies on a strong understanding of linear algebra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

## The Interplay of Perspectives

The utility of linear algebra stems less from adhering to a single [[different_perspectives_on_vectors | perspective]] (e.g., [[understanding_vectors_in_linear_algebra | vectors]] as arrows in space vs. lists of numbers) and more from the ability to seamlessly translate between these [[different_perspectives_on_vectors | views]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This flexibility allows for both visual conceptualization of data and numerical manipulation of spatial descriptions.

[[what_bitcoin_is_and_how_it_functions_as_a_digital_currency | Bitcoin]] was the first implemented example of a [[blockchain_technology_and_its_application_in_cryptocurrency_transactions | cryptocurrency]], a fully digital currency not issued by a government or managed by banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Cryptocurrencies aim to circumvent the need for trust in traditional financial systems by using ideas from [[digital_signatures_and_cryptography | cryptography]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

At its core, a [[what_bitcoin_is_and_how_it_functions_as_a_digital_currency | cryptocurrency]] like [[what_bitcoin_is_and_how_it_functions_as_a_digital_currency | Bitcoin]] is a [[the_role_of_ledgers_digital_signatures_and_hash_functions_in_bitcoin | ledger]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>. The history of transactions recorded on this [[the_role_of_ledgers_digital_signatures_and_hash_functions_in_bitcoin | ledger]] constitutes the currency itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>. Instead of a central bank verifying transactions, the system relies on a clever, decentralized, trustless verification method based on mathematical [[digital_signatures_and_cryptography | cryptography]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

## Components of Trustless Verification

### Decentralized Ledger System
To avoid trusting a central location, such as a website host, everyone maintains their own copy of the [[the_role_of_ledgers_digital_signatures_and_hash_functions_in_bitcoin | ledger]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>. When a transaction is made, it is broadcast to the world for others to record on their personal [[the_role_of_ledgers_digital_signatures_and_hash_functions_in_bitcoin | ledgers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. The central challenge in such a distributed system is to achieve consensus on what the correct [[the_role_of_ledgers_digital_signatures_and_hash_functions_in_bitcoin | ledger]] is and the order of transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>.

### [[digital_signatures_and_cryptography | Digital Signatures]]
The first layer of trustless verification involves [[digital_signatures_and_cryptography | digital signatures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. These allow a sender to prove they approved a transaction, making it infeasible for others to forge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

-   **Public Key-Private Key Pair**: Each participant generates a public key (PK) and a private key (SK) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. The private key must be kept secret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
-   **Signature Generation**: A [[digital_signatures_and_cryptography | digital signature]] is a string of 1s and 0s (commonly [[256_bit_security_concept | 256 bits]]) that changes completely even with slight alterations to the message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. It is produced by a function depending on both the message and the private key, ensuring only the owner can create it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.
-   **Signature Verification**: A second function, using the public key, verifies if a signature is valid for a given message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. It is computationally infeasible to find a valid signature without knowing the secret key, making forgery nearly impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. There are 2^[[256_bit_security_concept | 256]] possible signatures of that length, an astronomically large number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.
-   **Preventing Double-Spending**: To prevent copying valid message-signature combinations, each transaction message includes a unique ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. This requires a new signature for each identical transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.
-   **Transaction Validity**: A transaction is only considered valid if the sender has sufficient funds recorded in the full history of the [[the_role_of_ledgers_digital_signatures_and_hash_functions_in_bitcoin | ledger]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.

### [[the_role_of_ledgers_digital_signatures_and_hash_functions_in_bitcoin | Cryptographic Hash Functions]]
[[what_bitcoin_is_and_how_it_functions_as_a_digital_currency | Bitcoin]]'s solution to achieving consensus in a distributed [[the_role_of_ledgers_digital_signatures_and_hash_functions_in_bitcoin | ledger]] is to trust the [[the_role_of_ledgers_digital_signatures_and_hash_functions_in_bitcoin | ledger]] that has the most computational work put into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>. This involves [[the_role_of_ledgers_digital_signatures_and_hash_functions_in_bitcoin | cryptographic hash functions]], such as SHA256 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>.

-   **Properties**: A [[the_role_of_ledgers_digital_signatures_and_hash_functions_in_bitcoin | hash function]] takes any message or file as input and produces a fixed-length string of bits (e.g., [[256_bit_security_concept | 256 bits]]) called a hash or digest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>.
-   **Unpredictability**: Even a slight change in the input completely changes the resulting hash, and this change is entirely unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>.
-   **One-way Function**: It is infeasible to compute a [[the_role_of_ledgers_digital_signatures_and_hash_functions_in_bitcoin | hash function]] in reverse; finding an input that produces a specific hash requires guessing and checking, making it computationally intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>. This property is fundamental to modern security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>.

### [[mining_and_the_proof_of_work_concept_in_the_bitcoin_protocol | Proof of Work]]
A [[mining_and_the_proof_of_work_concept_in_the_bitcoin_protocol | Proof of Work]] demonstrates that a significant amount of computational effort has been expended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>. For example, finding a "special number" that, when appended to a list of transactions, makes the SHA256 hash of the entire thing start with a specific number of zeros (e.g., 30 zeros) requires a vast number of guesses (about 1 billion for 30 zeros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42:00">[14:42:00]</a>. This work is easy to verify but hard to produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:23:00">[15:23:00]</a>. Critically, this work is intrinsically tied to the specific list of transactions; any alteration requires redoing all the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:00">[15:39:00]</a>.

### [[blockchain_technology_and_its_application_in_cryptocurrency_transactions | Blockchain]] Structure
The [[the_role_of_ledgers_digital_signatures_and_hash_functions_in_bitcoin | ledger]] is organized into "blocks," each containing a list of transactions and its own [[mining_and_the_proof_of_work_concept_in_the_bitcoin_protocol | Proof of Work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>. To ensure a standard order and immutability, each block must include the hash of the previous block in its header <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:00">[16:50:00]</a>. This chaining mechanism makes it a [[blockchain_technology_and_its_application_in_cryptocurrency_transactions | blockchain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:00]</a>. Altering any block or its order would change its hash, breaking the chain and requiring all subsequent blocks to be re-mined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00:00">[17:00:00]</a>.

### [[mining_and_the_proof_of_work_concept_in_the_bitcoin_protocol | Mining]]
"Block creators" (miners) listen for broadcast transactions, collect them into a block, and then perform the [[mining_and_the_proof_of_work_concept_in_the_bitcoin_protocol | Proof of Work]] to find the special number that makes the block's hash meet the required criteria (e.g., starting with many zeros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:00">[17:35:00]</a>. Once found, the block is broadcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:46:00">[17:46:00]</a>. This process is called [[mining_and_the_proof_of_work_concept_in_the_bitcoin_protocol | mining]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:00">[18:20:00]</a>.

-   **Block Reward**: To incentivize [[mining_and_the_proof_of_work_concept_in_the_bitcoin_protocol | mining]], a special transaction is included at the top of each new block, granting the miner a "block reward" (e.g., 10 ledger dollars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:55:00">[17:55:00]</a>. This is how new currency enters the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:13:00">[18:13:00]</a>.
-   **Transaction Fees**: Users can optionally include a transaction fee with their payment, which goes to the miner who includes that transaction in their block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:00">[23:13:00]</a>. This incentivizes miners to prioritize transactions, especially in systems with block size limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:29:00">[23:29:00]</a>.

### Decentralized Consensus
The core of the [[what_bitcoin_is_and_how_it_functions_as_a_digital_currency | Bitcoin]] protocol is that if a participant hears two conflicting [[blockchain_technology_and_its_application_in_cryptocurrency_transactions | blockchains]], they defer to the longest oneâ€”the one with the most cumulative computational work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:00">[19:10:00]</a>. This mechanism allows for decentralized consensus without a central authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:00">[19:28:00]</a>.

-   **Security Against Fraud**: To fool someone with a fraudulent block, an attacker would need to consistently find valid [[mining_and_the_proof_of_work_concept_in_the_bitcoin_protocol | Proof of Work]] before the rest of the network combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:11:00">[20:11:00]</a>. Unless the attacker controls close to 50% of the network's total computing resources, the legitimate [[blockchain_technology_and_its_application_in_cryptocurrency_transactions | blockchain]] will almost certainly grow faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:58:00">[20:58:00]</a>.
-   **Trusting Payments**: For a payment to be considered trustworthy, a user should wait for several new blocks to be added on top of the block containing their transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:23:00">[21:23:00]</a>. This ensures the transaction is deeply embedded in the longest chain that everyone else is using <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:36:00">[21:36:00]</a>.

## [[what_bitcoin_is_and_how_it_functions_as_a_digital_currency | Bitcoin]] Specifics
-   **Block Time**: The [[what_bitcoin_is_and_how_it_functions_as_a_digital_currency | Bitcoin]] protocol periodically adjusts the difficulty of the [[mining_and_the_proof_of_work_concept_in_the_bitcoin_protocol | Proof of Work]] (the number of leading zeros required) to ensure that a new block is found, on average, every 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:03:00">[22:03:00]</a>.
-   **Reward Halving**: The block reward, initially 50 [[what_bitcoin_is_and_how_it_functions_as_a_digital_currency | Bitcoin]] per block, is cut in half every 210,000 blocks (approximately every 4 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:49:00">[22:49:00]</a>. Currently, it is 12.5 [[what_bitcoin_is_and_how_it_functions_as_a_digital_currency | Bitcoin]] per block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:56:00">[22:56:00]</a>.
-   **Limited Supply**: Due to the geometrically decreasing block reward, there will never be more than 21 million [[what_bitcoin_is_and_how_it_functions_as_a_digital_currency | Bitcoin]] in existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:00">[23:00:00]</a>.
-   **Transaction Throughput**: [[what_bitcoin_is_and_how_it_functions_as_a_digital_currency | Bitcoin]] blocks are limited to about 2400 transactions, leading to slower processing compared to traditional systems like Visa (1700 transactions per second average) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:00">[23:36:00]</a>. This can result in higher transaction fees as miners prioritize transactions with higher fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:56:00">[23:56:00]</a>.

Understanding these principles provides a foundational understanding of the underlying technology of [[what_bitcoin_is_and_how_it_functions_as_a_digital_currency | Bitcoin]] and other cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:35:00">[24:35:00]</a>.

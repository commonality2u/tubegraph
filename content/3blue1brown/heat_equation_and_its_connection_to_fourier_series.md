The [[fourier_series_in_solving_heat_equations | Fourier series]], particularly in its complex form, involves a collection of vectors, each rotating at a constant integer frequency. When these vectors are added together tip-to-tail, their final tip draws out a specific shape over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. By adjusting the initial size and angle of each vector, it's possible to draw virtually any desired shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

This concept demonstrates how simple individual actions (steady rotation) can lead to complex collective behavior, yet this complexity is fully describable and controllable mathematically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The underlying formula for this is remarkably concise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Historical Context: Fourier and the Heat Equation

Historically, [[fourier_series_in_solving_heat_equations | Fourier series]] are often described as sums of [[role_of_sine_and_cosine_waves_in_heat_equation_solutions | sine waves]] that break down functions of real numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This perspective is where Fourier himself began his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Fourier developed his significant ideas while working on the [[the_heat_equation_and_its_applications | heat equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Understanding the physics problem that motivated this math reveals the unexpectedly far-reaching nature of [[fourier_series_in_solving_heat_equations | Fourier series]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### The Heat Equation

The [[the_heat_equation_and_its_applications | heat equation]] describes how the temperature distribution on a rod evolves over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. It also applies to many other phenomena beyond heat transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Directly using this equation to predict the evolution of an arbitrary heat distribution is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Simple Solutions

A simple solution to the [[the_heat_equation_and_its_applications | heat equation]] exists if the initial temperature distribution resembles a [[role_of_sine_and_cosine_waves_in_heat_equation_solutions | cosine wave]], with its frequency tuned so that it remains flat at each end point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Over time, these waves simply scale down exponentially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, with higher frequency waves decaying at a faster rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Linearity of the Heat Equation

The [[the_heat_equation_and_its_applications | heat equation]] is a linear equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This means that if you have two solutions, their sum is also a new solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. You can also scale each solution by a constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, allowing the construction of custom functions that solve the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

This property is crucial because it allows for the combination of an infinite family of solutions (the exponentially decaying [[role_of_sine_and_cosine_waves_in_heat_equation_solutions | cosine waves]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. By scaling and combining a few of these, a solution can be derived for a new, tailor-made initial condition that is a combination of [[role_of_sine_and_cosine_waves_in_heat_equation_solutions | cosine waves]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. When these waves are combined, the higher frequency components decay faster, causing the sum to smooth out over time as those terms quickly diminish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This difference in decay rates for different pure frequency components captures the complexity in the evolution of the heat distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## Fourier's Bold Question: Representing Any Function

While it seemed intuitive to solve the [[the_heat_equation_and_its_applications | heat equation]] for wave-like initial distributions, Fourier's genius lay in asking an "absurd" question: how can *any* initial distribution, even a discontinuous one like a step function (representing two rods at different uniform temperatures coming into contact), be expressed as a sum of [[role_of_sine_and_cosine_waves_in_heat_equation_solutions | sine waves]]? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

This question was particularly bold because it required restricting the sum to waves satisfying specific boundary conditions, meaning the frequencies of the [[role_of_sine_and_cosine_waves_in_heat_equation_solutions | cosine functions]] must be whole number multiples of a base frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. For different boundary conditions (e.g., fixed endpoints), a different set of waves (like sine functions) would be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

This idea of breaking down functions and patterns into combinations of simple oscillations is what made Fourier immortal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Its importance extends far beyond Fourier's initial imagination, even though its origin is in physics seemingly unrelated to frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### Infinite Sums and Discontinuities

Finite sums of [[role_of_sine_and_cosine_waves_in_heat_equation_solutions | sine waves]] can only approximate functions that are perfectly flat or discontinuous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Fourier considered infinite sums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. For the step function (e.g., temperature of 1 degree for left rod, -1 degree for right rod), it can be represented by an infinite sum with specific coefficients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

An "infinite sum" means that a sequence of partial sums approaches a specific value in the limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. For functions, this applies to many values in parallel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. For example, for the step function, the sum approaches 1 for inputs less than 0.5, and -1 for inputs greater than 0.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. At the point of discontinuity (e.g., 0.5), the sum evaluates to 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. This means an infinite sum of continuous, wavy functions can result in a discontinuous, flat function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, allowing for qualitative changes that finite sums cannot achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

When these infinite sums of [[the_heat_equation_and_its_applications | heat equation]] solutions associated with [[role_of_sine_and_cosine_waves_in_heat_equation_solutions | cosine waves]] are combined, they provide an exact solution for how a discontinuous initial condition like a step function evolves over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

## Generalizing to Complex Fourier Series and Rotating Vectors

While Fourier initially worked with real numbers, a more general approach involves functions whose outputs can be any [[application_of_complex_numbers_and_exponentials_in_fourier_series | complex number]] in the 2D plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. This brings the [[fourier_series_and_rotating_vectors | rotating vectors]] from the opening animation back into play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. This broader view simplifies computations and better illustrates why they work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. It also lays a foundation for future concepts like the [[introduction_to_fourier_transform | Laplace transform]] and the importance of exponential functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

Functions with real number outputs (like temperature functions) are considered "boring drawings" confined to one dimension in this framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. When a real-valued function is decomposed into [[fourier_series_and_rotating_vectors | rotating vectors]], vectors with opposite frequencies (e.g., +1 and -1) will have the same length and be horizontal reflections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Their sum oscillates on the real number line, behaving like a [[role_of_sine_and_cosine_waves_in_heat_equation_solutions | sine wave]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Thus, the original [[fourier_series_in_solving_heat_equations | Fourier series]] context of breaking down real-valued functions into [[role_of_sine_and_cosine_waves_in_heat_equation_solutions | sine waves]] is a special case of the more general concept of 2D drawings and [[fourier_series_and_rotating_vectors | rotating vectors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

### The Role of Complex Exponentials

The "heart and soul" of [[fourier_series_in_solving_heat_equations | Fourier series]] is the [[application_of_complex_numbers_and_exponentials_in_fourier_series | complex exponential]], specifically `e^(i * t)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. As the input `t` progresses, this value traces a path around the unit circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. The [[connection_between_fourier_series_and_differential_equations | connection between Fourier series and differential equations]] becomes clearer through the perspective of [[role_of_derivatives_in_the_heat_equation | differential equations]] and why exponentiating imaginary numbers results in circular motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. While the concept could be described purely with vectors, including `e^(i*t)` authentically reflects why this idea is so useful for solving [[role_of_derivatives_in the_heat_equation | differential equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. For now, `e^(i*t)` can be seen as a shorthand for [[fourier_series_and_rotating_vectors | rotating vectors]], but it holds deeper significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

Each [[fourier_series_and_rotating_vectors | rotating vector]] in the complex Fourier series can be represented by `c_n * e^(n * 2π * i * t)`, where `c_n` is a complex constant determining its initial size and angle, and `n` is an integer representing its frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. The constant vector (frequency 0) is `c_0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

### Calculating Fourier Coefficients

The challenge is to find these `c_n` coefficients for any arbitrary function `f(t)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. The constant term, `c_0`, represents the center of mass or average of the drawing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. It can be found by integrating `f(t)` over the interval (e.g., from 0 to 1), which essentially computes the continuous average of the function's outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

The average of a sum is the sum of the averages of its parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. When taking the average of all rotating vector components over a full cycle (e.g., `t` from 0 to 1), most vectors average out to zero because they make a whole number of rotations around the origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>. The only exception is the constant term (`c_0`), whose average is just `c_0` itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. Thus, integrating `f(t)` cleverly isolates `c_0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

To find any other coefficient, `c_n`, the trick is to multiply `f(t)` by `e^(-n * 2π * i * t)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. This multiplication shifts the frequency term in each exponent, effectively making the *n*th vector (the one associated with `c_n`) "hold still" (its frequency becomes 0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. All other vectors will then rotate by some non-zero integer frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. Taking the average (integral) of this modified function will cause all the rotating terms to average out to zero, leaving only `c_n` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>. This yields a general formula for `c_n` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>:

$$c_n = \int_{0}^{1} f(t) \cdot e^{-n \cdot 2\pi i t} dt$$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>

This expression means modifying the function so that the desired *n*th vector is still, and then averaging to eliminate all moving vectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

### Application to the Step Function

Revisiting the step function, which models heat dissipation between two rods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>, it is a "boring drawing" confined to one dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. The [[fourier_series_in_solving_heat_equations | Fourier series]] approximation for this function will stay close to 1 for the first half of the cycle, then quickly jump to -1 for the second half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>. Each pair of [[fourier_series_and_rotating_vectors | rotating vectors]] moving in opposite directions corresponds to one of the [[role_of_sine_and_cosine_waves_in_heat_equation_solutions | cosine waves]] from the earlier discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. The coefficients for the step function can be found by computing the integral formula above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.

## Broader Significance

The discussion of the [[the_heat_equation_and_its_applications | heat equation]] provides a glimpse into the study of partial [[role_of_derivatives_in_the_heat_equation | differential equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>. The core idea of breaking down a function into a combination of exponential functions and using this decomposition to solve a [[role_of_derivatives_in_the_heat_equation | differential equation]] is a recurring theme in mathematics and physics, especially for linear equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>. This highlights the deep [[connection_between_fourier_series_and_differential_equations | connection between Fourier series and differential equations]] and the general applicability of these mathematical tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.

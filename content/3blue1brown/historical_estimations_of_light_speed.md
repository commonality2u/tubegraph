## Discovery Through Jupiter's Moon Io
The observation of [[ios_orbit_and_light_speed_discovery | Jupiter's moons]], particularly Io, was crucial for one of the most significant discoveries in physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Io regularly enters and exits Jupiter's shadow, becoming dark and then bright again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. By observing Io through a telescope, the exact time it reappeared could be marked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

Initially, these reappearances seemed to occur in precise 42-hour increments, like clockwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. However, it was noticed that this regularity was not constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. At different times of the year, Io would appear either ahead of or behind schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## The Orbital Discrepancy
When Earth was on the same side of the Sun as Jupiter, Io's reappearance was observed to be 20 minutes earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Conversely, when Earth was on the opposite side of Jupiter, it took 20 minutes longer for Io to reappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This constituted a delay in the orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Huygens' Realization
After precise calculations, [[huygens_calculations_on_light_speed | Huygens]] realized the reason for this delay was that light itself was taking time to traverse the changing distance between Earth and Jupiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The "extra distance" light had to travel as Earth moved from one side of its orbit relative to Jupiter to the other was determined to be approximately two [[impact_of_astronomical_units_on_light_speed | astronomical units]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This distance was traversed in about 20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Significance of the Discovery
At the time of this discovery, the true value of an [[impact_of_astronomical_units_on_light_speed | astronomical unit]] was not precisely known, leading to early estimates for the speed of light that might not seem impressive by modern standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Crucially, before this, it was not even widely accepted that light had a finite speed; for most experiments conducted on Earth, light appeared to travel instantaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

This observation demonstrated that at [[distance_measurement_in_the_cosmos | astronomical scales]], light's speed is measurable and not instantaneous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This clever method of measuring light's speed, despite its imprecision, laid the essential groundwork for more accurate experiments conducted on Earth, once a rough sense of light's velocity had been established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

The concept of [[wave_particle_duality_and_de_broglie_hypothesis | wave-particle duality]] and the associated de Broglie hypothesis posits that all matter exhibits wave-like properties, a cornerstone of [[quantum_mechanics_basics_for_beginners | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. This idea helps explain the underlying nature of [[heisenberg_uncertainty_principle_in_quantum_mechanics | Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle]], shifting its interpretation from a statement of unknowability to a fundamental trade-off in wave properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

## Louis de Broglie's Hypothesis

Louis de Broglie, a history major who spent time in radio wave transmissions during WWI, transitioned to physics after the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. In his 1924 PhD thesis, he proposed that all matter has wave-like properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

A crucial aspect of his hypothesis was the conclusion that the momentum of any moving particle is proportional to the *spatial frequency* of that wave, meaning how many times the wave cycles per unit distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

### Intuition from De Broglie's Analogy

De Broglie's reasoning for connecting momentum to spatial frequency can be understood through an analogy involving special relativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. He proposed that if mass is equivalent to energy (via E=mcÂ²) and if that energy is carried as some kind of oscillating phenomenon (like for photons), then relativistic Doppler effects suggest that changes in how that mass moves correspond to changes in its spatial frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

De Broglie described this with a "crude comparison" of many weights hanging from springs, oscillating in sync, with most mass concentrated at a single point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. This energy of oscillating weights metaphors the particle's energy residing in its mass, with the particle dispersed across space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. When viewed from a moving reference frame, these weights appear to fall out of phase, due to the relativistic principle that simultaneous events in one frame may not be simultaneous in another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. This demonstrates how a particle's motion can be related to the spatial frequency of its associated wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

## Connection to the [[heisenberg_uncertainty_principle_in_quantum_mechanics | Uncertainty Principle]]

The [[heisenberg_uncertainty_principle_in_quantum_mechanics | Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] states that the more precisely one knows a particle's position, the less certain one can be of its momentum, and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This is a specific instance of a more general trade-off observed in various wave phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

If a particle is described as a wave packet spread over space, its Fourier transform reveals the distribution of its spatial frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. Since momentum is proportional to spatial frequency, the momentum distribution of the particle is related to the Fourier transform of its position wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

### The Fourier Trade-off

The fundamental Fourier trade-off states that a signal concentrated in time must have a spread-out Fourier transform (meaning it correlates with a wide range of frequencies), and a signal with a concentrated Fourier transform must be spread out in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Applying this to matter waves:
*   If a particle's wave is very concentrated around a single point (meaning its position is well-defined), its Fourier transform must be more spread out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   This means the wave describing its momentum must also be more spread out, making its momentum less certain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
*   Conversely, if the momentum is well-defined, the particle's position will be spread out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

The spread in position and momentum is not an artifact of imperfect measurement, as in Doppler radar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. Instead, it is fundamental to what the particle *is*, because the particle *is* the wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

### "Unsharpness Relation"

The German word for the [[heisenberg_uncertainty_principle_in_quantum_mechanics | Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] might be translated as the "unsharpness relation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. This term more accurately captures the underlying Fourier trade-off without implying inherent unknowability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.

The principle highlights that position and momentum share the same relationship as sound and frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. While randomness and unknowability are present in [[quantum_mechanics_basics_for_beginners | quantum mechanics]], the uncertainty principle itself stems from the premise that matter behaves as a wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. The probabilistic nature of measurements arises from the interpretation of these waves, where the probability of finding a particle in a given region is proportional to the strength of its wave in that region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

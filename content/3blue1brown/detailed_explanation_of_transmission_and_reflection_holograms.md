A hologram is a special kind of recording on film that creates the illusion of looking through a window into a recorded three-dimensional scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:40">[01:57:40]</a>. You can move your head around and observe how light plays off objects in different ways, even though only an empty table and a laser beam are actually present behind the glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This [[basic_concept_of_holograms_and_its_magical_appearance | magical]] effect makes your brain believe something is truly there, despite visual cues confirming otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

The principle behind holography was discovered by Dennis Gabor in 1947 while he was working on electron microscopy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. His fundamental insight reportedly came to him while watching a tennis match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. However, it wasn't until decades later, with the invention of lasers, that [[historical_background_and_development_of_holography | holography]] became practical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. Gabor received the Nobel Prize in 1971 for his discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

## Transmission Holograms
Transmission holograms are the simplest type, where the recorded scene is visible only when illuminated from behind with a laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

### Recording Process
Unlike an ordinary photograph, which records a scene from a single viewing angle and loses all other information, a hologram aims to recreate the entire light field surrounding a scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. This light field is an incredibly complex, undulating electromagnetic field whose specifics depend on every optical property of the objects and their illumination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. To record this, typical camera elements like pinholes or lenses (which limit exposure to a single viewing angle) are removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.

The key to recording the full light field is to capture not just the amplitude (brightness) of light waves, but also their phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. Standard photography only records the average intensity, proportional to the square of the wave's amplitude, completely losing phase information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.

To record phase, a second beam of light, called the **reference wave**, is shone onto the film simultaneously with the light reflecting off the object (the **object wave**) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>. Both waves must have the same frequency, necessitating the use of a laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.

When the object wave and reference wave [[scientific_principles_behind_holography_including_light_waves_and_interference | interfere]] at the film's plane, their combined amplitude determines the exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>.
*   If the waves are in sync (in phase), they [[scientific_principles_behind_holography_including_light_waves_and_interference | constructively interfere]], producing a strong amplitude and high exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.
*   If they are out of sync (out of phase), they [[scientific_principles_behind_holography_including_light_waves_and_interference | destructively interfere]], resulting in a low amplitude and minimal exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.
This process creates an exposure pattern on the film that is highly sensitive to the phase shifts in the object wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.

The resulting exposure pattern looks nothing like the original objects; instead, it appears as a "complete mess" of rapidly oscillating fringes between points of high and low exposure when viewed under a microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>. This pattern is incredibly sensitive to even tiny movements (hundreds of nanometers) of the scene's objects during recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>, necessitating extreme stillness during the exposure time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.

#### Example: Hologram of a Single Point (Fresnel Zone Plate)
Consider recording a hologram of the simplest object: a single point floating in 3D space, emitting a radial wave (the object wave) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>. If the reference wave is a plane wave coming in perpendicular to the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>:
*   At the film's center (closest to the object point), if the waves are in phase, the exposure is strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:00">[14:21:00]</a>.
*   As you move away from the center, the distance to the object point changes, causing the object wave's phase to fall in and out of sync with the reference wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a>.
*   This results in a pattern of concentric rings of high and low exposure, known as a **Fresnel zone plate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[15:43:00]</a>.

The spacing between these fringes (rings) gets smaller further from the center, approaching the wavelength of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:00">[15:51:00]</a>. This pattern encodes the 3D coordinates of the point: the center of the rings gives the XY coordinates, and the ring spacing determines the Z coordinate (distance from the film) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>.

### Reconstruction Process
The "magic" of holography occurs during reconstruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>. When all objects are removed from the scene and only the reference beam is shone onto the exposed film, it produces a complete recreation of the original object wave beyond the glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.

In the case of the single point hologram, the Fresnel zone plate pattern on the film acts like a **diffraction grating** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:45:00">[16:45:00]</a>. When the reference wave passes through it, the film splits the wave into distinct beams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:46:00">[16:46:00]</a>.

A key relationship for diffraction gratings is `D * sin(theta) = lambda`, where `D` is the spacing between slits/fringes, `theta` is the angle of the diffracted beam, and `lambda` is the wavelength of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:21:00">[22:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:53:00">[22:53:00]</a>. This applies to the Fresnel zone plate too <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:17:00">[26:17:00]</a>.

Crucially, one of the first-order diffracted beams from the zone plate exactly matches the angle of the line connecting that point on the film to where the original object was during recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:50:00">[26:50:00]</a>. This means that every point on the film emits a beam that appears to originate from the original object's position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:24:00">[27:24:00]</a>. As an observer moves their head, the apparent bright spot on the glass moves, creating the illusion of a floating point of light behind it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:46:00">[27:46:00]</a>.

#### Other Beams and the Conjugate Image
When a hologram is reconstructed, it actually produces a sum of three different light waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:57:00">[28:57:00]</a>:
1.  **Scaled copy of the reference wave (zeroth order beam)**: This appears as a bright glow coming from everywhere behind the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:01:00">[29:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:08:00">[29:08:00]</a>.
2.  **Copy of the object wave**: This is the desired reconstruction of the object, corresponding to one of the first-order beams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:08:00">[29:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:13:00">[29:13:00]</a>.
3.  **Conjugate image**: This is a peculiar artifact where the light refocuses onto a reflected version of the original object on the opposite side of the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:19:00">[29:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:31:00">[29:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:55:00">[29:55:00]</a>. Dennis Gabor initially struggled with this, as it muddied his desired holographic image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:57:00">[29:57:00]</a>.

To achieve a clean separation of the reconstructed object wave from the zeroth-order beam and the conjugate image, the reference beam is typically shone onto the film at an angle during recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:10:00">[30:10:00]</a>.

#### Complexity and Resolution
While the single-point example provides intuition, real objects are more complex than a collection of points, especially those that refract light, like a glass Klein bottle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:32:00">[34:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:42:00">[34:42:00]</a>. The hologram can perfectly recreate these complex optical effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:54:00">[34:54:00]</a>.

For this process to work, the film must have extremely high resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:31:00">[33:31:00]</a>. Standard Polaroid film resolves ~10 lines/mm, and microfilm ~100 lines/mm, but holographic film resolves many thousands of lines per millimeter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:37:00">[33:37:00]</a>. This is necessary because the fringes in a zone plate become very narrow, and faithfully recording these variations is crucial for reconstructing the object beam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:54:00">[33:54:00]</a>. Without sufficient resolution, viewers might not see the object from sharp angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:09:00">[34:09:00]</a>.

### Formal Explanation (Technical Appendix)
Using complex numbers simplifies the mathematical explanation of why holography works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:33:00">[38:33:00]</a>.
Let `R` represent the reference wave and `O` represent the object wave, both as complex numbers that encode their amplitude and phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:46:00">[38:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:48:00">[39:48:00]</a>. The total wave shining on the film is `R + O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:50:00">[38:50:00]</a>.

The exposure pattern on the film is proportional to the square of the amplitude of this combined wave, which is the magnitude of `(R + O)` squared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:56:00">[38:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:56:00">[39:56:00]</a>. In complex numbers, the square of the magnitude of a number is the number multiplied by its complex conjugate (denoted with a star, e.g., R*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:41:00">[41:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:53:00">[41:53:00]</a>. So, the exposure is proportional to `(R + O) * (R* + O*)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:02:00">[42:02:00]</a>.

During reconstruction, only the reference wave `R` shines through the exposed film. The wave immediately after the film can be approximated as `R * (1 - opacity)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:54:00">[40:54:00]</a>. Substituting the exposure term, the resulting wave contains components related to:
1.  **Scaled copy of the reference wave**: `R * (R*R)` which is a real scaling factor times `R` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:58:00">[42:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:35:00">[43:35:00]</a>. This corresponds to the zeroth-order beam seen in the single-point example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:42:00">[42:42:00]</a>.
2.  **Scaled copy of the object wave**: `R * (R*O)` which simplifies to a real scaling factor times `O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:58:00">[42:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:14:00">[43:14:00]</a>. This is the desired reconstructed object wave, regardless of its complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:17:00">[43:17:00]</a>. In the single-point example, this is one of the first-order beams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:26:00">[43:26:00]</a>.
3.  **Conjugate image**: `R * (O*R)`. This term involves the complex conjugate of the object wave, `O*` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:31:00">[43:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:37:00">[43:37:00]</a>. This artifact can be seen as a bizarre, warped, and reflected version of the original scene when the film is flipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:52:00">[43:52:00]</a>.

This algebraic approach shows that a copy of the object wave is intrinsically present on the other side of the film, with no assumptions about the simplicity of the object or reference waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:10:00">[44:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:14:00">[44:14:00]</a>.

## White Light Reflection Holograms
A more advanced variant is the [[practical_applications_and_significance_of_holograms_in_various_fields | white light reflection hologram]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. As the name suggests, these can be illuminated using ordinary white light that reflects off of them, unlike transmission holograms that require laser illumination from behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. For reflection holograms, variations in the exposure through the *thickness* of the film become relevant for filtering out appropriate wavelengths during reconstruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

## Applications and Significance
Holography's significance extends beyond art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. Holograms are relevant to [[practical_applications_and_significance_of_holograms_in_various_fields | interferometry]], a technique using [[scientific_principles_behind_holography_including_light_waves_and_interference | wave interference]] to measure extremely tiny distances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. They allow for the measurement of minute shifts in position by observing dark stripes created by light interference between an original scene and its freshly recorded hologram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. The ability to record and reproduce an entire wavefront is a useful tool in various experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

Linear algebra is a subject that is often required knowledge for many technical disciplines, but it can be poorly understood by students taking it for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### Focus on Numerical Operations over Geometric Intuition
Students often learn how to compute various linear algebra operations, such as matrix multiplication, the determinant, cross products, and eigenvalues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. However, they may not [[understanding_linear_algebra | understand]] *why* matrix multiplication is defined in a particular way, *why* the cross product relates to the determinant, or what an eigenvalue truly represents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Students frequently become proficient in the numerical operations of matrices but have only a vague awareness of the [[importance_of_visual_intuition_for_learning_linear_algebra | geometric intuitions]] that underpin them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

A fundamental distinction exists between [[understanding_linear_algebra | understanding linear algebra]] on a numeric level and [[understanding_linear_algebra | understanding it]] on a geometric level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. While both [[geometric_versus_numeric_understanding_in_linear_algebra | understandings]] have their place, [[geometric_versus_numeric_understanding_in_linear_algebra | geometric understanding]] allows one to:
*   Judge which tools to use for specific problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   Feel why those tools work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   Know how to interpret the results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

In contrast, [[geometric_versus_numeric_understanding_in_linear_algebra | numeric understanding]] enables the practical application of those tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### Consequences of Lacking Geometric Intuition
Learning linear algebra without a strong foundation in [[importance_of_visual_intuition_for_learning_linear_algebra | geometric understanding]] can lead to problems that go unnoticed until students delve deeper into their chosen fields, such as computer science, engineering, statistics, economics, or even mathematics itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

Once in a class or job that assumes fluency with linear algebra, the way professors or co-workers apply the field might appear to be "utter magic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. These individuals quickly identify the correct tools and anticipate the approximate answer, which can seem like computational wizardry if one believes they are performing all calculations mentally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

> [!analogy] Sine Function Example
> Imagine first learning about the sine function in trigonometry by being shown an infinite polynomial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a> (which is how calculators evaluate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>). Students might practice computing approximations by plugging numbers into the formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. If the connection to triangles was only vaguely understood and not a course focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, then later in a physics course where sines and cosines are used extensively, seeing others immediately apply them and estimate values would be intimidating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This could make one feel "unduly slow or dumb" and that only those with "computers for brains" are suited for physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

The situation is similar with linear algebra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Although most professors try to convey [[importance_of_visual_intuition_for_learning_linear_algebra | geometric understanding]], many courses still have students spending a disproportionate amount of time on the numerical side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. In practice, computers handle the numerical computations, while humans focus on the conceptual aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Addressing the Challenges
There are core visual intuitions underlying much of linear algebra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Unlike the extreme sine analogy, the link between computation and these visual intuitions is typically straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. When students grasp these intuitions and the relationship between geometry and numbers, the subject's details and its practical [[applications_of_linear_algebra_concepts | applications]] become much clearer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

A short video series aiming to animate these intuitions, from basic vectors to core topics, can help lay down the correct intuitions for more productive and fruitful future [[understanding_linear_algebra | learning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Such resources can also serve as [[educational_resources_for_teaching_linear_algebra | educational resources]] for educators whose courses assume fluency with linear algebra, offering a place for students needing a quick review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

A hologram presents a completely magical experience, creating the illusion of a three-dimensional scene behind a piece of glass [00:00:03]. Viewers can move their heads and observe light interacting with objects in different ways, such as a glass Klein bottle warping what is behind it [00:00:07]. This is an illusion; in reality, there is only an empty table and a diverging laser beam shining on a single piece of film [00:00:17]. This film has been specially exposed to record the entire three-dimensional scene [00:00:23].

The surreal nature of this illusion is striking in person because, despite the absence of physical objects behind the glass, every visual cue convinces the brain that something truly exists there [00:00:32]. For example, a hologram can record a microscopic scene, giving the illusion of a three-dimensional object stored on a two-dimensional piece of film [00:00:48]. By positioning the eye correctly, one can look "down the barrel" of a microscopic hologram and see the imaged microchip [00:00:53].

## What is a Hologram?
Unlike an ordinary photograph, which records a scene from a single viewing angle [00:01:14], a hologram provides an entire continuum of differing perspectives [00:01:18]. Every optical detail, such as the refraction of light through a glass object or a glint off a disco ball, from all possible viewing angles, is stored on that two-dimensional piece of film [00:01:35]. What you are looking at is a [[detailed_explanation_of_transmission_and_reflection_holograms | hologram]] [00:01:41].

While many people associate the word "hologram" with projections seen in fiction like Star Wars, real-world holograms are a special kind of recording taken on film that creates the illusion of looking through a window into a recorded scene [00:01:54].

## [[historical_background_and_development_of_holography | Historical Background]]
The fundamental [[scientific_principles_behind_holography_including_light_waves and interference | principle behind holography]] was discovered by Dennis Gabor in 1947 while he was researching methods for electron microscopy [00:02:03]. His breakthrough insight reportedly came to him while watching a tennis match [00:02:11]. However, holography only became [[practical_applications_and_significance_of_holograms_in_various_fields | practical]] decades later with the invention of lasers [00:02:15]. For his discovery, Gabor was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1971 [00:02:18].

## Types of Holograms
The simplest type of hologram, where the scene is visible only when illuminated from behind with a laser, is known as a [[detailed_explanation_of_transmission_and_reflection_holograms | transmission hologram]] [00:02:25]. More advanced variants, such as the microscope example, are called [[detailed_explanation_of_transmission_and_reflection_holograms | white light reflection holograms]], which can be illuminated using ordinary light that reflects off the film [00:02:40].

## The Core Concept: Recreating the Light Field
The key idea behind a hologram is to recreate the entire light field surrounding a scene [00:04:24]. When light shines on a scene, an incredibly complicated, undulating electromagnetic field surrounds everything [00:04:32]. The specifics of this field depend on every optical property of the objects and the illuminating lights [00:04:40]. An observer's view depends entirely on their position within this light field [00:04:48]. If a procedure can recreate the full state of this field even after the objects are removed, it will produce the complete illusion of the original scene [00:05:11].

Ordinary photography, like a pinhole camera, loses much of this information because it limits exposure to a single viewing angle [00:05:22]. Holography, in contrast, aims to capture all the information from all possible viewing angles [00:04:19].

## Capturing Phase Information
The first step to recording the entire light field is to remove any pinhole or lens [00:05:33]. While this would ordinarily create a blurred mess, the key to making it sensible is to account for another piece of information about light that normal photography loses: **phase** [00:05:45].

Consider a light beam, modeled as an oscillating sine wave, shining on a point of film [00:05:53]. The height of this wave is its amplitude, and how far along in its cycle it is, is its phase [00:06:01]. Standard film exposure is determined only by the amplitude (specifically, the square of the amplitude or average intensity) of the wave [00:06:07]. The film "forgets" the phase of the light that exposed it [00:06:30].

Holography solves this by recording the phase. If a second beam of light, called the **reference wave**, with the same frequency, is shone onto the film along with the light from the scene (the **object wave**), their interference pattern changes based on the phase relationship [00:07:03].
*   If the object wave is in sync with the reference wave, they constructively interfere, producing a higher amplitude and strong exposure [00:07:09].
*   If the object wave is out of phase (e.g., shifted by half a cycle), they destructively interfere, resulting in a much lower amplitude and less exposure [00:07:20].

This process makes the film's exposure highly sensitive to phase shifts, unlike normal photography [00:07:30]. This insight, involving interference with a reference beam, requires all light to have the same frequency, meaning a laser must be used instead of ordinary white light [00:08:01].

### Recording Process
A common setup uses a beam splitter to divide a laser beam [00:08:15]:
1.  Half of the beam is spread out, bounces off the scene (forming the **object wave**), and hits the film [00:08:18].
2.  The other half is also spread out but travels directly to the film (acting as the **reference wave**) [00:08:25].
These two waves interfere at the plane of the film, creating an exposure pattern that heavily depends on the phase of the object wave [00:08:32].

The resulting exposure pattern on the film looks nothing like the original objects [00:09:19]. Under a microscope, it appears as a chaotic mess of rapidly oscillating fringes between points of high and low exposure [00:09:23]. This interference pattern is extremely sensitive to tiny movements of the objects (even a few hundred nanometers) during recording, necessitating extreme stillness during exposure [00:09:34].

## The Magical Reconstruction
The "magic" of holography lies in its reconstruction:
If all objects are removed from the scene and the object beam is blocked, shining only the reference beam onto the exposed film produces a complete recreation of that object wave beyond the glass [00:10:28]. This recreation of light is exactly what would be present if the scene and the object beam were still there [00:10:42].

This delicate, seemingly nonsensical interference pattern on the film somehow records and allows the recreation of an entire three-dimensional scene [00:11:07]. Even a very small circle cut from a recorded film can, when held up to the reference beam, reveal essentially every part of the original scene as the viewer shifts their position [00:11:16].

### Hologram of a Single Point: The Fresnel Zone Plate
To understand how this works, consider the simplest possible object: a single point floating in three-dimensional space [00:11:56]. The light reflecting from this point forms a radial wave (the object wave) [00:12:08]. If the reference wave is modeled as a plane wave perpendicular to the film [00:13:34], the interference between these two waves creates a distinct exposure pattern on the film [00:14:11].

At the center of the film (closest to the object point), if the object and reference waves are in phase, there's strong exposure [00:14:21]. As one moves away from the center, the distance to the object point increases, causing the object wave's phase to periodically fall in and out of phase with the reference wave [00:14:34]. This results in the exposure pattern oscillating between high and low exposure, forming a series of concentric rings [00:15:18]. This pattern is known as a **Fresnel zone plate** [00:15:47].

The spacing between these rings becomes smaller further from the center, approaching the wavelength of light itself [00:15:56]. This pattern encodes the three-dimensional coordinates of the point: the center of the rings gives the XY coordinates, and the ring spacing determines the Z coordinate [00:16:16].

### Reconstruction via Diffraction
When the object and object beam are removed, and only the reference wave shines on the exposed film with its Fresnel zone plate pattern, reconstruction occurs [00:16:31]. A small region of the zone plate pattern resembles parallel stripes, similar to a **diffraction grating** [00:16:42].

A diffraction grating causes light to split into distinct beams [00:20:36]. The angle (theta) of these diffracted beams is related to the spacing (D) between the grating lines and the wavelength (lambda) of the light by the equation: `D * sin(theta) = lambda` [00:22:53].

For a Fresnel zone plate, the spacing (D) between its fringes, multiplied by the sine of the angle (theta prime) connecting a point on the film to the object's past position, also equals the wavelength of light [00:26:17]. Therefore, when the reference wave shines through the zone plate, one of the diffracted beams' angles exactly matches the angle of the line connecting that point on the film to where the object was during recording [00:26:56].

This means that for an observer on the other side of the film, every point of the film emits a beam that matches what a beam from the original object point would have looked like [00:27:11]. As the observer moves their head, the apparent bright spot on the glass moves with them, creating the illusion of a floating point of light behind the glass [00:27:46].

### Artifacts: Zeroth Order and Conjugate Images
When a hologram is reconstructed, several beams are produced [00:28:01]:
*   **Zeroth order beam**: This is essentially a rescaled copy of the reference wave that passes through the film, appearing as a bright glow behind the film [00:28:07]. This can be solved by shining the reference beam in at an angle during reconstruction, separating the desired image from this artifact [00:28:19].
*   **First order beam (Object Wave)**: This is the desired recreation of the wave emanating from the object [00:29:08].
*   **Conjugate image**: Another first order beam, where all the lines converge at a single point on the opposite side of the film [00:28:29]. This term corresponds to a reflected version of the original object [00:29:31]. In early holography, this artifact made it difficult to view the desired image [00:29:57]. Like the zeroth order beam, using an angled reference beam during recording and reconstruction helps separate this artifact from the desired object wave [00:30:07].

### Resolution Requirements
For holography to work effectively, the film must have extremely high resolution [00:33:31]. Standard Polaroid film resolves around 10 lines per millimeter, and microfilm about 100 lines per millimeter [00:33:37]. Holographic film, however, can resolve many thousands of lines per millimeter [00:33:48]. This is necessary because the fringes in a zone plate become very narrow, and faithfully recording these tiny variations is crucial for reconstructing the object beam [00:33:58]. Without sufficient resolution, the viewer would not see the object clearly from sharp angles [00:34:09].

## [[practical_applications_and_significance_of_holograms_in_various_fields | Broader Significance]]
Beyond its use as an art form, the significance of holograms extends to scientific and practical applications [00:36:51]. Holograms are relevant to **interferometry**, a technique that uses wave interference to measure extremely tiny distances [00:37:21]. By superimposing an object with its freshly recorded hologram, tiny shifts in position (due to, for example, a feather touch) become visible as dark interference stripes, which can then be used to measure the size of those shifts [00:37:02]. More broadly, the ability to record and reproduce an entire wavefront is a valuable tool in various experiments [00:37:32].

The development of holography was described by Gabor as an "exercise in serendipity," meaning the art of looking for one thing and finding another [00:37:57]. This highlights that luck often favors a prepared mind, and engaging with the concept of rediscovery can lead to similar moments of insight [00:38:07].

## Formal Explanation using Complex Numbers
For a more formal and powerful explanation of holography, complex numbers can be introduced [00:38:33]. The sum of the reference wave (R) and object wave (O) shining on the film is R + O [00:38:46]. The exposure pattern is proportional to the square of the amplitude of this combined wave, which can be represented as the magnitude squared of the complex sum |R + O|² [00:38:50].

When light waves are treated as the real component of rotating complex numbers, they elegantly encode both the phase and amplitude of the wave [00:39:27]. The amplitude is the complex number's distance from the origin, and the phase is its angle [00:39:54].

Upon reconstruction, when only the reference wave (R) shines through the exposed film, the wave immediately on the other side of the film can be analyzed. The exposure term can be expanded algebraically using the concept of complex conjugates (a number multiplied by its complex conjugate equals the square of its magnitude) [00:41:51]. This algebraic expansion reveals key terms:
*   A scaled copy of the reference wave (R) [00:42:35]. This corresponds to the zeroth order beam [00:42:48].
*   A scaled copy of the object wave (O) itself [00:42:58]. This is the desired reconstruction, representing the original scene, regardless of its optical complexity [00:43:08]. In the single point example, this corresponds to one of the first order beams [00:43:26].
*   A term involving the complex conjugate of the object wave (O*) [00:43:31]. This corresponds to the **conjugate image**, which appears as a bizarre, warped, and reflected version of the original scene if the film is flipped [00:43:37].

This complex algebra demonstrates why a copy of the object wave is produced on the other side of the film, without making assumptions about the simplicity of either the object or reference waves [00:44:03]. While abstract, this formal approach subsumes many complexities and provides reassurance that the shortcomings of simpler explanations are surmountable [00:44:41]. The possibility of storing a three-dimensional scene on two-dimensional film relies on light obeying laws regular enough that the state of a light wave in 3D space is sufficiently constrained by its value on a 2D boundary [00:45:50].

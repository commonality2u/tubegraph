The very first measurement in the cosmological [[distance_measurement_in_the_cosmos | distance ladder]] is the radius of the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:02"></a>. This calculation, attributed to Eratosthenes, is considered a classic tale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:05"></a>.

## Premise: Earth as a Sphere

To even attempt this measurement, one must first assume that the Earth is, at least, roughly spherical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07"></a>. The ancients, including Aristotle, had already deduced the Earth's spherical shape by observing the consistent circular arc of the Earth's shadow on the Moon during lunar eclipses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:22"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:22"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:31"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00"></a>. This understanding was foundational for Eratosthenes' method.

## Eratosthenes' Method

The first person known to have measured the Earth's circumference was Eratosthenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:08"></a>. His method relied on a key astronomical observation and geometric principles.

### The Observation
Eratosthenes had read about a well in the town of Syene (modern Aswan, Egypt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:11"></a>. On the summer solstice, at noon, the Sun's reflection could be seen directly in the water at the bottom of this well, indicating the Sun was directly overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:15"></a>.

Eratosthenes lived in Alexandria, located further north of Syene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:24"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:44"></a>. On the same summer solstice, at noon, he tried the same observation in Alexandria but found no reflection of the Sun in his well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:31"></a>.

### The Deduction
Eratosthenes understood that the Sun is far enough away from Earth that its rays of light are effectively parallel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:47"></a>.
The significance of the summer solstice is that Earth's rotational axis is tilted directly towards the Sun, causing a consistent line of latitude where the Sun is directly overhead at high noon as Earth rotates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:10"></a>. This line is known as the Tropic of Cancer, and Syene is situated on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:36"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:39"></a>.

In Alexandria, being north of the Tropic of Cancer, the Sun was not directly overhead at noon on the summer solstice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:48"></a>. Using a gnomon (an ancient protractor or portable sundial), Eratosthenes measured the angle between the Sun's rays and the vertical direction he perceived as straight up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:59"></a>. He found this angle to be approximately 7 degrees off the vertical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:06"></a>.

Critically, since the Sun was directly overhead in Syene at the same moment, he deduced that the arc length along Earth's surface between Alexandria and Syene was also about 7 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:09"></a>.

### The Calculation
Eratosthenes then used the ratio of this angle to a full circle: the ratio of 7 degrees to 360 degrees must be the same as the ratio of the distance between Alexandria and Syene to the full circumference of the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:24"></a>.

The distance between the two towns was recorded as about 5,000 stadia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:47"></a>. Although the exact conversion of stadia to modern units is debated, 5,000 stadia is roughly 500 miles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:47"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:50"></a>.

From this:
Circumference = (Distance between towns) \* (360 / Angle)
Circumference = 5,000 stadia \* (360 / 7) â‰ˆ 257,142 stadia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:28"></a>.

## Accuracy and Limitations
With conventionally accepted conversions for stadia, Eratosthenes' estimate was about 10% accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:56"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00"></a>. While some sources claim higher accuracy, this often involves selectively choosing stadia conversions to "p-hack" a better number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:03"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:07"></a>.

The primary limitation of this calculation was knowing the precise distance between Alexandria and Syene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:19"></a>. This distance was not officially recorded, but theories suggest it might have been estimated by merchants traveling the Nile or by someone pacing the distance, perhaps a "graduate student" carefully counting steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:26"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:28"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:41"></a>. Despite these challenges, achieving 10% accuracy with no advanced technology was remarkable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:16"></a>.

This single direct measurement of 5,000 stadia, combined with the angular observation, in principle, formed the first step in the [[distance_measurement_in_the_cosmos | distance ladder]] that could theoretically lead to measuring the diameter of the universe, though current methods are more precise due to error accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:51"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:03"></a>.

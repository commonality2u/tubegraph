The famous [[heisenberg_uncertainty_principle_and_its_relation_to_frequency_and_duration | Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] from quantum mechanics states that there is a trade-off between knowing a particle's position and its momentum: the more certain one is about one, the less certain one can be about the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This principle is, in fact, a specific instance of a more [[general_uncertainty_principle_in_nonquantum_contexts_like_sound_waves_and_doppler_radar | general trade-off]] observed in various everyday wave phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## The General Uncertainty Principle

The core idea revolves around the interplay between frequency and duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Observation Duration and Frequency Certainty**: If turn signals flash in sync for only a few seconds, one might think they have the same frequency, but more time might reveal they have different frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. A short observation period yields low confidence in frequency determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Conversely, observing them in sync for a full minute provides much higher confidence in their identical frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This certainty about frequency requires an observation spread out over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Musical Notes**: A shorter musical note makes it less certain to pinpoint its exact frequency or pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. For instance, the pitch of a clap or shockwave is undefinable, even for someone with perfect pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. A more definite frequency necessitates a longer duration signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
    *   More accurately, a short signal correlates highly with a wider range of frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
    *   A signal correlating strongly with only a narrow range of frequencies must last for a longer time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### The Fourier Transform's Role
The [[relationship_between_classical_and_quantum_waves | Fourier transform]] is a key mathematical tool for analyzing frequencies within a signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. It allows viewing a signal not by its intensity over time, but by the strength of its various frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

The concept involves "winding" a signal around a circle, where a rotating vector's length is determined by the signal's height at each point in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   When the winding frequency matches the signal's dominant frequency (e.g., 5 cycles per second), the signal's peaks align on one side and valleys on the other, causing the "center of mass" of the wound-up graph to be off-center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   The position of this center of mass encodes the strength of that frequency in the original signal, and its distance from the origin captures the frequency's strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The angle corresponds to the phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   A "spike" in the Fourier transform indicates a dominant frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. The spread around this spike indicates that nearby frequencies also correlate well with the signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

This [[relationship_between_classical_and_quantum_waves | Fourier transform]] illustrates the uncertainty principle:
*   **Long Duration Signal**: If a signal persists for a long time, even a slight difference in winding frequency from the signal's true frequency will cause it to balance out around the circle. This results in a sharp drop-off in the Fourier transform's magnitude, indicating a very narrow frequency spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   **Short Duration Signal**: If a signal is localized to a short period, it doesn't have enough time to balance out when the winding frequency is adjusted. This requires a more significant change in winding frequency before the signal balances, leading to a much broader peak in the frequency plot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

Therefore, a signal concentrated in time must have a spread-out [[relationship_between_classical_and_quantum_waves | Fourier transform]] (correlating with a wide range of frequencies), and a signal with a concentrated Fourier transform must be spread out in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This is the **general uncertainty principle**.

### Analogy: Doppler Radar
[[general_uncertainty_principle_in_nonquantum_contexts_like_sound_waves_and_doppler_radar | Doppler radar]] provides a tangible example of this trade-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Radar sends out radio wave pulses, and the echo's return time reveals object distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The [[general_uncertainty_principle_in_nonquantum_contexts_like_sound_waves_and_doppler_radar | Doppler effect]] (frequency shift) in the echo can determine an object's velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   An object moving towards the radar will cause the reflected wave's beats to "smush together," resulting in a higher frequency echo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. The size of this frequency shift indicates the object's speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   **The Dilemma**: In Doppler radar, the time of the echo signal corresponds to an object's position, and the frequency of the echo signal corresponds to its velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. A radar operator faces a dilemma:
    *   To be certain about object positions, a quick, short pulse is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. However, a short pulse's Fourier transform is spread out, meaning its frequency representation is broad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. This causes Doppler-shifted echoes from objects with various velocities to overlap in frequency space, making velocity determination ambiguous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
    *   To obtain a sharp view of velocities, an echo occupying a small frequency space is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. But a signal concentrated in frequency necessarily has to be spread out in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. This temporal spread causes echoes from different objects to overlap, making their positions ambiguous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   The [[general_uncertainty_principle_in_nonquantum_contexts_like_sound_waves_and_doppler_radar | Doppler radar]] example demonstrates that crisp delineation for both position (time) and velocity (frequency) is impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. This makes it closely analogous to the [[heisenberg_uncertainty_principle_and_its_relation_to_frequency_and_duration | quantum mechanical Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

## Wave Nature of Particles: De Broglie's Hypothesis

Louis de Broglie, a history major turned physicist, proposed in his 1924 PhD thesis that all matter exhibits [[relationship_between_classical_and_quantum_waves | wave-like properties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Crucially, he concluded that the momentum of any moving particle is proportional to the spatial frequency of that wave (how many times the wave cycles per unit distance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

### Why Momentum Relates to Spatial Frequency
De Broglie's reasoning drew a comparison to the [[general_uncertainty_principle_in_nonquantum_contexts_like_sound_waves_and_doppler_radar | Doppler effect]], where relative movement corresponds to frequency shifts, but in the context of spatial frequency and special relativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

He offered a "crude comparison" for the wave phenomenon he envisioned:
*   Imagine many weights hanging from springs, oscillating in sync, with most mass concentrated at a point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   The energy of these oscillations represents a particle's energy (E=mc²), and de Broglie emphasized that the particle's energy is dispersed across all of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.
*   If this setup is viewed while moving relative to it, the weights appear to fall out of [[wave_behavior_in_materials_and_phase_shift | phase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. This happens because, due to special relativity, events simultaneous in one reference frame may not be simultaneous in another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
*   This "relativistic [[general_uncertainty_principle_in_nonquantum_contexts_like_sound_waves_and_doppler_radar | Doppler effect]]" implies that changes in how mass moves correspond to changes in its spatial frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. Therefore, if mass is energy (E=mc²), and energy is carried as an oscillating phenomenon (like photons), then momentum (related to movement) must be tied to spatial frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

### The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle in the Quantum Case
Applying the general Fourier trade-off to particles:
*   If a particle is described as a wave packet in space, its momentum (up to a constant) is related to the [[relationship_between_classical_and_quantum_waves | Fourier transform]] of that wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.
*   Thus, if the particle's wave is very concentrated around a single point (meaning its position is well-defined), its [[relationship_between_classical_and_quantum_waves | Fourier transform]] (representing its momentum) must necessarily be more spread out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.
*   Conversely, if the momentum wave is concentrated, the position wave must be spread out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

Unlike the [[general_uncertainty_principle_in_nonquantum_contexts_like_sound_waves_and_doppler_radar | Doppler radar]] example, where ambiguity arises from measurement techniques, the [[heisenberg_uncertainty_principle_and_its_relation_to_frequency_and_duration | quantum mechanical uncertainty principle]] is fundamental: the particle *is* the wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. Its spread in space and momentum is inherent to its nature, similar to how a musical note's spread over time is fundamental to its identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

> [!note] Unsharpness Relation
> Mainstream references often describe [[heisenberg_uncertainty_principle_and_its_relation_to_frequency_and_duration | Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]] as a statement about "unknowability" or "indeterminacy" in the quantum realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. However, it's more accurately a trade-off between how concentrated a wave and its frequency representation can be, applied to the premise that matter is a wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. The German term for the principle, "unsharpness relation," better captures this Fourier trade-off without implying limits on knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

The "randomness and unknowability" in quantum mechanics exist but arise at a deeper level, in how these waves are interpreted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. When a particle is measured, its presence appears probabilistic, with the probability proportional to the wave's strength in that region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
*   A wave concentrated near a point implies a higher probability of finding the particle there, meaning greater certainty about its location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.
*   Since this concentration implies a more spread-out [[relationship_between_classical_and_quantum_waves | Fourier transform]], the wave describing its momentum would also be spread out. This means there wouldn't be a narrow range of momenta where the particle has a high probability of being found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

The fascination of the [[heisenberg_uncertainty_principle_and_its_relation_to_frequency_and_duration | Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] lies not just in its statement about randomness, but in the underlying idea that position and momentum share the same relationship as sound and frequency. It's as if a particle's momentum is the "sheet music" describing its movement through space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

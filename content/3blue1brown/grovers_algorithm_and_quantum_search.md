The block collision puzzle, which demonstrates how two colliding blocks can compute pi, is "secretly connected to [[connection_to_quantum_computing | quantum computing]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. More specifically, this connection relates to [[grovers_algorithm_and_quantum_search | Grover's Algorithm for Search]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

Studying this pure, albeit unrealistic, physics puzzle can help one understand what [[connection_to_quantum_computing | quantum computing]] entails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

A key aspect of this connection lies in why the pi digits appear when the mass ratio increases by powers of 100, rather than powers of 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This question's answer is "intimately connected with the fact that for [[connection_to_quantum_computing | quantum computers]], [[grovers_algorithm_and_quantum_search | search algorithms]] can be faster than they are for classical computers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

The connection between the block collision problem and [[grovers_algorithm_and_quantum_search | Grover's algorithm]] was noticed by theoretical physicist Adam Brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. The full explanation of how these two seemingly unrelated topics are "secretly the same thing" will be detailed in a subsequent video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

The "state space" diagram used to solve the block collision puzzle, where velocities are represented as a point moving on a circle, holds the "key connection to the [[connection_to_quantum_computing | quantum computing]] parallel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. The expression for the slope in this diagram, which is the "negative square root of the big mass divided by the small mass," will be "very important for us later when we get to the [[connection_to_quantum_computing | quantum computing]] case" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

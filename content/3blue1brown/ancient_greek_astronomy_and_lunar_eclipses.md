The journey to understand the vastness of the cosmos began with fundamental measurements on Earth. Early astronomers, particularly the Ancient Greeks, utilized keen observation and clever mathematical reasoning to deduce cosmic distances, often relying on phenomena like lunar eclipses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40">[00:40]</a>.

## Deducing the Earth's Shape

A foundational step in measuring cosmic distances was understanding the shape of the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02">[02:02]</a>. To even ask about Earth's radius, one must first presume it's roughly spherical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07">[02:07]</a>. The most convincing early proof came from observations of the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16">[02:16]</a>.

*   **Lunar Eclipses as Proof**: [[keplers_contributions_to_astronomy | Aristotle]], for example, used lunar eclipses to infer Earth's shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22">[03:22]</a>. Lunar eclipses occur when the Moon passes into the Earth's shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28">[03:28]</a>. This shadow, visibly cast on the Moon, consistently appears as a circular arc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31">[03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47">[03:47]</a>. If every shadow cast by a body is a circle, that body must be a sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51">[02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17">[03:17]</a>. This observation requires no advanced technology, merely looking at the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52">[03:52]</a>.

## Measuring the Earth's Radius

The first known person to measure the Earth's circumference was [[eratosthenes_and_the_measurement_of_earths_circumference | Eratosthenes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08">[04:08]</a>.

*   **[[eratosthenes_and_the_measurement_of_earths_circumference | Eratosthenes]]' Method**: [[eratosthenes_and_the_measurement_of_earths_circumference | Eratosthenes]] learned of a well in Syene (modern Aswan) where, on the summer solstice, the Sun's reflection could be seen directly below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11">[04:11]</a>. In his own city, Alexandria, located further north, he observed that the Sun was not directly overhead at noon on the summer solstice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24">[04:24]</a>.
    *   Assuming the Sun's rays are parallel due to its great distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47">[04:47]</a>, and knowing Syene lay on the Tropic of Cancer where the sun is directly overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10">[05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36">[05:36]</a>, [[eratosthenes_and_the_measurement_of_earths_circumference | Eratosthenes]] used a gnomon to measure the angle of the Sun's rays from the vertical in Alexandria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59">[05:59]</a>.
    *   He found this angle to be about 7 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06">[06:06]</a>. This angle corresponded to the arc length along Earth's surface between Alexandria and Syene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18">[06:18]</a>.
    *   By knowing the distance between the two cities (approximately 5,000 stadia, or 500 miles, possibly estimated by merchants or "graduate students" pacing the distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28">[07:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41">[07:41]</a>), he could set up a ratio: 7 degrees / 360 degrees = distance between cities / Earth's circumference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24">[06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28">[06:28]</a>.
    *   This method yielded an estimate for Earth's circumference with about 10% accuracy, remarkable given the lack of technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00">[07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16">[07:16]</a>.

## Measuring the Earth-Moon Distance

With an understanding of Earth's size, the next step on the "distance ladder" was to deduce the distance to the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11">[08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14">[08:14]</a>.

*   **Using Lunar Eclipses**: The Ancient Greeks again used lunar eclipses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20">[08:20]</a>. During an eclipse, the Moon traverses the Earth's shadow, which has a size approximately twice the radius of the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29">[08:29]</a>.
    *   Lunar eclipses last no longer than four hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42">[08:42]</a>. The Moon takes one lunar month (about 28 days) to complete its orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49">[08:49]</a>.
    *   By comparing the duration of an eclipse (e.g., 3.5 hours for the Moon to traverse Earth's shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41">[09:41]</a>) to the lunar month, one can work out the relationship between the Moon's distance and Earth's radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54">[08:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43">[09:43]</a>.
    *   [[heliocentric_model_and_aristarchus_theories | Aristarchus]] of Samos used this method to estimate the distance to the Moon as about 60 Earth radii <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56">[09:56]</a>. This estimate is remarkably accurate, as the Moon's orbit varies between approximately 58 and 62 Earth radii <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00">[10:00]</a>.

## Measuring the Moon's Size

The relative size of the Moon and Earth can be visibly seen during lunar eclipses; the Moon is about a quarter as wide as the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09">[10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12">[10:12]</a>. However, the Greeks used a different, more precise method.

*   **Using Moonrise Observation**: By timing how long it takes for the full Moon to rise above the horizon (around two minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23">[10:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27">[10:27]</a>, and understanding that this phenomenon is primarily due to Earth's rotation (taking roughly 24 hours for a full cycle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30">[10:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40">[10:40]</a>, they could determine the ratio between the Moon's radius and its distance from Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49">[10:49]</a>.
*   Knowing the distance to the Moon (from the eclipse method), they could then calculate its radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57">[10:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59">[10:59]</a>. These estimates were decent approximations, despite the Moon's elliptical orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01">[11:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05">[11:05]</a>.

## Measuring the Earth-Sun Distance

The Sun presented a greater challenge for ancient astronomers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15">[11:15]</a>.

*   **Solar Eclipse Coincidence**: A key observation was that during a solar eclipse, the Moon and the Sun appear to be almost exactly the same size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27">[11:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33">[11:33]</a>. This means the ratio of the Moon's radius to its distance from Earth is similar to the ratio of the Sun's radius to its distance from Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44">[11:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49">[11:49]</a>.
*   **Phases of the Moon**: The phases of the Moon demonstrate its spherical nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12">[13:12]</a>. To estimate the Sun's distance, astronomers observed the exact timing of a half Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29">[13:29]</a>. A half Moon occurs when the Earth and the Sun make a right angle at the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41">[13:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45">[13:45]</a>.
    *   The further away the Sun is, the closer the half Moon point is to the true halfway point between a new Moon and a full Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19">[14:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23">[14:23]</a>.
    *   Using trigonometry, the distance to the Sun is the distance to the Moon divided by the sine of the angle separating the half Moon from the true halfway point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43">[14:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46">[14:46]</a>.
*   **Technological Limitations**: [[heliocentric_model_and_aristarchus_theories | Aristarchus]] attempted this measurement, estimating a discrepancy of 6 hours in the timing of the half Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05">[15:05]</a>. This was inaccurate, as the actual discrepancy is only half an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:15">[15:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16">[15:16]</a>. Ancient Greeks lacked precise clocks and telescopes, making accurate angular measurements extremely difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24">[15:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27">[15:27]</a>.
    *   As a result, [[heliocentric_model_and_aristarchus_theories | Aristarchus]] estimated the Sun to be 20 times further away than the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36">[15:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38">[15:38]</a>, when the true distance is closer to 370 times the Moon's distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42">[15:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46">[15:46]</a>. He also thought the Sun was 7 times larger than Earth, rather than its true size of 109 times larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49">[15:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53">[15:53]</a>.

## The [[heliocentric_model_and_aristarchus_theories | Heliocentric Model]]

Despite the inaccuracy of his measurements, [[heliocentric_model_and_aristarchus_theories | Aristarchus]] made a profoundly important conclusion: the Sun did not move around the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55">[15:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00">[16:00]</a>.

> "Why would the Sun go around the Earth? So the Earth should go around the Sun." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07">[16:07]</a>

This qualitative conclusion, based on his belief that the Sun was vastly larger than the Earth, led him to propose the [[heliocentric_model_and_aristarchus_theories | heliocentric model]] of the solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11">[16:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:23">[16:23]</a>. [[heliocentric_model_and_aristarchus_theories | Copernicus]] later credited [[heliocentric_model_and_aristarchus_theories | Aristarchus]] for this idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26">[16:26]</a>.

However, other Greeks dismissed [[heliocentric_model_and_aristarchus_theories | Aristarchus]]'s theory due to the lack of observable stellar parallax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32">[16:32]</a>. If Earth orbited the Sun, the apparent positions of nearby stars should shift against the background of more distant stars throughout the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42">[16:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00">[17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48">[17:48]</a>. Since this parallax was not observed, they concluded that the Earth must be stationary or that the stars were unimaginably distant, a concept they were unwilling to accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00">[18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:07">[18:07]</a>. The universe is, in fact, billions and trillions of times larger than they could have imagined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:19">[18:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22">[18:22]</a>.

Ancient Greek astronomy laid crucial groundwork, demonstrating how observations of celestial phenomena like lunar eclipses, combined with mathematical reasoning, could provide foundational knowledge about the cosmos, even if limited by available technology. This knowledge paved the way for later breakthroughs by figures like [[keplers_contributions_to_astronomy | Kepler]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:26">[18:26]</a>.

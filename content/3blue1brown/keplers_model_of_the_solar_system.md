Johannes Kepler sought to prove what he considered the most elegant theory in [[keplers_contributions_to_astronomy | astronomy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. His initial model for the solar system proposed a geometric arrangement involving nested spheres and [[platonic_solids_in_astronomy | Platonic solids]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## The Platonic Solids Theory

Kepler's theory envisioned six spheres, corresponding to the six then-known planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The arrangement was as follows:
*   An octahedron inscribed within a sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.
*   The smallest possible sphere fit around that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.
*   An icosahedron fit around that sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
*   Another sphere layered on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   A dodecahedron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   One more sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   A tetrahedron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   One more sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   A cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   A final sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

Kepler hypothesized that the ratios between the sizes of these six spheres would precisely match the ratios of the orbits of the six known planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, believing this set of ratios to be natural or universal due to the involvement of [[platonic_solids_in_astronomy | Platonic solids]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Confrontation with Data and its Outcome

To validate his theory, Kepler acquired [[historical_orbital_data_analysis | orbital data]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Although his method of obtaining and working with this data was described as "heroic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, his geometric model ultimately failed to fit the observations, consistently being off by a few percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

Despite starting with an incorrect premise, this rigorous attempt to confirm his theory paradoxically led Kepler to become the first person to truly understand how planets orbit the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> and to the [[development_of_keplers_laws_of_planetary_motion | development of his famous astronomical laws]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

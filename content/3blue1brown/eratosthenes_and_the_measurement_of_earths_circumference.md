The measurement of [[distance_measurement_in_the_cosmos | cosmic distances]] begins with establishing the size of Earth. [[Terence Tao | Terence Tao]], a renowned mathematician, highlighted this as the first step in humanity's process of figuring out the sizes of objects from Earth to the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The principle behind these measurements is that each accurate calculation unlocks the path to the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. According to Tao, [[distance_measurement_in_the_cosmos | cosmic distance]] measurements rely on mathematical tricks and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Earth's Spherical Shape
The very first measurement of this ladder is the radius of the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. To even ask this question, one must first presume that the Earth is a sphere, or at least roughly spherical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Ancient Deductions
The ancients first deduced the shape of the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. A consistent theme in the [[distance_measurement_in_the_cosmos | distance ladder]] is that to measure one object, like the Earth, a reference object some distance away is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. If we could view Earth from many different angles, its roundness would be apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

Aristotle provided a convincing proof of Earth's shape using the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. He observed [[ancient_greek_astronomy_and_lunar_eclipses | lunar eclipses]], which occur when the Moon passes into the Earth's shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The Earth's shadow, as visibly observed during these eclipses, always appears as a circular arc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This visible proof, observable without telescopes or spacecraft, indicates that the Earth is round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This relies on a geometric argument that if a convex body's every projection is a circle, it must be a sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Eratosthenes' Method for Earth's Circumference

The first known individual to measure the size of the Earth was Eratosthenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### The Observation
Eratosthenes learned of a well in the town of Syene where, on the summer solstice, the Sun's reflection could be seen directly in the water below, indicating the Sun was directly overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Being in Alexandria, further north, he tried the same experiment on the summer solstice at noon but found no reflection of the Sun in his well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

Knowing the Earth was round, Eratosthenes understood that the Sun's rays, being far enough away, were effectively parallel when reaching Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. On the summer solstice, the Earth's axis of rotation is tilted directly towards the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. This results in a consistent line of latitude, known as the Tropic of Cancer, where locations experience the Sun directly overhead at high noon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Syene is situated on this line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

### The Measurement
In Alexandria, Eratosthenes used a gnomon, an ancient protractor or sundial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. He measured that the Sun was approximately 7 degrees off the vertical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Since the Sun was directly overhead in Syene at that exact moment, he deduced that the arc length along the Earth's surface between Alexandria and Syene was about 7 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

This led to the proportion: the ratio of 7 degrees to the full 360 degrees of a circle must be the same as the ratio of the distance between the two towns to the full circumference of the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

The distance between Syene and Alexandria was recorded as approximately 5,000 stadia, which converts to about 500 miles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. The accuracy of the conversion between stadia and miles is not completely certain in modern times, with Eratosthenes' estimate being about 10% accurate with conventionally accepted conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

### Challenges and Legacy
The specific method Eratosthenes used to measure the distance between the towns is not recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Theories include estimates from merchants traveling the Nile or hiring someone to pace and count steps between the cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. The 5,000 stadia measurement was the only direct measurement in his calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. While errors accumulate, in principle, this single measurement could begin a ladder to measure the diameter of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

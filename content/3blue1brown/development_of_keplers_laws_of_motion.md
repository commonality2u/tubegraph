Johannes Kepler initially sought to validate an elegant theory in astronomy involving geometric ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Kepler's Initial Geometric Theory
Kepler's early [[keplers_geometric_theory_of_planetary_orbits | geometric theory of planetary orbits]] proposed a system where a sphere was inscribed within an octahedron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Around this, a smaller sphere was fit, followed by an icosahedron, and then another sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This pattern continued with a dodecahedron, a sphere, a tetrahedron, a sphere, a cube, and a final sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This construction resulted in six spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Kepler hypothesized that the ratios between the sizes of these six spheres would correspond to the orbital ratios of the six known planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. He believed these ratios, derived from platonic solids, represented a natural or universal set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Confirmation Attempts and Breakthrough
To confirm his [[keplers_geometric_theory_of_planetary_orbits | theory]], Kepler acquired [[astronomical_observations_and_their_impact_on_physics | orbital data]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. His method of obtaining this data was described as "completely heroic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. However, the theory did not accurately fit the observed data, consistently being off by a few percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

Despite starting with an incorrect premise, this process ultimately led Kepler to become the first person to understand how planets truly move around the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This endeavor culminated in his [[keplers_discovery_of_planetary_motion | discovery of planetary motion]] and the development of his famous astronomical laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

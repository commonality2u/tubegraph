Kepler initially sought to prove what he considered the most elegant [[historical_astronomical_theories | theory in astronomy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This theory posited a specific geometric arrangement involving spheres and Platonic solids.

## The Theory's Structure

Kepler's geometric model was constructed as follows:
*   Imagine a sphere inscribed within an octahedron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.
*   Fit the smallest possible sphere around that octahedron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.
*   Then, fit the smallest possible icosahedron around that sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
*   Layer on another sphere, followed by a dodecahedron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   Add one more sphere, then a tetrahedron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   Include one more sphere, a cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   Finally, add one last sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

This construction yields six spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Kepler believed that the ratios between the sizes of these six spheres would match the ratios of the orbits for the six then-known planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The use of Platonic solids in this [[geometry_of_spheres_and_cylinders | geometric theory]] was considered a natural or universal set of ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Attempted Confirmation and Outcome

Kepler was eventually able to acquire some [[keplers_calculations_of_planetary_orbits | orbital data]] to try and confirm his theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Although his method of confirmation was described as "completely heroic," he found that the theory consistently failed to fit the observed data, being off by a few percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

Despite starting with a flawed premise, this very attempt led Kepler to become the first person to truly understand how planets move around the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This pivotal work ultimately resulted in the [[development_of_keplers_laws_of_motion | development of his famous astronomical laws]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, which marked a major step in the [[keplers_discovery_of_planetary_motion | discovery of planetary motion]].

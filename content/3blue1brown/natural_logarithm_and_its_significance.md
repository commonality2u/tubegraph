The [[natural_logarithm_and_proportionality_constants | natural logarithm]], denoted as `ln(x)` or `log_e(x)`, is a fundamental concept in mathematics that appears in various seemingly unrelated contexts, from the [[density_of_prime_numbers_and_natural_log | distribution of prime numbers]] to [[exponential growth and decay | exponential growth]] and [[series_and_sums_in_relation_to_natural_log | sums of series]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:18">[06:17:18]</a>. It is defined by the relationship `ln(x) = y` which is equivalent to `e^y = x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:30">[04:51:30]</a>. This means the natural logarithm answers the question: "e to what power equals x?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

## Prime Number Density

One surprising appearance of the natural logarithm is in predicting the [[density_of_prime_numbers_and_natural_log | density of prime numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. For a very large number, like a trillion (10^12), the proportion of numbers around that value that are prime is approximately one divided by its natural logarithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. For example, the natural logarithm of a trillion is approximately 27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. This suggests that around a trillion, about one in every 27 numbers is prime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. This remarkable connection highlights why it is called the "natural" logarithm, as it frequently appears in "natural" mathematical phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>.

## Natural Logarithm in Series and Sums

The natural logarithm also has deep connections to infinite [[series_and_sums_in_relation_to_natural_log | series and sums]]:

*   **Basel Problem Connection**: The sum of the reciprocals of squares (1/1^2 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^2 + ...) equals π²/6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. A peculiar manipulation of this series, where terms that are powers of primes are scaled down, results in a sum equal to the [[natural_logarithm_and_proportionality_constants | natural logarithm]] of (π²/6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.
*   **Leibniz Formula for Pi Connection**: The alternating sum of reciprocals of odd numbers (1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ...) equals π/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. Playing a similar "prime-filtering" game with this series leads to a sum that equals the [[natural_logarithm_and_proportionality_constants | natural logarithm]] of (π/4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>.
*   **Alternating Harmonic Series**: The alternating harmonic series (1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + ...) converges to the [[natural_logarithm_and_proportionality_constants | natural logarithm]] of 2 (ln 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>. This can be derived by generalizing the series using powers of x, taking its derivative to obtain a geometric series (1 / (1+x)), and then integrating that back to `ln(1+x)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>. Evaluating this integral from 0 to 1 yields `ln(2)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>.
*   **Harmonic Series**: The [[series_and_sums_in_relation_to_natural_log | harmonic series]] (1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ...) does not converge; it grows without bound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>. However, the sum up to `n` terms is approximately equal to the [[natural_logarithm_and_proportionality_constants | natural logarithm]] of `n` (ln n) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:00">[16:54:00]</a>. More accurately, it's `ln(n)` plus [[natural_logarithm_and_proportionality_constants | Euler's constant]] (approximately 0.577) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:00">[17:02:00]</a>. This relationship is evident when comparing the sum to the [[natural_logarithm_and_proportionality_constants | integral of 1/x]], which is `ln(x)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:59:00">[55:59:00]</a>. For example, to exceed a sum of a million, `n` must be roughly `e` to the power of a million, a colossal number (around 10^400,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:00">[19:28:00]</a>.

## The Significance of 'e' and its Derivative

The number `e` (approximately 2.71828) is often chosen as the base for [[exponential_functions_and_their_properties | exponential functions]] in physics, engineering, and mathematics due to its unique property related to rates of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:15:00">[24:15:00]</a>.

The defining characteristic of `e` is that the derivative of `e^t` with respect to `t` is simply `e^t` itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:00:00">[31:00:00]</a>. This means the rate of [[exponential growth and decay | growth]] of a quantity described by `e^t` is always equal to the quantity's current value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:25:00">[31:25:00]</a>.

While any [[exponential_functions_and_their_properties | exponential function]] `a^t` grows proportionally to itself, `e^t` grows *exactly* equal to itself, making the [[natural_logarithm_and_proportionality_constants | proportionality constant]] one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:42:00">[31:42:00]</a>. This simplifies [[mathematical_notation_and_conventions | mathematical notation]] and makes constants more readable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:06:00">[33:06:00]</a>. For example, the derivative of `e^(r*t)` is `r * e^(r*t)`, where `r` directly represents the growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:52:00">[31:52:00]</a>. This property is also crucial in [[the_significance_of_eulers_formula | Euler's formula]] (`e^(i*t)`), where `t` directly represents the angle or distance walked around the unit circle, as the derivative `i * e^(i*t)` indicates a 90-degree rotation of the position vector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:17:00">[34:17:00]</a>.

The derivative of any [[exponential_functions_and_their_properties | exponential function]] `a^x` is `ln(a) * a^x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:08:00">[45:08:00]</a>. This shows that the [[natural_logarithm_and_proportionality_constants | natural logarithm]] serves as the [[natural_logarithm_and_proportionality_constants | proportionality constant]] for the growth rate of any exponential base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:17:00">[45:17:00]</a>.

## Derivative and Integral of Natural Logarithm

The derivative of the [[natural_logarithm_and_proportionality_constants | natural logarithm]] `ln(x)` is `1/x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:59:00">[53:59:00]</a>. This can be derived using [[exponential_functions_and_their_properties | implicit differentiation]]: if `y = ln(x)`, then `x = e^y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:07:00">[52:07:00]</a>. Taking the derivative of `x = e^y` with respect to `x` yields `1 = e^y * dy/dx` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:18:00">[52:18:00]</a>. Rearranging gives `dy/dx = 1 / e^y`, and since `e^y = x`, then `dy/dx = 1/x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:52:00">[52:52:00]</a>.

Conversely, the [[natural_logarithm_and_proportionality_constants | integral of 1/x]] is `ln(x)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:55:00">[59:55:00]</a>. This inverse relationship between the derivative of `ln(x)` and the integral of `1/x` underscores the central role of the natural logarithm in calculus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:49:00">[54:49:00]</a>. For example, the definite [[natural_logarithm_and_proportionality_constants | integral of 1/x]] from 1 to `n` is `ln(n) - ln(1)`, which simplifies to `ln(n)` since `ln(1) = 0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>.

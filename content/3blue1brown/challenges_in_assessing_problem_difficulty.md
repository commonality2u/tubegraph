Assessing the actual difficulty of a problem, particularly in mathematics, presents significant challenges, even for experienced educators and problem designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>. This difficulty is so profound that it can be considered "way harder than the math itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:00]</a>.

## The International Math Olympiad (IMO) as a Case Study

The International Math Olympiad (IMO) provides a clear illustration of how challenging it can be to accurately gauge problem difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. The IMO involves over 100 countries sending six of their brightest teenagers to compete in a two-day test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Each day features three proof-based questions, scored from 0 to 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

### Typical IMO Difficulty Progression

Typically, the three problems given each day at the IMO are designed to get progressively harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.
*   Problems one and four are expected to be "doable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.
*   Problems two and five are considered "challenging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.
*   Problems three and six are designed to be "brutal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

### Unexpected Difficulty of Problem 2 (2011)

In the 2011 IMO, with 563 participants from 101 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>, problem number two proved to be unexpectedly difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. Only one participant, Lisa Sauermann from Germany, achieved a perfect score overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Problem two was the only obstacle preventing the next two top runners from a perfect score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

The statistics for perfect scores on problems in 2011 revealed a discrepancy in perceived versus actual difficulty:
*   **Problem 2:** Only 22 participants received full marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.
*   **Problem 5:** 170 participants achieved a perfect score, despite being considered of similar difficulty to problem 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.
*   **Problem 3:** More than twice as many students (at least 45) got a perfect score on problem 3, which was *supposed* to be harder than problem 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.

### Lessons from Problem 6 Solvers

Problem 6 in the 2011 IMO was objectively the hardest, with only six students achieving full marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. These six students were phenomenal, world-class problem solvers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. Yet, even among this elite group, problem 2 (the "windmill puzzle") evaded five out of six of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. This highlights that a problem's difficulty isn't always tied to background knowledge, but rather to the insight it demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>.

## Why is Difficulty Assessment Challenging?

### Hindsight Bias

Once a solution is known, it is "very easy to fool yourself into thinking that the problem is easier than it is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>. For instance, the key insight for the windmill problem—counting points on either side of the line as an invariant—might seem obvious in hindsight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>. However, given the vast number of possible approaches to a problem, it's not immediately apparent why one's mind would turn to that specific idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>.

### Difficulty of [[understanding_difficult_math_problems | Empathy]]

One significant challenge in teaching and problem design is the inherent difficulty in [[understanding_difficult_math_problems | empathizing]] with what it feels like to not understand something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:00">[13:23:00]</a>. Creators of math exercises consistently struggle to accurately gauge how difficult their own exercises are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>.

This insight is crucial for both teachers and students, as it emphasizes that perceived simplicity after a solution is known does not diminish the original difficulty of the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>.

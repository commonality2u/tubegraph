The spread of a virus, exhibiting [[exponential_growth | exponential growth]], is determined by two primary factors: the average number of people each infected individual is exposed to (E), and the probability (P) that each exposure results in a new infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. For the [[COVID19 pandemic analysis | COVID-19 pandemic]], the number of cases on any given day tended to be 1.15 to 1.25 times the number of cases from the previous day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The spread only slows if E or P decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## How Public Health Measures Influence Spread
Public health measures aim to reduce these factors, E and P, thereby slowing the rate of infection and moving away from the rapid multiplication seen in [[exponential_growth | exponential growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

Specifically, the following actions can have an impact:
*   **Reducing Exposure (E)**: This factor can decrease when people reduce social interaction, such as by stopping large gatherings and limiting travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   **Lowering Infection Probability (P)**: The rate at which an exposure leads to a new infection can be reduced by adopting better hygiene practices, like more frequent hand washing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

## Sensitivity of Exponential Growth to Changes
[[exponential_growth | Exponential growth]] is highly sensitive to small changes in the constant multiplier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Even a seemingly small reduction in the growth rate can lead to a drastic difference in the projected number of cases over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

For instance, if the daily growth rate is 15%, 21,000 cases could escalate to over 100 million in 61 days. However, if that rate is reduced to 5% through measures that decrease exposure and infection probability, the projection for the same period drops significantly to around 400,000 cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This demonstrates that if people take sufficient precautions, the severity of the outbreak can be significantly mitigated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Conversely, a lack of concern and action can lead to a much more severe outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

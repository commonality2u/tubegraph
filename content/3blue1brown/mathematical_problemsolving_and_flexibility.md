The debate surrounding pi (π) and tau (τ) highlights the importance of mathematical conventions. Many argue that the fundamental circle constant should be tau (τ), the ratio of a circle's circumference to its radius (approximately 6.28), rather than pi (π), the more familiar ratio to its diameter (approximately 3.14) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Tau was popularized by Michael Hartle's tau manifesto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Proponents of tau suggest that many formulas appear cleaner when using it, primarily because the number of radians for a given fraction of a circle is simply that fraction of tau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

To understand how pi became the standard, we can examine the notes and letters of Leonhard Euler, one of history's most influential mathematicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Ben Hambrecht, a 3b1b Switzerland correspondent, accessed original documents from Euler's hometown library <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Euler's Flexible Notation

Surprisingly, in some early writings, Euler used "pi" to denote the circumference of a circle with a radius of 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This value, 6.28, is what we now call tau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. It's likely he used the Greek letter pi as an abbreviation for "perimeter" (p) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

However, the widespread adoption of pi as 3.14 began with an early calculus book published in 1748 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. In Chapter 8, when describing the semi-circumference of a circle with radius 1 (after expanding it to 128 digits, one of which was incorrect), the author stated, "which for the sake of brevity I may write pi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This book and section were pivotal in popularizing the notation throughout Europe and eventually the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. The author of this influential work was, once again, Euler himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

Euler's use of the symbol pi was highly flexible, much like our modern use of the Greek letter theta (θ) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Just as theta can represent various angles depending on the context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, Euler let pi represent whichever circle constant best suited the [[Problemsolving strategies in mathematics | problem]] at hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. For instance, he used pi to represent a quarter turn of a circle (what we now call pi halves or tau fourths) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. It is worth noting that Euler typically framed his work in terms of unit circles with a radius of one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, so the 3.14 value was often conceived as the ratio of a circle's semi-circumference to its radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## The Importance of Flexibility in Mathematical Problem Solving

Euler's approach to mathematical notation offers a crucial lesson for how we should engage with mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Euler was a prolific [[Problemsolving strategies in mathematical puzzles | problem solver]], constantly generating new insights and fields of mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. He authored over 500 books and papers, averaging 800 pages of dense mathematics per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, with an additional 400 publications surfacing after his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. His focus was not on rigid adherence to a single fundamental circle constant, but on efficiently solving the specific task before him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

For some problems, a quarter circle constant was most natural; for others, the full circle constant; and for still others, like in his famous calculus book, the half circle constant was most appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Shifting Focus from Right vs. Wrong

Often, math education emphasizes which of several competing views on a topic is "right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. For example:
*   Is the sum of all positive integers negative 1/12, or does it diverge to infinity? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>
*   Can infinitesimal values in calculus be taken literally, or is it only correct to speak in terms of limits? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>
*   Are you allowed to divide a number by zero? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>

Such questions, in isolation, are often not the primary concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Instead, the focus should be on solving specific [[Problem solving strategies in mathematics | problems]], whether practical or for intellectual curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. When questions of standards arise, they should be answered with respect to a given context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Different contexts will naturally lead to different conventions, and this is acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Euler's incredible output suggests that a flexible approach to conventions correlates with deep and transformative mathematical insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

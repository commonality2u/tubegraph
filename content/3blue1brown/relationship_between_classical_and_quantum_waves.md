The study of waves provides crucial foundational knowledge for understanding quantum mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Many ideas central to quantum mechanics, such as describing states as [[polarization_and_superposition_in_quantum_mechanics | superpositions]] with various amplitudes and phases, emerge naturally in the context of classical waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This classical understanding helps to appreciate what is fundamentally different in quantum mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Classical Understanding of Light as Electromagnetic Waves

A natural starting point, mirroring the origin of quantum mechanics itself, is light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. In the late 1800s, light was understood as waves in the electromagnetic field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Electric and Magnetic Fields
The electric field is a vector field where arrows at each point in space indicate the direction and strength of the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. A charged particle in this field experiences a force in the direction of the arrow, proportional to the arrow's length and the particle's charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

Similarly, the magnetic field is another vector field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. When a [[electromagnetic_waves_and_charged_particles | charged particle]] moves through a magnetic field, it experiences a force perpendicular to both its direction of motion and the magnetic field's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This force's strength is proportional to the particle's charge, velocity, and the magnetic field arrow's length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. For instance, a wire with current near a magnet is pushed or pulled by the magnetic field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Maxwell's Equations and Wave Propagation
[[maxwells_equations_and_electromagnetic_waves | Maxwell's equations]] describe how electric and magnetic fields interact and cause changes in each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. For example, a loop in the electric field corresponds to an increasing magnetic field, and a loop in the magnetic field corresponds to a change in the electric field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. A natural consequence of this mutual interplay is the propagation of waves where the electric and magnetic fields oscillate perpendicularly to each other and to the direction of propagation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This phenomenon is known as electromagnetic radiation, encompassing phenomena like radio waves and visible light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Mathematical Description of Classical Waves
The mathematical description of waves, even in a purely classical context, introduces concepts vital to quantum mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Wave Components and [[polarization_and_superposition_in_quantum_mechanics | Polarization]]
Consider a wave, such as light, oscillating in a plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. If the electric field oscillates horizontally, the light is horizontally polarized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Its x-component can be described by an equation like `a * cos(2πft + φ)`, where `a` is the amplitude, `f` is the frequency, `t` is time, and `φ` is the phase shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. The phase shift indicates the vector's position in its cycle at time t=0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Light wiggling purely up and down is vertically polarized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### Superposition
If two distinct waves satisfy [[maxwells_equations_and_electromagnetic_waves | Maxwell's equations]], their sum also forms a valid wave, at least in a vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. This is because [[maxwells_equations_and_electromagnetic_waves | Maxwell's equations]] in a vacuum are linear equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. This new wave is called a [[polarization_and_superposition_in_quantum_mechanics | superposition]] of the first two, meaning essentially their sum, or weighted sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

The relative phase shift between components affects the resulting [[polarization_and_superposition_in_quantum_mechanics | superposition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. For example, if horizontal and vertical components are 90 degrees out of sync with equal amplitudes, the result is circularly polarized light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This highlights the importance of tracking both amplitude and phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

### Basis
Waves can be described with respect to different directions, known as a "basis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. For instance, vertically polarized light can be described as a [[polarization_and_superposition_in_quantum_mechanics | superposition]] of diagonal and anti-diagonal directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. The choice of basis depends on the application, such as when light passes through a polarizing filter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. A vertically oriented polarizer absorbs energy from horizontal oscillations, meaning only the vertical component of the original wave passes through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## Transition to Quantum Mechanics: Energy Quantization
Classically, the energy of a wave is proportional to the square of its amplitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. If a wave is a [[polarization_and_superposition_in_quantum_mechanics | superposition]] of horizontal (Ax) and vertical (Ay) components, its energy density is proportional to Ax² + Ay² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. This can be seen as summing the energies of each component or calculating the new amplitude via the Pythagorean theorem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Classically, this energy can be continuously adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

However, late 19th and early 20th-century experiments revealed that light energy comes in discrete amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. Specifically, the energy is always an integer multiple of Planck's constant (h) times the wave's frequency (E = nhf) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. This means there's a minimal non-zero energy level for a given frequency, `hf`, which cannot be made smaller without eliminating the wave entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. This discrete energy packet is called a **photon** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. While this quantization feels unusual for a continuously oscillating field, similar phenomena occur in constrained classical waves like harmonics in pipes or instrument strings; the weirdness is that electromagnetic waves do this in free space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

## Interpretation of Superposition in Quantum Mechanics
The mathematical framework used for classical electromagnetic waves, involving amplitude, phase, [[polarization_and_superposition_in_quantum_mechanics | superposition]], and basis, carries over to describing a photon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

For example, a 45-degree diagonally polarized photon can be described as a [[polarization_and_superposition_in_quantum_mechanics | superposition]] of purely horizontal and purely vertical states, each with an amplitude and phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. However, the interpretation of this [[polarization_and_superposition_in_quantum_mechanics | superposition]] differs fundamentally from classical physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

Classically, if a diagonally polarized wave had an amplitude of 1, its horizontal and vertical components would each have an amplitude of `sqrt(1/2)` (approx. 0.707) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. This would imply half the energy in the horizontal component and half in the vertical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. But a photon cannot have half its energy; energy comes in indivisible chunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. Therefore, these imagined components cannot exist in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

### Measurement and Probabilities
When a diagonally polarized photon is shot at a vertically oriented polarizing filter:
*   Classically, one might expect half the energy to be absorbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.
*   Quantically, because energy is discrete, the photon either passes through with all its energy or is absorbed entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
*   Experiments show that about half the time the photon passes entirely, and about half the time it's absorbed entirely, seemingly at random <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
*   If the photon passes through, its polarization changes to align with the filter's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. This is analogous to Schrödinger's cat: a measurement forces the superposition to collapse into one definite state (e.g., horizontal or vertical) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

### Three Polarizing Filters Experiment
This "measurement effect" can be demonstrated with polarizing filters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>:
1.  If two filters are rotated 90 degrees off from each other, light is completely blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. Photons passing the first filter (e.g., vertically polarized) have a 0% chance of passing the second (horizontally oriented) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.
2.  However, inserting a third filter oriented at a 45-degree angle *between* the two lets more light through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.
    *   50% of photons from the vertical filter pass through the diagonal filter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.
    *   Once they pass, they become purely diagonally polarized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.
    *   These diagonally polarized photons then have a 50-50 chance of passing through the final horizontal filter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.
    *   Overall, 25% of the original photons pass through all three filters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.

This phenomenon cannot be explained classically; it demonstrates that the middle filter forces photons to change their states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.

In quantum mechanics, the squares of the amplitudes of each component in a [[polarization_and_superposition_in_quantum_mechanics | superposition]] do not tell you the *amount of energy* in each direction (as in classical waves), but rather the *probabilities* that a given photon will be found to have all its energy in one direction or another upon measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. For instance, if a photon's polarization is 22.5 degrees off a filter's direction, its vertical component has an amplitude of cos(22.5°) (approx. 0.92) and its horizontal component has an amplitude of sin(22.5°) (approx. 0.38) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. This means there's an 85% chance (0.92²) the photon passes through entirely and a 15% chance (0.38²) it gets completely blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

## Generalization to Quantum Mechanics
The wave equations themselves don't change in quantum mechanics; a photon is still described as a [[polarization_and_superposition_in_quantum_mechanics | superposition]] of oscillating components with phase and amplitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. These amplitudes and phases are often encoded using a single complex number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. This is because complex numbers conveniently encode both an amplitude and a phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

These concepts extend beyond photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. While light was initially understood as a wave and then as quantized particles, there's a "flip side" where particles like electrons, initially understood as discrete packets, were discovered to be governed by similar wavy quantum mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.

In general, quantum mechanical states are described as [[polarization_and_superposition_in_quantum_mechanics | superpositions]] of multiple base states, with many choices for the basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>. Each component has an amplitude and a phase, often encoded as a single complex number, reflecting the underlying wave nature of these objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. The choice of how to measure these objects determines a set of base states, and the probability of finding a particle in one of these base states is proportional to the squares of the amplitudes of these numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>.

If the wavy nature of electrons and other particles had been discovered first, the field might have been called "harmonic mechanics" because the oddity would have been particles governed by wave equations, rather than waves coming in discrete units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.

## Further Exploration
This discussion provides a foundation for understanding deeper quantum mechanical topics, such as [[bells_inequalities_in_quantum_mechanics | Bell's inequalities]], which involves the specific probabilities for angles between polarized filters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

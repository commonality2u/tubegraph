The formula for the [[surface_area_of_a_sphere | surface area of a sphere]], 4πR², is a specific instance of a more general geometric principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This principle applies to all convex shapes in three dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Average Shadow Area Relation

For any convex shape, the [[average_shadow_area_of_geometric_figures | average area of all of its shadows]], when averaged over all possible orientations in 3D space, will be exactly one-fourth the surface area of that shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. This means the fourfold relation observed with spheres is not unique to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The specific details of why this general fact is true are complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>, but it highlights a broader connection between a shape's surface area and its average projected [[surface_area_of_a_sphere_versus_its_shadow | shadow]] area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

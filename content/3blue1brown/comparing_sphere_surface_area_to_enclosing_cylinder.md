The [[surface_area_of_a_sphere | surface area of a sphere]] is calculated as 4π times its radius squared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This means it is exactly four times the area of a circle with the same radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## [[archimedes_proof_of_sphere_surface_area | Archimedes' Proof]]

[[archimedes_proof_of_sphere_surface_area | Archimedes]] developed a proof demonstrating that the [[surface_area_of_a_sphere | surface area of a sphere]] is equivalent to the area of a cylinder that perfectly encloses it, excluding the cylinder's circular caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This is a foundational concept in the [[surface_area_of_a_sphere_visual_proof | visual proof of a sphere's surface area]].

### The Concept of [[projection_of_sphere_onto_a_cylinder | Projection]] and [[surface_area_of_a_sphere_versus_its_shadow | Shadow]]

The core idea behind this proof involves considering the [[projection_of_sphere_onto_a_cylinder | projection]] of small areas from the sphere onto the enclosing cylinder. If light is shone from the z-axis, perpendicular to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, and one compares the area of a small rectangle drawn on the sphere to the area of the shadow it casts on the cylinder, these two areas are found to be identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

Although not immediately obvious, the shadow is a distorted copy of the original rectangle, simultaneously squished in one direction and stretched in another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. However, through [[geometric_reasoning_and_sphere_surface_area | geometric analysis]], these two opposing effects precisely cancel each other out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

By conceptualizing the sphere as a sum of these small patches and the cylinder as a sum of their corresponding shadows, it can be logically inferred that the [[surface_area_of_a_sphere | surface area of the sphere]] is identical to the area of the enclosing cylinder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Calculating the Cylinder's Area

The surface of a cylinder can be unwrapped into a rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   One side length of this rectangle corresponds to the cylinder's circumference, which is 2πr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   The other side length corresponds to the height of the sphere, which is two times its radius (2r) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

Multiplying these dimensions (2πr * 2r) yields the desired area: 4πr² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Relationship to Circle's Area

For those familiar with the technique of unwrapping a circle into a triangle to show its area (where the triangle's height is 'r' and its base is '2πr') <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, it becomes clear that four such unwrapped circles fit perfectly into the unwrapped cylindrical shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

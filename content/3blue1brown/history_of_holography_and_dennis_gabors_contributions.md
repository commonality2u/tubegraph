A [[what_is_a_hologram | hologram]] is a special kind of recording taken on film that creates the illusion of looking through a window into a recorded three-dimensional scene [00:01:54]. This illusion is so convincing that every visual cue available screams to the brain that something truly is there, even when there is nothing but an empty table and a diverging laser beam [00:00:35]. Unlike an ordinary photograph, which records a scene from a single viewing angle, a hologram makes an entire continuum of differing perspectives available [00:01:14].

## Dennis Gabor's Discovery and the Principle of Holography

The fundamental principle behind holography was discovered by Dennis Gabor in 1947 [00:02:03]. At the time, Gabor was working on methods for electron microscopy [00:02:05]. According to anecdote, his key insight came to him while he was watching a tennis match [00:02:07].

Gabor's initial challenge in holography involved the "conjugate image" [00:29:57]. In the earliest days of holography, this artifact made it difficult to clearly view the desired holograms because it would muddy the reconstructed image [00:29:57]. The problem was later solved by using a reference beam that shines on the film at an angle, allowing for a clean separation of the reconstructed object wave from this conjugate wave artifact [00:30:07].

Despite his early work, holography did not become practical until decades later, with the invention of lasers [00:02:15]. For his discovery, Gabor was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1971 [00:02:18]. His achievement underscores the [[applications_and_significance_of_holography | significance of holography]] beyond just an art form [00:36:51]. In his own reflections, Gabor described his discovery not as a deliberate invention, but as "an exercise in serendipity" [00:37:57].

## Early Developments and Types of Holograms

The simplest type of hologram, a transmission hologram, became possible in the late 1960s [00:36:01]. These holograms require illumination with a laser from behind to reveal the scene [00:02:28].

Later, more advanced techniques emerged:
*   **White Light Reflection Holograms** This variant can be illuminated using ordinary light that reflects off the film [00:02:40].
*   **Time-Varying Scenes** Techniques allow changes in a scene over time to be visible as the hologram is viewed from different angles [00:36:14].
*   **Computer-Generated Holograms** It became possible to take a 3D computer graphics model and produce a hologram from it [00:36:21].

For [[how_holograms_are_recorded_and_reconstructed | transmission holograms]], the film can be modeled as a two-dimensional surface with no thickness [00:36:32]. However, for white light reflection holograms, variations in the exposure through the film's thickness become relevant for filtering out appropriate wavelengths during reconstruction [00:36:43].

## Holography's Relation to Light and Information Storage

A key aspect of holography is its ability to record and reconstruct the entire light field around a scene [00:04:28]. This means capturing the incredibly complicated, undulating electromagnetic field that surrounds objects, the specifics of which depend on every optical property of the objects and their illumination [00:04:32]. What an observer sees from different viewing angles is a function of this light field [00:05:07].

Ordinary photography only records the amplitude of light waves, losing information about their phase [00:06:07]. Holography, however, captures the phase of light by interfering an "object wave" (light reflected from the scene) with a "reference wave" (a direct laser beam) [00:06:36]. This interference creates an exposure pattern on the film that is highly sensitive to phase shifts [00:07:30]. This pattern, which looks like a "chaotic mess" or rapidly oscillating fringes under a microscope, bears no resemblance to the original objects [00:09:19].

The process of [[how_holograms_are_recorded_and_reconstructed | recording a hologram]] is incredibly sensitive to movement [00:09:35]. A shift in object position by just a few hundred nanometers (comparable to the light's wavelength) can completely change the exposure pattern [00:09:42]. This sensitivity necessitates extreme stillness during the multi-minute exposure process [00:09:57].

During reconstruction, when only the reference beam shines on the exposed film, it produces a complete recreation of the object wave, giving the illusion that the scene is still present [00:10:28]. The film's high resolution is crucial for this process, as the spacing between fringes in the recorded pattern can be very narrow, often thousands of lines per millimeter [00:33:31]. This high resolution is necessary to faithfully record the variations that allow for the object beam's reconstruction from a wide continuum of viewing angles [00:34:02].

The underlying principles of holography rely on [[interference_and_diffraction_in_holography | interference and diffraction]]. Specifically, the recording of a simple point object creates a concentric ring pattern known as a Fresnel zone plate [00:15:18]. When illuminated, this pattern acts like a diffraction grating, reconstructing the light waves from the original object [00:26:38].

Sometimes, mathematics and physics unexpectedly converge in surprising ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. A peculiar mathematical puzzle, sometimes described as a "mathematical croquet," demonstrates how the digits of [[pi_and_its_formulas_involving_primes | pi]] can emerge from a system of [[colliding_blocks_and_pi_computation | colliding blocks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## The Setup: Idealized Collisions

The puzzle involves two sliding blocks and a wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   The first block begins with some velocity from the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   The second block starts stationary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   Assumptions include no friction and perfectly elastic collisions, meaning no energy is lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The objective is to [[relationship_between_counting_and_pi | count]] the total number of collisions that occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## The Surprising Pattern

The number of collisions depends on the mass ratio of the blocks:

*   **Equal Masses**: If both blocks have the same mass, there are three total collisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The first block hits the second, transferring all momentum, which then bounces off the wall and transfers momentum back to the first block, sending it off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Mass Ratio of 100**: If the first block is 100 times the mass of the second, there are 31 collisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The smaller block repeatedly bounces between the wall and the larger block, gradually redirecting the larger block's momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Mass Ratio of 10,000**: With the first block 10,000 times the mass of the second, there are 314 collisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Mass Ratio of 1,000,000**: If the first block is 1,000,000 times the mass of the second, 3,141 collisions occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

The pattern reveals that when the mass of the first block is a power of 100 times the mass of the second, the total number of [[colliding_blocks_and_pi_computation | collisions]] matches the digits of [[pi_and_its_formulas_involving_primes | pi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Origin of the Discovery

This astonishing fact was introduced by viewer Henry Cavill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a> and was originally discovered by mathematician Gregory Galperin in 1995, with the findings published in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## An Inefficient Pi-Computing Algorithm

This physical phenomenon can be conceptualized as an [[algorithm_for_computing_pi_using_physics | algorithm for computing pi]], albeit a comically inefficient one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>:

1.  **Implement a physics engine** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
2.  **Choose the desired number of digits (d) of pi** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
3.  **Set mass of one block to 100^(d-1)**, with the other block's mass set to 1, and send the larger block towards the smaller one on a frictionless surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
4.  **Count all collisions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

The impracticality of this [[algorithm_for_computing_pi_using_physics | algorithm]] is immense:
*   To compute just 20 digits of [[pi_and_its_formulas_involving_primes | pi]], one block would need to be 100 billion billion billion billion times the mass of the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. If the small block is 1 kilogram, the large block's mass would be about 10 times that of the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   This would require [[relationship_between_counting_and_pi | counting]] 31 billion billion collisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   The frequency of collisions could reach 100 billion billion billion billion clacks per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   Such a simulation would demand extreme numerical precision and an exceptionally long time to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## The Mathematical Mystery

This idealized process quickly departs from real-world physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Its significance lies not in its practicality but in the profound question it raises: why does [[pi_and_its_formulas_involving_primes | pi]] appear here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>? Pi's appearance in a [[relationship_between_counting_and_pi | counting]] context is particularly unusual, as it typically describes continuous phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

The solution involves a [[pis_relationship_to_circles_and_geometry | hidden circle]] derived from the conservation of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This [[problemsolving_strategies_in_mathematical_puzzles | hard puzzle]] encourages individuals to attempt to solve it themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

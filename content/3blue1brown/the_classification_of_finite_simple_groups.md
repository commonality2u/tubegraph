The field of [[introduction_to_group_theory | group theory]] is dedicated to codifying the idea of [[group_theory_and_the_idea_of_symmetry | symmetry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. When something is symmetric, it means certain actions can be taken that leave it looking the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. A collection of all such actions, including the "do-nothing" action, is called a group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

[[symmetries_and_group_actions | Group actions]] describe how elements combine; applying one action after another defines a kind of multiplication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. While groups can be understood through their actions on specific objects, mathematicians often define them more abstractly as a set with a binary operation satisfying four axioms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. This abstraction allows for insights into their inner structure, independent of specific objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

A key concept is *isomorphism*, which means two groups are considered "the same" if their multiplication tables are identical, implying anything true of one is true of the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. For example, the rotations of a cube are isomorphic to the [[the_concept_of_simple_groups_and_permutation_groups | permutation group]] of four objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

## The Fundamental Question: What are All the Groups?

The question "What are all the groups up to isomorphism?" asks for all the ways something can be symmetric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. This question is exceedingly difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. To make it manageable, mathematicians focus on [[finite_and_infinite_mathematical_constructs | finite groups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

### Simple Groups: The Atoms of Symmetry

Just as numbers can be broken down into prime factorizations, or molecules into atoms, [[finite_and_infinite_mathematical_constructs | finite groups]] can be composed of smaller groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. The groups that cannot be broken down any further, analogous to prime numbers or atoms, are known as the [[the_concept_of_simple_groups_and_permutation_groups | simple groups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

Understanding the nature of these [[the_concept_of_simple_groups_and_permutation_groups | simple groups]] is crucial, as it provides non-obvious facts about other mathematical objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. For example, [[introduction_to_group_theory | group theory]] can prove that there is no general formula using radicals to solve degree 5 polynomials, unlike quadratic equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. This impossibility arises from the inner structure of the [[the_concept_of_simple_groups_and_permutation_groups | permutation group]] S5, specifically the type of [[the_concept_of_simple_groups_and_permutation_groups | simple group]] it decomposes into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

## The Classification Theorem

The task of categorizing all [[finite_and_infinite_mathematical_constructs | finite groups]] comes down to two steps:
1.  Find all the [[the_concept_of_simple_groups_and_permutation_groups | simple groups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
2.  Find all the ways to combine them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

The first step, akin to finding the periodic table of elements, has been completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. This monumental achievement involved decades of work, tens of thousands of pages of advanced math, hundreds of mathematicians, and significant computer assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. By 2004, a definitive answer was reached, making it one of the most significant achievements in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

### The Result: Infinite Families and Sporadic Groups

The classification reveals an "absurd" structure for [[the_concept_of_simple_groups_and_permutation_groups | simple groups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>:
*   **18 Distinct Infinite Families:** These include cyclic groups with prime order (symmetries of a regular polygon with a prime number of sides, without flips) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. Another family is similar to [[the_concept_of_simple_groups_and_permutation_groups | permutation groups]] but with a slight constraint on shuffling elements; these are simple if they act on 5 or more elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.
*   **26 Sporadic Groups:** These are the "leftover" [[the_concept_of_simple_groups_and_permutation_groups | simple groups]] that do not fit into the 18 infinite families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. Their existence makes the fundamental structure of [[introduction_to_group_theory | group theory]] seem bizarre and "patched together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

### The Monster Group

The largest of these [[the_sporadic_groups_and_the_monster_group | sporadic groups]] is known as [[the_sporadic_groups_and_the_monster_group | the monster group]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. Its size is approximately 8 x 10<sup>53</sup> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. For context, this is roughly the number of atoms in the planet Jupiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The second largest is called the baby monster group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

While large, the unusual nature of [[the_sporadic_groups_and_the_monster_group | the monster group]] isn't merely its size, as [[the_concept_of_simple_groups_and_permutation_groups | permutation groups]] can be far larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The peculiarity lies in it being a fundamental building block of mathematics that "abruptly stops" at this immense, specific size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.

What object does [[the_sporadic_groups_and_the_monster_group | the monster group]] act on? It describes symmetries in 196,883 dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. Describing just one element of [[the_sporadic_groups_and_the_monster_group | this group]] requires about 4 GB of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

### Mysteries and Connections

No one fully understands why the [[the_sporadic_groups_and_the_monster_group | sporadic groups]], and [[the_sporadic_groups_and_the_monster_group | the monster]] in particular, exist in their specific forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. Despite their fundamental importance to math and arguably physics, much about them remains mysterious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

In the 1970s, mathematician John McKay noticed a number similar to 196,883 appearing in a completely unrelated context: the series expansion of a fundamental function related to modular forms and elliptic functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. This seemingly improbable coincidence was playfully dubbed "moonshine" by John Conway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. As more such numerical coincidences were discovered, it led to the "monstrous moonshine conjecture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.

This conjecture was proved by Richard Borcherds in 1992, establishing a profound connection between seemingly disparate areas of mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. This work contributed to his Fields Medal win in 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. Furthermore, there is a connection between [[the_sporadic_groups_and_the_monster_group | the monster]] and string theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>.

The existence of [[the_sporadic_groups_and_the_monster_group | the monster group]] and its unusual properties serve as a reminder that fundamental objects in mathematics are not necessarily simple or "clean" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. They are what they are by logical necessity, irrespective of human ease of understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.

A key step in understanding the surface area of a sphere involves the geometric principle of unwrapping a cylinder into a rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This technique helps to visualize and calculate the area of the cylinder's curved surface.

## Derivation of Cylinder's Area

For a cylinder that encloses a sphere, if its circular caps are disregarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, its curved surface can be conceptually unwrapped into a flat, two-dimensional rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

The dimensions of this resulting rectangle are defined by the original cylinder:
*   One side length of the rectangle corresponds to the circumference of the cylinder's base, which is `2πr` (where `r` is the radius) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   The other side length of the rectangle corresponds to the height of the cylinder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. In the specific case of a cylinder enclosing a sphere, this height is equal to the diameter of the sphere, or `2r` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

Multiplying these two dimensions (`2πr` and `2r`) gives the area of the rectangle: `(2πr) * (2r) = 4πr²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Connection to Sphere Surface Area

This method is significant because, according to Archimedes' beautiful [[geometric_reasoning_and_sphere_surface_area | geometric reasoning]], the surface area of a sphere is precisely equal to the area of the curved surface of a cylinder that perfectly encloses it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This connection is established through a [[projection_of_sphere_onto_a_cylinder | projection of the sphere onto the cylinder]], where small patches on the sphere cast shadows of identical area on the cylinder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

Therefore, by unwrapping the cylinder, the formula for the surface area of a sphere, `4πr²`, is derived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Comparison to Circle Area

The concept of unwrapping is also used to demonstrate the area of a circle. A circle can be unwrapped into a triangle where its height is the radius (`r`) and its base is the circumference (`2πr`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Interestingly, four of these "unwrapped circles" fit perfectly into the unwrapped cylindrical shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

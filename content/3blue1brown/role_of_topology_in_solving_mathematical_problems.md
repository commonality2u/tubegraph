Topology is a field of mathematics that can be used to solve concrete problems, providing an understanding of why mathematicians value certain shapes and their properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Historically, while concepts like the [[the_concept_of_topology | Möbius strip]] were used to excite imaginations, their practical application in solving problems was not immediately clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Unsolved Problems and Weaker Versions

### The Inscribed Square Problem

The inscribed square problem is an unsolved problem in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. It asks whether it is always possible to find four points on any closed loop—a line squiggled through space that ends back where it started—that form a square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

For specific loops:
*   **Circle**: It is easy to find infinitely many inscribed squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Ellipse**: It is still relatively easy to find an inscribed square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

The problem remains unsolved, meaning current mathematical tools cannot confirm or deny the existence of a loop without an inscribed square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### The Inscribed Rectangle Problem

A weaker version of the problem asks about inscribed rectangles instead of squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This problem, though still difficult, has an elegant solution that showcases the utility of topology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

#### Solution Strategy

The solution shifts focus from individual points on a loop to pairs of points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
A key fact about rectangles is that their diagonals (e.g., AC and BD for rectangle ABCD) share a common midpoint and are equal in length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Conversely, if two distinct pairs of points share a midpoint and have the same distance apart, they form a rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

The goal is to prove that any closed loop always contains two distinct pairs of points that share a midpoint and are the same distance apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

#### Mapping Pairs of Points to a 3D Surface

1.  **Define a Function**: A function is defined that takes a pair of points on the loop and outputs a single point in 3D space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    *   The closed loop is considered to be on the xy-plane in 3D space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
    *   For any given pair of points on the loop, their midpoint `m` (on the xy-plane) and the distance `d` between them are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
    *   A point is plotted `d` units above `m` in the z-direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
2.  **Forming a Surface**: Plotting points for all possible pairs of points on the loop creates a surface above the xy-plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
    *   As the pair of points on the loop get closer, the plotted point gets lower (since `d` decreases) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
    *   When the two points coincide (e.g., `xx`), the distance `d` is zero, and the plotted point lies exactly on the loop itself at point `x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
3.  **Continuity**: This function is [[Continuous mapping and its application in topology | continuous]], meaning slight adjustments to the input pair of points result in only slight adjustments to the output 3D point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
4.  **Collision Goal**: The goal is to show that this function must have a "collision," where two distinct pairs of points map to the same spot in 3D space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Such a collision proves the existence of an inscribed rectangle because it implies shared midpoint and equal distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This means the surface formed by the function must intersect itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

#### Understanding Pairs of Points with Topology

To demonstrate this collision, it's necessary to understand the properties of a 2D surface that naturally represents all pairs of points on the loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

1.  **Ordered Pairs and the Torus**:
    *   By cutting the closed loop and deforming it into an interval (e.g., 0 to 1), each point on the loop corresponds to a unique number on the interval, except the cut point which corresponds to both 0 and 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
    *   Pairs of points on the loop can then be thought of as pairs of numbers (x,y) from the interval, which can be mapped to points in a 1x1 square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
    *   To account for the loop's closure (0 and 1 being the same point), the left edge of the square (x=0) must be glued to the right edge (x=1), and the bottom edge (y=0) to the top edge (y=1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
    *   Performing these gluings transforms the square into a torus (the surface of a doughnut) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Every point on this torus corresponds to a unique ordered pair of points on the loop, and vice-versa, with a [[Continuous mapping and its application in topology | continuous]] association <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

2.  **Unordered Pairs and the Möbius Strip**:
    *   For unordered pairs (where AB is the same as BA), the unit square representing ordered pairs must be folded diagonally, so (x,y) and (y,x) map to the same point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
    *   The diagonal line formed by this fold (where x=y) represents pairs of points that coincide (xx) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
    *   After the diagonal fold, the remaining edges need to be glued. This involves gluing the bottom edge to the right edge with a twist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. This transformation results in a [[the_concept_of_topology | Möbius strip]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
    *   The edge of this [[the_concept_of_topology | Möbius strip]] (the red line) represents the pairs of points like `xx` where the two points coincide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. This [[the_concept_of_topology | Möbius strip]] is the natural shape representing all unordered pairs of points on the loop, and there is a [[Continuous mapping and its application in topology | continuous]] one-to-one association between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

#### The Topological Proof

The solution to the inscribed rectangle problem relies on mapping the [[the_concept_of_topology | Möbius strip]] (representing unordered pairs of points on the loop) onto the 3D surface defined earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

1.  **Edge Mapping**: Since pairs of points `xx` on the loop correspond to points on the red edge of the [[the_concept_of_topology | Möbius strip]], and these `xx` pairs map exactly onto the original loop in the xy-plane (where `d=0`), the edge of the [[the_concept_of_topology | Möbius strip]] must map directly onto the loop itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.
2.  **Forced Intersection**: Due to the unique topological properties of the [[the_concept_of_topology | Möbius strip]], it is impossible to glue its edge to a two-dimensional plane without forcing the strip itself to intersect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.
3.  **Conclusion**: Since points on the [[the_concept_of_topology | Möbius strip]] represent pairs of points on the loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>, an intersection of the strip during this mapping means that at least two distinct pairs of points on the loop map to the same output on the 3D surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. This, in turn, proves that they share a common midpoint and are the same distance apart, thus forming a rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

This proof highlights how [[introduction_to_topology | topological concepts]] and properties, such as the nature of the [[the_concept_of_topology | Möbius strip]], are instrumental in solving concrete [[mathematical_problemsolving_and_flexibility | mathematical problems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. It demonstrates how [[understanding_and_visualizing_mathematical_concepts_in_topology | understanding and visualizing mathematical concepts in topology]] can lead to solutions where other approaches might fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.

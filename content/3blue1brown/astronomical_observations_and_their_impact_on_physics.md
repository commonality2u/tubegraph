[[observing_the_moons_of_jupiter | Observing the moons of Jupiter]] was instrumental in one of the most significant discoveries in the history of physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Observing Io's Orbit

Io, one of Jupiter's moons, darkens when it enters Jupiter's shadow during its cycle, due to Jupiter's immense size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. As it exits the shadow, it becomes bright again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. By observing Io through a telescope night after night, it's possible to precisely mark the time it reappears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. When observed repeatedly, these reappearances generally occur in consistent 42-hour increments, like clockwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

However, this regularity was not always precise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. At different times of the year, Io was either ahead of or behind schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. For instance, when Earth was on the same side of the Sun as Jupiter, Io's emergence was 20 minutes earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Conversely, when Earth was on the opposite side of Jupiter, it took 20 minutes longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This constituted a noticeable delay in [[significance_of_ios_orbital_observations | Io's orbit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Io's Orbit and the Speed of Light

After precise calculations based on these observations, Christiaan Huygens realized the reason for this discrepancy: light was taking time to traverse the varying distance between Earth and Jupiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Specifically, light took approximately 20 minutes to travel an extra distance equivalent to two astronomical units (AU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

At the time, the true value of an astronomical unit was not precisely known, meaning initial estimates for the speed of light based on these observations were not highly accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Furthermore, it was not universally accepted that light had a finite speed; on Earth, light often appeared to travel instantaneously in most experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. However, these astronomical observations revealed that light, when viewed on cosmic scales, is actually quite slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This clever method of measuring light's speed by observing Io, despite its initial imprecision, established the fundamental understanding that light travels at a finite speed, thereby laying the groundwork for more precise [[historical_speed_of_light_measurements | experiments to measure the speed of light]] on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

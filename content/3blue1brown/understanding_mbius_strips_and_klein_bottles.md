[[topological_surfaces_and_their_properties | Topology]] is a branch of mathematics often misunderstood in recreational settings, sometimes presented as merely the "study of bizarre shapes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:17">[02:12:17]</a> or "rubber sheet geometry" where shapes are the same if one can be deformed into another without tearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. However, its true essence lies in understanding continuous associations and what is or is not possible under them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:22">[02:26:22]</a>. Shapes like the [[role_of_mbius_strip_in_topology | Möbius strip]] and [[topological_surfaces_and_their_properties | Klein bottle]] are not just curiosities; they are natural tools for logic and deduction in problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

## The Inscribed Rectangle Problem: A Topological Proof

A central example demonstrating the power of [[topological_surfaces_and_their_properties | topology]] is the proof that every closed, continuous loop necessarily has an inscribed rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. This argument, originally by Herbert Vaughan, serves as a natural introduction to [[topological_surfaces_and_their_properties | topological]] concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.

### Reframing the Problem
The problem of finding an inscribed rectangle can be reframed as searching for two distinct pairs of points on the loop that share the same midpoint and have the same length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. The four endpoints of such line segments will always form a rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

To approach this, one considers all possible pairs of points on the loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. For each pair, two pieces of data are extracted:
1.  **Midpoint Coordinates (x, y):** The location of the midpoint of the pair on the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.
2.  **Distance (d):** The distance between the two points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

These three numbers (x, y, d) can be packaged as a single point in a three-dimensional space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. This creates a continuous mapping from pairs of points on the loop to points in 3D space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. An inscribed rectangle is found when two *distinct* pairs of points map to the *same* output point in this 3D space (a "collision" or "self-intersection") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

The collection of all possible outputs from this mapping forms a complex, "wild surface" in 3D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:07]</a>. For example, the surface generated by a circle is a dome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>, where the peak represents infinitely many pairs that form rectangles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>.

### The Emergence of the Torus

To formally represent all possible pairs of points on a loop, a coordinate system is given to the loop, associating each point with a number between 0 and 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>. A pair of points (x, y) can then be represented as a point in a unit square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>.

Due to the continuous nature of the loop (where 0 and 1 map to the same point), the edges of this square need to be "glued" together:
*   The left edge (x=0) is glued to the right edge (x=1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>, forming a tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>.
*   The bottom edge (y=0) is glued to the top edge (y=1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>, requiring the tube to curl around on itself.

This gluing process results in the surface of a donut shape, known as a torus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>. The torus naturally represents all *ordered* pairs of points on the loop in a continuous, one-to-one fashion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>.

### The Natural Role of the Möbius Strip

However, for the problem of inscribed rectangles, the order of the points in a pair does not matter (a,b is the same as b,a) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:00">[14:21:00]</a>. To account for this, points (x,y) and (y,x) in the unit square must be considered the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33:00">[14:33:00]</a>. This means the square is folded along its diagonal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>.

After this fold and subsequent cutting and gluing of the remaining edges, the resulting surface is a [[role_of_mbius_strip_in_topology | Möbius strip]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>. This non-trivial shape arises very naturally as a way to geometrically represent all possible *unordered* pairs of points on a loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:13:00">[16:13:00]</a>.

The edge of this [[role_of_mbius_strip_in_topology | Möbius strip]] corresponds to pairs of points that are effectively the same spot on the loop (x,x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:00">[16:35:00]</a>. When mapped to the 3D surface, these "x,x" points must land directly on the original loop itself, which sits on the xy-plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:36:00">[17:36:00]</a>.

The proof then hinges on the property that it is impossible to continuously embed a [[role_of_mbius_strip_in_topology | Möbius strip]] into 3D space such that its edge is confined to a plane *and* its interior is strictly above that plane, without the surface self-intersecting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:00">[19:41:00]</a>. This self-intersection on the surface directly translates to finding the desired distinct pairs of points that form an inscribed rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] [[role_of_mbius_strip_in_topology | Möbius strips]] can take on many forms beyond the familiar strip-with-a-twist; for instance, Dan Asimov constructed an embedding where the boundary is a circle, demonstrating its diverse representations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>.

### The [[topological_surfaces_and_their_properties | Klein Bottle]] and Non-Orientable Surfaces

To further solidify the argument about self-intersection, the proof makes a connection to the [[topological_surfaces_and_their_properties | Klein bottle]]. If the 3D surface representing the loop pairs is reflected underneath the xy-plane, the combined surface (the original and its reflection) forms a new closed surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:05:00">[20:05:00]</a>. This new surface is equivalent to gluing the edge of one [[role_of_mbius_strip_in_topology | Möbius strip]] to the edge of another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:18:00">[20:18:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Gluing two [[role_of_mbius_strip_in_topology | Möbius strips]] along their edges results in a [[topological_surfaces_and_their_properties | Klein bottle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:22:00">[20:22:00]</a>.

A [[topological_surfaces_and_their_properties | Klein bottle]] is a famous shape known for having no clear interior or exterior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>. Critically, it is impossible to properly represent a [[topological_surfaces_and_their_properties | Klein bottle]] in three dimensions without the surface intersecting itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:46:00">[21:46:00]</a>. This is a general fact about any closed, non-orientable surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:57:00">[21:57:00]</a>. Since the combination of the loop-pair surface and its reflection forms a [[topological_surfaces_and_their_properties | Klein bottle]], it *must* self-intersect in 3D. This confirms the existence of inscribed rectangles for any closed loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:07:00">[22:07:00]</a>.

## Beyond Rectangles: The Inscribed Square Problem

The [[topological_surfaces_and_their_properties | inscribed square problem]], posed by Otto Toeplitz in 1911, asks whether every closed continuous loop necessarily has an inscribed square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. As of now, no one in the world knows the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

A natural extension of the rectangle proof involves tracking not only the midpoint and distance of a pair of points but also the angle of the line segment connecting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:58:00">[22:58:00]</a>. If two segments share a midpoint and length and differ by 90 degrees, they form a square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:01:00">[23:01:00]</a>. This leads to thinking about embedding [[role_of_mbius_strip_in_topology | Möbius strips]] into [[understanding_higher_dimensional_spheres_and_shapes | four dimensions]], as there are now four numbers (x, y, d, angle) worth of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:10:00">[23:10:00]</a>.

For smooth curves (those with well-defined tangent lines, unlike [[fractals_and_selfsimilarity_misconceptions_and_clarifications | fractals]] or "rough" curves), mathematicians Joshua Green and Andrew Lobb proved in 2020 that inscribed rectangles of every possible aspect ratio can be found, which includes squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:26:00">[23:26:00]</a>. Their work involves embedding [[role_of_mbius_strip_in_topology | Möbius strips]] and [[topological_surfaces_and_their_properties | Klein bottles]] into a four-dimensional space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:51:00">[23:51:00]</a>. The difficulty of the general inscribed square problem lies in dealing with "rough" curves, where the angle of connecting points might not have clean limiting behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:02:00">[25:02:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the study of [[role_of_mbius_strip_in_topology | Möbius strips]], [[topological_surfaces_and_their_properties | Klein bottles]], and other [[understanding_higher_dimensional_spheres_and_shapes | higher-dimensional objects]] in [[topological_surfaces_and_their_properties | topology]] is not for aesthetic appeal alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:47:00">[24:47:00]</a>. These "bizarre properties and impossibilities" serve as crucial constraints and fuel for progress in developing logical proofs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:50:00">[26:50:00]</a>.

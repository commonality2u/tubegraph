[[Topology and its significance | Topology]] is a branch of mathematics often introduced to excite imaginations about mathematical concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Common demonstrations include the [[role_of_mbius_strip_in_topology | Möbius strip]] and the idea that topologists consider coffee mugs and donuts to be the same because each has one hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. For many, these demonstrations initially leave a lingering question about how these concepts constitute mathematics or help solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. However, through elegant solutions to concrete problems, the practical significance of these shapes and their properties becomes clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Core Concepts

### Deforming Shapes
One of the fundamental ideas in [[topology and its significance | topology]] is the study of properties of shapes that remain unchanged under continuous deformations, such as stretching, bending, or twisting, without tearing or gluing parts together. For example, a coffee mug can be continuously deformed into a donut because both have a single hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### The Möbius Strip
The [[role_of_mbius_strip_in_topology | Möbius strip]] is a classic example in [[topology and its significance | topology]]. It can be constructed by twisting a rectangle and gluing its ends together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. A key property of the [[role_of_mbius_strip_in_topology | Möbius strip]] is that it has only one side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

### Continuity
In the context of [[topology and its significance | topology]], continuity means that if you slightly adjust a given input, the corresponding output is only slightly adjusted as well, without any sudden jumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This concept is crucial when mapping points from one space or surface to another.

## Applications of Topology

### The Inscribed Square Problem
A famous unsolved problem in mathematics is the inscribed square problem. It asks whether every closed loop (a continuous line that ends where it started) in space always contains four points that form a square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. While easy to find inscribed squares for simple shapes like circles or ellipses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, the general case for any arbitrary closed loop remains unsolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### The Inscribed Rectangle Problem
A weaker version of the problem asks if every closed loop always contains an inscribed rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This problem has a beautiful solution rooted in [[topology and its significance | topology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The solution relies on shifting focus from individual points to pairs of points on the loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

A rectangle is characterized by its diagonals: they have the same length and share a common midpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Therefore, the problem reduces to proving that any closed loop must have two distinct pairs of points that share a midpoint and are the same distance apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

#### Representing Pairs of Points
To solve this, a function is defined that takes a pair of points from the loop and outputs a single point in 3D space. This output point's XY coordinates correspond to the midpoint of the pair, and its Z coordinate represents the distance between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. As this function is applied to all possible pairs of points on the loop, it generates a surface in 3D space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The goal is to show that this surface must intersect itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

To understand the properties of this surface, it's necessary to represent all possible pairs of points on the loop as a 2D surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

1.  **Ordered Pairs and the Torus:**
    By "straightening" the closed loop into an interval (e.g., from 0 to 1), ordered pairs of points on the loop can be represented as points within a 1x1 square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Because the ends of the interval (0 and 1) represent the same point on the original loop, the edges of this square must be "glued." Gluing the left edge to the right edge forms a cylinder, and then gluing the bottom edge to the top edge forms a torus (the surface of a doughnut) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Every point on this torus uniquely corresponds to an ordered pair of points on the loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

2.  **Unordered Pairs and the Möbius Strip:**
    For the inscribed rectangle problem, we are interested in unordered pairs of points (where AB is the same as BA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. To represent unordered pairs, the square used for ordered pairs must be folded diagonally, meaning coordinates (x,y) and (y,x) are considered the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. After this fold, the remaining edges (bottom and right) are glued with a specific orientation that requires a twist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. The resulting shape is a [[role_of_mbius_strip_in_topology | Möbius strip]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. The edge of this [[role_of_mbius_strip_in_topology | Möbius strip]] corresponds to pairs of points that are effectively the same point (x,x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

#### The Topological Proof
The solution to the inscribed rectangle problem relies on the fact that there's a continuous, one-to-one association between unordered pairs of points on the loop and individual points on the [[role_of_mbius_strip_in_topology | Möbius strip]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. The special 3D surface defined earlier (where Z is the distance, and XY is the midpoint) can be viewed as a map from this [[role_of_mbius_strip_in_topology | Möbius strip]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

When the two points in a pair are extremely close or coincide, their distance approaches zero, meaning the plotted point on the surface gets very close to or exactly on the original loop in the XY-plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Since the edge of the [[role_of_mbius_strip_in_topology | Möbius strip]] represents these coinciding points, when the [[role_of_mbius_strip_in_topology | Möbius strip]] is mapped onto the 3D surface, its edge must map precisely onto the original closed loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

The crucial topological insight is that it is impossible to attach the edge of a [[role_of_mbius_strip_in_topology | Möbius strip]] to a two-dimensional plane (the original loop in the XY-plane) without forcing the strip to intersect itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. If the [[role_of_mbius_strip_in_topology | Möbius strip]] intersects itself during this mapping, it means that at least two distinct pairs of points from the loop map to the exact same spot on the 3D surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. This "collision" implies that these two distinct pairs of points share the same midpoint and are the same distance apart, which in turn means they form an inscribed rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

This proof demonstrates how seemingly abstract concepts like the [[role_of_mbius_strip_in_topology | Möbius strip]] arise naturally in solving concrete mathematical problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>, showcasing the practical utility of [[topology and its significance | topology]] beyond simple demonstrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

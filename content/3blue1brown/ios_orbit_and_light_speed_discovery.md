Observations of Jupiter's moons were instrumental in one of the most significant discoveries in the history of physics: the finite speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Observing Io's Eclipses

Io, one of Jupiter's moons, regularly falls into Jupiter's shadow, causing it to go dark every cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. As it emerges, it becomes bright again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. By watching Io through a telescope night after night, observers could mark the exact time it reappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Initially, these reappearances appeared to occur in precise 42-hour increments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## The Unforeseen Discrepancy

However, this seemingly precise "clockwork" was not exact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. At different times of the year, Io's reappearances were either ahead of schedule or behind schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. When Earth was on the same side of the Sun as Jupiter, Io's reappearance was approximately 20 minutes earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Conversely, when Earth was on the opposite side of the Sun from Jupiter, it took about 20 minutes longer for Io to reappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This indicated a delay in the orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Huygens' Groundbreaking Realization

After performing precise calculations, [[Huygens calculations on light speed | Huygens]] realized that this 20-minute discrepancy was due to light taking time to traverse the extra distance between Earth and Jupiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Specifically, light was observed to take 20 minutes to cross a distance equivalent to two [[Impact of astronomical units on light speed | astronomical units]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Early Estimations and Their Impact

At the time of [[Huygens calculations on light speed | Huygens']] discovery, the true size of an [[Impact of astronomical units on light speed | astronomical unit]] was not accurately known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Consequently, the initial [[Historical estimations of light speed | estimates for the speed of light]] based on this observation were not numerically impressive by modern standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

However, the more profound realization was that light possessed a finite speed at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. For most experiments conducted on Earth, light appeared to travel instantaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Yet, at [[Distance measurement in the cosmos | astronomical scales]], it became evident that light traveled quite slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This ingenious method of measuring light's speed, despite its initial imprecision, laid the essential groundwork for more accurate experiments performed on Earth once a rough understanding of light's velocity had been established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

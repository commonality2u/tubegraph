Understanding how to [[calculating_derivatives_and_their_applications | compute derivatives]] is crucial because many real-world phenomena that calculus aims to analyze are modeled using various mathematical functions, such as polynomials, trigonometric functions, and exponentials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

Developing fluency in understanding rates of change for these "pure" or abstract functions provides a fundamental language. This language then enables a more straightforward discussion and analysis of how things change in concrete, real-world situations that calculus is used to model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

While the process of [[calculating_derivatives_and_their_applications | computing derivatives]] can sometimes feel like rote memorization of rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, it's important to remember that derivatives fundamentally describe how a tiny change in one quantity relates to a resulting tiny change in another quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This concept of "tiny nudges" is at the heart of derivatives and is essential for their [[geometric_interpretation_of_derivatives | geometric interpretation]] and real-world utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

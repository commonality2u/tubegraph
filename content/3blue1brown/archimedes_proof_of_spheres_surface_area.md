The [[surface_area_of_a_sphere | surface area of a sphere]] is given by the formula 4π times its radius squared, which is exactly four times the area of a circle with the same radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Archimedes' Geometric Proof

Archimedes provided a significant [[proofs_of_sphere_surface_area_and_triangle_properties | proof]] demonstrating that the [[surface_area_of_a_sphere | surface area of a sphere]] is equivalent to the surface area of a cylinder that perfectly encloses that sphere, excluding the cylinder's circular caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This concept forms a core part of the [[geometry_of_spheres_and_cylinders | geometry of spheres and cylinders]] and their relationship.

### The Projection Method

The fundamental idea of Archimedes' [[geometric_analysis_of_sphere_and_cylinder | geometric analysis of sphere and cylinder]] involves projecting light from a direction perpendicular to the cylinder's axis (e.g., from the z-axis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
When comparing a small rectangular patch drawn on the sphere's surface to the shadow it casts on the enclosing cylinder, these two areas are found to be identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

Although not immediately obvious, the shadow on the cylinder is a transformed version of the original spherical rectangle, being squished in one direction and stretched in another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. However, when the relevant [[geometric_analysis_of_sphere_and_cylinder | geometry]] is precisely analyzed, these two opposing effects perfectly cancel each other out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This property is key to understanding the [[projection_of_spherical_rectangles_and_area_relationships | projection of spherical rectangles and area relationships]].

### Area Equivalence

By conceptualizing the sphere as a sum of many tiny patches and the cylinder's side as a sum of all their corresponding shadows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, it can be inferred that the [[surface_area_of_a_sphere | surface area of the sphere]] is identical to the surface area of the main body of the enclosing cylinder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This forms the basis of the [[comparing_sphere_surface_area_with_cylinder_surface_area | comparison between sphere and cylinder surface areas]].

### Calculating the Cylinder's Surface Area

A cylinder can be unwrapped into a flat rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. For an enclosing cylinder:
*   One side length corresponds to the circumference of the sphere, which is 2πr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   The other side length corresponds to the height of the sphere, which is twice its radius (2r) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

Multiplying these dimensions (2πr * 2r) yields the area of the cylinder's lateral surface: 4πr² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Since the sphere's surface area is proven to be equal to this, the [[surface_area_of_a_sphere | sphere's surface area]] is thus 4πr² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Connection to Circle Area

Further insight can be gained by recognizing the [[connection_between_sphere_and_circle_area_formulas | connection between sphere and circle area formulas]]. The area of a circle (πr²) can be shown by unwrapping it into a triangle with a height of *r* and a base of 2πr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. When visualized, four of these unwrapped circular triangles perfectly fit into the unwrapped rectangular shape of the cylinder, visually reinforcing that the sphere's area is four times that of a circle with the same radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

Sometimes, mathematical and physical phenomena align in unexpectedly elegant ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. A peculiar experiment involving sliding blocks and perfectly elastic collisions demonstrates a surprising connection between the number of collisions and the digits of [[pis_relationship_to_circles_and_geometry | pi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The underlying reason for this connection lies in [[conservation_laws_in_classical_physics | conservation laws]], specifically [[conservation_laws_in_classical_physics | conservation of energy]], which reveals a [[geometry_and_circles | hidden circle]] within the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## The Colliding Blocks Experiment

Consider a setup with two sliding blocks and a wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The first block approaches from the right with a certain velocity, while the second block is initially stationary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The experiment assumes idealistic physics conditions: no friction and all collisions are perfectly elastic, meaning no energy is lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The goal is to count the total number of collisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### Collision Counts and Mass Ratios

The number of collisions observed varies dramatically with the mass ratio between the two blocks:

*   **Equal Masses (1:1 ratio)**: When both blocks have the same mass, the first block hits the second, transferring all its momentum. The second block then bounces off the wall and transfers its momentum back to the first. This results in **3 total collisions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Mass Ratio 100:1**: If the first block is 100 times heavier than the second, the lighter block will repeatedly bounce between the wall and the heavier block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This process gradually redirects the heavier block's momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. In this scenario, there are **31 total collisions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Mass Ratio 10,000:1**: With the first block 10,000 times heavier, the number of collisions significantly increases to **314** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Mass Ratio 1,000,000:1**: For a mass ratio of 1,000,000 to 1, the total count of collisions reaches **3,141** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### The Appearance of Pi

A clear pattern emerges: when the mass of the first block is a power of 100 times the mass of the second (i.e., $100^n$), the total number of collisions corresponds to the digits of [[pis_relationship_to_circles_and_geometry | pi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This discovery was initially made by mathematician Gregory Galperin in 1995 and published in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## An Impractical Pi-Computing Algorithm

This surprising phenomenon could technically be viewed as an "algorithm" for computing [[pis_relationship_to_circles_and_geometry | pi]], albeit a comically inefficient one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>:

1.  Implement a physics engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
2.  Choose the number of digits `d` of [[pis_relationship_to_circles_and_geometry | pi]] to compute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
3.  Set the mass of one block to $100^{d-1}$ and the other to 1, then simulate their collision on a frictionless surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
4.  Count all the collisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

To illustrate its impracticality, computing just 20 digits of [[pis_relationship_to_circles_and_geometry | pi]] would require one block to have a mass $100^{19}$ times that of the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. If the small block weighed 1 kilogram, the larger block would have a mass roughly 10 times that of the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This would necessitate counting 31 billion billion collisions, with frequencies reaching 100 billion billion billion billion clacks per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Such a simulation would require immense numerical precision and an exceptionally long time to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## The Underlying Principle: Hidden Circles

The appearance of [[pis_relationship_to_circles_and_geometry | pi]] in this seemingly discrete counting problem is mind-boggling, as [[pis_relationship_to_circles_and_geometry | pi]] typically describes continuous phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. The reason for its emergence lies in the principle of [[conservation_laws_in_classical_physics | conservation of energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

Where [[pis_relationship_to_circles_and_geometry | pi]] appears, there is often a [[geometry_and_circles | hidden circle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. In this collision problem, the [[geometry_and_circles | hidden circle]] is derived directly from the equations governing the [[conservation_laws_in_classical_physics | conservation of energy]] for the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. The exact methods for revealing this [[geometry_and_circles | hidden circle]] are complex and involve two distinct approaches, which are as surprising as the phenomenon itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. These deeper explanations connect the discrete collision counts to the continuous nature of a [[geometry_and_circles | circle]], thereby unveiling the source of [[pis_relationship_to_circles_and_geometry | pi]]'s digits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

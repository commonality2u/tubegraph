Differential equations are described as the language in which the laws of physics are always expressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This language extends beyond physics, adding a new perspective to how one views the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. [[differential_equations_as_a_language_of_physics | Differential equations]] arise when it is easier to describe change rather than absolute amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. For instance, it's simpler to describe how population sizes grow or shrink than their specific values at a given time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. In Newtonian mechanics, motion is described by force, which determines accelerationâ€”a statement about change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

[[introduction_to_ordinary_and_partial_differential_equations | Differential equations]] come in two main types:
*   **Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)**: Involve functions with a single input, often considered as time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. These focus on a finite collection of values changing over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)**: Deal with functions that have multiple inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. They often involve a continuum of values changing with time, such as temperature distribution in a solid body or fluid velocity at every point in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## The Pendulum: A Case Study
Consider the trajectory of a pendulum, which involves the angle `theta` changing as a function of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. While often approximated as simple harmonic motion (like a sine wave), this is only accurate for small angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. For larger angles, the period is longer, and the pattern deviates significantly from a sine wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

The differential equation for a pendulum, including air resistance (`mu`), is given by:
`theta_double_dot = -g/L * sin(theta) - mu * theta_dot` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
This equation is difficult to [[solving_simple_differential_equations | solve]] analytically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Exact solutions can be "hilariously complicated" and involve functions rarely encountered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Often, there is no known analytical solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Instead of finding exact solutions, the focus often shifts to building understanding and making computations directly from the equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

## Phase Space: Visualizing System States
To understand the dynamics of a system like a pendulum, one can visualize its "state" in a multi-dimensional space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. For the pendulum, its state can be described by two numbers: the angle (`theta`) and the angular velocity (`theta_dot`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. These two values form a two-dimensional plane, where each point represents a possible state or initial condition of the pendulum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

This "state space" is an abstract concept, distinct from the physical space where the pendulum moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. For example, an inward spiral in this space represents a pendulum losing energy due to air resistance, with peak velocity and displacement decreasing with each swing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. The system is "attracted" to the origin (0,0), where both angle and angular velocity are zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

### Differential Equations as Vector Fields
A [[differential_equations_and_their_applications | differential equation]] can be visualized as a vector field within phase space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
1.  **State Vector**: The pendulum's state is represented as a vector `(theta, theta_dot)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
2.  **Rate of Change Vector**: The derivative of this state vector, `(theta_dot, theta_double_dot)`, indicates the direction and speed the point will move in the phase diagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. This effectively breaks down a single second-order equation into a system of two first-order equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.
3.  **Vector Field**: By computing this rate of change vector at all points in the phase space, a vector field is created, showing how the state tends to change from any position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

As the system evolves from an initial state, its point in phase space moves along a trajectory such that its velocity at every moment matches the vector from this field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. This velocity in phase space is an abstract rate of change, encoding the rates of change for both `theta` and `theta_dot` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.

Visualizing these vector fields helps build intuition for how systems behave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. For instance, increasing the air resistance parameter (`mu`) immediately shows trajectories spiraling inward faster, meaning the pendulum slows down more quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.

### Higher Dimensions and Phase Flow
While the pendulum example uses two dimensions, any system of ordinary differential equations can be described by a vector field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. These spaces can have many more dimensions. For example, the famous three-body problem, involving three masses in 3D space, has an 18-dimensional state space (3 coordinates + 3 momentum coordinates for each of 3 masses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. In mathematics, such a space is often called a "phase space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

The collection of all possible trajectories in phase space is called "phase flow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. This concept is powerful because it allows for studying not just single initial conditions, but a whole spectrum of initial states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. Questions of "stability" (whether tiny nudges lead back to or away from a fixed point) can be analyzed by examining the flow around those points in phase space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

## Numerical Solutions
Even when analytical solutions are impossible, phase space visualizations lead to [[numerical_methods_and_chaos_theory_in_differential_equations | numerical methods]] for approximating solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. The basic idea is to simulate the system by taking small, finite time steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. If at a point in the phase diagram, one takes a step equal to `delta_t` (small time step) multiplied by the vector at that point, repeating this process approximates the system's evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>. While a large `delta_t` can be inaccurate, a small `delta_t` yields a much more accurate approximation, requiring many repeated steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. This is known as [[numerical_methods_and_chaos_theory_in_differential_equations | solving a differential equation numerically]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.

### Limitations: Chaos Theory
Despite numerical methods, there are further limits to prediction, as highlighted by [[numerical_methods_and_chaos_theory_in_differential_equations | chaos theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>. For some systems, even tiny variations in initial conditions (due to imperfect measurements) can lead to wildly different long-term trajectories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>. The three-body problem, for instance, contains "seeds of chaos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>. This means that even with sophisticated models, precise long-term prediction for certain complex systems remains impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>.

## Analogies: The Mathematics of Affection
The utility of phase space extends beyond physics. Stephen Strogatz uses the mathematics of modeling affection as a whimsical example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. If one's affection increases when a companion is interested but decreases when they are cold, while the companion is attracted when one is uninterested but turned off when one is too keen, the phase space for these "romance equations" looks very similar to the center part of the pendulum diagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. This predicts an endless cycle of affection and repulsion, a "pendulum swing" in feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. Adding a "friction" term (e.g., fear of vulnerability), the system would spiral inward towards mutual ambivalence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>. This illustrates that seemingly different dynamic laws can share similar underlying structures, which are revealed by phase diagrams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. The tactics for studying one case often transfer to many others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

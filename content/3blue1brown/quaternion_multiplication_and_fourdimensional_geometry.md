[[quaternion_multiplication | Quaternion multiplication]] describes a specific motion on a four-dimensional sphere, represented in three-dimensional space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Quaternions are an "absolutely fascinating and often underappreciated number system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Just as [[complex_numbers_multiplication_and_rotation | complex numbers]] are a two-dimensional extension of real numbers, quaternions are a four-dimensional extension of [[complex_numbers_multiplication_and_rotation | complex numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. They have pragmatic utility for describing [[threedimensional_linear_transformations | rotation]] in three dimensions and even for quantum mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Discovery and Early Reception

The story of quaternion discovery is notable in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton sought a three-dimensional number system analogous to [[complex_numbers_multiplication_and_rotation | complex numbers]] for much of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. On October 16, 1843, while crossing the Broom Bridge in Dublin, he realized the need to add two more imaginary dimensions (three imaginary dimensions describing space) and the real numbers, sitting perpendicular to that in a fourth dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. He carved the crucial equation describing these three imaginary units into the bridge, which now bears a plaque in his honor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

At Hamilton's time, the modern notion of vectors with dot and cross products didn't exist in a standardized form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. After his discovery, he advocated for quaternions as the primary language for describing three-dimensional space, forming an official quaternion society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. However, other mathematicians found the notion of [[quaternion_multiplication | quaternion multiplication]] confusing and unnecessary for describing three dimensions, leading to "truly hilarious old-timey trash talk legitimately calling them evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. It's even believed that the Mad Hatter scene in *Alice in Wonderland*, authored by an Oxford mathematician, mocked [[quaternion_multiplication | quaternion multiplication]] due to its non-commutative nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Modern Resurgence

About a century later, the computing industry led to a resurgence of quaternions among programmers working with graphics, robotics, and anything involving orientation in 3D space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This is because they offer an elegant, computationally more efficient, and numerically accurate way to describe and compute [[threedimensional_linear_transformations | 3D rotations]] compared to other methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The 20th century also saw quaternions gain appreciation in quantum mechanics, where their special actions in four dimensions are relevant to describing two-state systems like electron spin or photon polarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Visualizing Quaternions in Four Dimensions

Visualizing quaternions in their full four-dimensional glory can provide natural and satisfying intuition for [[quaternion_multiplication | quaternion multiplication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This involves understanding how to represent what quaternions do in four dimensions within the constraints of our 3D space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Analogy: Describing Complex Numbers to a One-Dimensional Being (Linus)

To understand visualizing four dimensions, it's helpful to start with an analogy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>:
*   **Linus the Linelander** can only grasp one-dimensional geometry and real numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Algebraic Definition**: [[complex_numbers_multiplication_and_rotation | Complex numbers]] can be defined algebraically as a real number plus another real number times `i`, where `i * i = -1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. [[complex_numbers_multiplication_and_rotation | Complex multiplication]] follows the distributive property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Geometric Interpretation**: For those who understand two dimensions, multiplying two [[complex_numbers_multiplication_and_rotation | complex numbers]], `z * w`, can be seen as `z` acting as a function on `w`, rotating and stretching it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   **Communicating Rotation**: The challenge is to communicate the concept of rotation to Linus, which is intrinsically two-dimensional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **[[stereographic_projection_and_visualizing_quaternions | Stereographic Projection]]**: A [[stereographic_projection_and_visualizing_quaternions | stereographic projection]] maps the unit circle (all numbers a distance 1 from 0) onto a line, which is Linus's world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. A line is drawn from -1 on the circle through a point on the circle, intersecting a vertical line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
    *   The point 1 projects to the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
    *   Points `i` and `-i` stay fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
    *   The point -1 projects to a "point at infinity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Linus's View of Rotation**: When the circle rotates (e.g., multiplication by `i`, a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation), Linus sees a "strange morphing action" on the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. For example, 1 moves to `i`, `i` slides off to infinity, -1 comes back from infinity to `-i`, and `-i` slides to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

### Analogy: Describing 3D Rotations to a Two-Dimensional Being (Felix)

Next, the analogy extends to [[threedimensional_linear_transformations | 3D rotations]] for Felix the Flatlander, who understands two-dimensional geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>:
*   **Hypothetical 3D System**: Imagine extending [[complex_numbers_multiplication_and_rotation | complex numbers]] with a third axis, `j`, perpendicular to the complex plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Every point in 3D space would be described by `real + real*i + real*j` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. It's noted that it's *not* possible to define a notion of multiplication for such a 3D number system that satisfies usual algebraic properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
*   **Unit Sphere**: Focus on the unit sphere in this 3D space, where the sum of squares of coordinates is 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **[[stereographic_projection_and_visualizing_quaternions | Stereographic Projection]]**: A [[stereographic_projection_and_visualizing_quaternions | stereographic projection]] associates almost every point on the unit sphere with a unique point on the horizontal plane (i and j axes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. This is done by drawing a line from -1 (south pole) through the point to the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
    *   The point 1 (north pole) projects to the center of the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
    *   The northern hemisphere maps inside the unit circle of the i-j plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
    *   The unit circle (passing through i, j, -i, -j) stays fixed in place, representing an "honest part" of the sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.
    *   The southern hemisphere projects outside the unit circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.
    *   The point -1 projects to a "point at infinity" where you approach it by walking infinitely far in any direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.
*   **Felix's View of Rotation**: When the sphere rotates, Felix sees lines of latitude and longitude project into various circles and lines on his plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.
    *   A 90-degree rotation about the j-axis brings 1 to `i`, `i` to -1, -1 to `-i`, and `-i` to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. Felix sees his unit circle transform into a vertical line, while the vertical line transforms into the unit circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
    *   A rotation about the real axis appears as a simple rotation of the whole projection about the origin for Felix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

### Quaternions and Four-Dimensional Geometry

Quaternions include real numbers and three separate imaginary dimensions, `i`, `j`, and `k`, each perpendicular to the real number line and to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.
*   **Structure**: Each quaternion is written using four real numbers and lives in four-dimensional space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>, often broken into a real (scalar) part and a 3D imaginary part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. Hamilton coined the term "vector" for quaternions with no real part (just `i`, `j`, `k` components) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.
*   **[[quaternion_multiplication | Quaternion Multiplication]] Rules**: [[quaternion_multiplication | Quaternion multiplication]] can be defined by rules for `i`, `j`, and `k` multiplying together, with distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. This compactness makes them useful for graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. It can also be expressed in terms of the dot product and cross product, effectively subsuming both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>.
*   **Magnitude and Rotation**: The magnitude of a quaternion is the square root of the sum of squares of its components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>. Multiplying `q1` by `q2` scales `q2` by `q1`'s magnitude, followed by a special type of rotation in four dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. These special 4D rotations correspond to the hypersphere of quaternions a distance 1 from the origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.
*   **[[stereographic_projection_and_visualizing_quaternions | Stereographic Projection]] into 3D**: The 4D hypersphere is [[stereographic_projection_and_visualizing_quaternions | stereographically projected]] into 3D space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.
    *   The projection is from the number -1, which sits on the real number line perpendicular to 3D space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>.
    *   The number 1 projects to the center of our 3D space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>.
    *   A whole sphere passing through `i`, `j`, and `k` on the unit hypersphere stays in place under the projection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. This represents the only unaltered part of the hypersphere and corresponds to unit quaternions with a zero real part (unit vectors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.
    *   Unit quaternions with positive real parts project inside this unit sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.
    *   Unit quaternions with negative real parts project outside the unit sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>.
    *   The number -1 projects to the "point at infinity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.
    *   A line through the origin passing through `i` and `-i` in the projection represents a circle on the hypersphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. Similarly, any plane seen in the projection represents a sphere on the hypersphere passing through -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.
*   **Left Multiplication as Double Rotation**: The action of a unit quaternion `q` multiplying another quaternion from the left can be thought of as two separate 2D rotations, happening perpendicularly and in sync in four dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.
    *   **Example: Multiplication by `i`**:
        *   The circle through 1 and `i` (seen as a line) rotates 90 degrees: 1 goes to `i`, `i` to -1 (infinity), -1 to `-i`, and `-i` to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>.
        *   The circle passing through `j` and `k` (perpendicular to the 1-i circle) rotates 90 degrees in the direction of a right-hand rule (thumb pointing from 1 to `i`, fingers curl) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. So, `j` goes to `k`, `k` to `-j`, `-j` to `-k`, and `-k` to `j` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.
    *   **Example: Multiplication by `j`**:
        *   The circle through 1 and `j` rotates 90 degrees, dragging 1 to `j` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>.
        *   The circle through `i` and `k` (perpendicular to the 1-j circle) rotates 90 degrees according to the right-hand rule (thumb pointing from 1 to `j`). This means `j * i` is `-k`, and `j * k` is `i` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>.
*   **Non-Commutative Nature**: The order of [[quaternion_multiplication | quaternion multiplication]] matters; it is not commutative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. For example, `i * j = k`, but `j * i = -k` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>.
*   **Left vs. Right Multiplication**: Quaternions can act by left multiplication (e.g., `i` acts on `j` in `i*j`) or by right multiplication (e.g., `j` acts on `i` in `i*j`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>. For right multiplication, a left-hand rule is used for the perpendicular circle's rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

This visualization approach helps understand how unit quaternions describe [[threedimensional_linear_transformations | rotation]] in three dimensions, which involves a process called conjugation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.

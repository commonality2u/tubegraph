The distinction between harmonious and cacophonous sounds in music can be analyzed mathematically, specifically by examining the ratio of frequencies between two notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## The Musical Harmony Challenge

Imagine a scenario where a musical note is played at a given frequency, for instance, 220 Hz. A second note is then played with a frequency that is `R` times the first note's frequency, where `R` is a number between 1 and 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The challenge is to determine whether `R` will result in a pleasant (harmonious) or unpleasant (cacophonous) sound without actually listening to the notes, relying solely on the analysis of the number `R` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

For some values of `R`, such as 1.5 (which is 3/2), the notes sound harmonious. For others, like the square root of 2, they sound cacophonous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Pythagorean Idea: Rationality and Harmony

Historically, thinkers like Pythagoras proposed that two notes sound good together when their frequency ratio is a [[rational_and_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational number]], and bad when it's [[rational_and_irrational_numbers_in_music | irrational]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Examples of harmonious [[rational_and_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational ratios]] include:
*   3/2, which creates a musical fifth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>
*   4/3, forming a musical fourth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>
*   8/5, yielding a major sixth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>

### The Underlying Mechanism
A musical note is composed of rapid beats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. When the ratio of frequencies of two notes is a [[rational_and_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational number]], a detectable pattern emerges in these beats. When slowed down, this pattern is perceived as a rhythm rather than a harmony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The brain's ability to pick up on this pattern is believed to be why such notes sound pleasing together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Refining the Definition of Harmony

### Complexity of Rational Numbers
While the Pythagorean idea serves as a starting point, most [[rational_and_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational numbers]] actually result in cacophonous sounds, such as 211/198 or 1093/826 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This suggests that the complexity of the rational number plays a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Our ears struggle to perceive the pattern of beats for "complicated" [[rational_and_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

A simple way to measure the complexity of a rational number is to consider the size of its denominator when written in reduced form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Thus, harmony might be associated with [[rational_and_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational numbers]] having "low denominators," for instance, less than 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

### Proximity to Harmonious Ratios
Even this refined definition is insufficient, as many notes sound harmonious even when their frequency ratio is [[rational_and_irrational_numbers_in_music | irrational]], provided it is sufficiently close to a harmonious [[rational_and_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

Many modern instruments, such as pianos, are not tuned using strictly [[rational_and_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational intervals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Instead, each half-step increase in frequency corresponds to multiplying the original frequency by the 12th root of 2, which is an [[rational_and_irrational_numbers_in_music | irrational number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

For example:
*   A musical fifth, expected to be 3/2, is actually 2 to the 7/12 on a piano, which is [[rational_and_irrational_numbers_in_music | irrational]] but very close to 3/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   A musical fourth corresponds to 2 to the 5/12, which is very close to 4/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

The chromatic scale's 12 notes work well because powers of the 12th root of 2 tend to be within a 1% margin of error of simple [[rational_and_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

Thus, a ratio `R` is considered harmonious if it is sufficiently close to a [[rational_and_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational number]] with a sufficiently small denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. "How close" depends on the listener's discernment, and "how small a denominator" depends on the intricacy of harmonic patterns their ear can pick up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. A person with a highly acute musical sense might even find pleasure in the patterns of more complicated fractions like 23/21 or 35/43, and numbers closely approximating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## The Savant and the Paradox of Harmony

Consider a "musical savant" who finds pleasure in all pairs of notes with a [[rational_and_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational ratio]], even the most complicated ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Would such a savant find *all* ratios `R` between 1 and 2 harmonious, including [[rational_and_irrational_numbers_in_music | irrational]] ones? After all, any real number can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a [[rational_and_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

This question leads to a concept in measure theory: it is possible to cover all [[rational_and_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational numbers]] within an interval (e.g., 0 to 1) with an infinite number of open intervals whose total length is arbitrarily small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This is possible because [[rational_and_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational numbers]] can be enumerated (listed in an infinite sequence), allowing for each rational number to be assigned a progressively smaller interval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

This means that while [[rational_and_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational numbers]] are dense in the real numbers (any continuous stretch contains infinitely many [[rational_and_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational numbers]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, the "gaps" between these intervals, predominantly occupied by [[rational_and_irrational_numbers_in_music | irrational numbers]], can be substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. An [[rational_and_irrational_numbers_in_music | irrational number]] like the square root of 2 over 2, for example, would likely fall outside these covering intervals, meaning it is cacophonous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. This is because any [[rational_and_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational numbers]] close to it would have large denominators, resulting in very small covering intervals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

In this context, the savant might find harmonious numbers to be precisely those few (e.g., 1%) covered by these tiny intervals, provided her tolerance for error decreases exponentially for more complicated [[rational_and_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. The paradoxical fact that a collection of intervals can densely populate a range while covering only a small percentage of its values corresponds to the idea that harmonious numbers are rare, even for a savant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. This suggests that even for the savant, a significant majority (e.g., 99%) of all possible frequency ratios could be cacophonous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

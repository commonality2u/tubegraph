When first encountering the [[introduction_to_pythagorean_triples | Pythagorean theorem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, which states that the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides of a right triangle equals the square of its hypotenuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, common examples like the 3-4-5 triangle and 5-12-13 triangle are often introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. It's noteworthy that such integer solutions exist, especially when compared to Fermat's Last Theorem, which states that no integer solutions exist for exponents greater than two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. A triplet of whole numbers (a, b, c) satisfying a² + b² = c² is known as a [[introduction_to_pythagorean_triples | Pythagorean triple]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This article explores a method to find and visualize all possible [[introduction_to_pythagorean_triples | Pythagorean triples]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Historical Context
The problem of finding [[introduction_to_pythagorean_triples | Pythagorean triples]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a> is ancient, with evidence of such triples found on Babylonian clay tablets dating back to 1800 BC, more than a millennium before Pythagoras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

> [!NOTE] A favorite [[proof_and_demonstration_of_the_pythagorean_theorem | proof]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a> of the [[introduction_to_pythagorean_triples | Pythagorean theorem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a> involves arranging squares and triangles. By drawing a square on each side of a right triangle and adding four copies of the original triangle, two large squares with side lengths (a+b) can be formed. The "negative space" (the area of the large square minus four times the area of the triangle) in one arrangement is a² + b², and in the other, it is c² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This visually demonstrates that a² + b² = c² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Rephrasing the Problem: Lattice Points
The problem of finding [[introduction_to_pythagorean_triples | Pythagorean triples]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a> can be reframed as finding points on a grid (lattice points with integer coordinates) that are a whole number distance away from the origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. For example, the point (3,4) is 5 units away from the origin, and (12,5) is 13 units away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Generating Triples Using [[complex_numbers_and_generating_pythagorean_triples | Complex Numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>
Consider the Cartesian plane as a [[complex_numbers_and_generating_pythagorean_triples | complex plane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, where each lattice point (x,y) corresponds to a [[complex_numbers_and_generating_pythagorean_triples | complex number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a> x + yi. Squaring such a [[complex_numbers_and_generating_pythagorean_triples | complex number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a> (u + vi)² yields a new [[complex_numbers_and_generating_pythagorean_triples | complex number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a> whose real and imaginary parts are guaranteed to be integers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

Geometrically, multiplying a [[complex_numbers_and_generating_pythagorean_triples | complex number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a> by itself doubles its angle from the horizontal axis and squares its length (magnitude) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Since the initial length of u + vi is √(u² + v²), squaring it results in a length of u² + v², which is an integer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

For example, starting with 2 + i:
*   Its distance from the origin is √ (2² + 1²) = √5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   Squaring it: (2 + i)² = (2² - 1²) + (2 * 2 * 1)i = 3 + 4i <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   The magnitude of 3 + 4i is 5, which is (√5)² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This generates the 3-4-5 [[introduction_to_pythagorean_triples | Pythagorean triple]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

Another example is 3 + 2i:
*   Its distance from the origin is √(3² + 2²) = √13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   Squaring it: (3 + 2i)² = (3² - 2²) + (2 * 3 * 2)i = 5 + 12i <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   The magnitude of 5 + 12i is 13, which is (√13)² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. This generates the 5-12-13 [[introduction_to_pythagorean_triples | Pythagorean triple]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### General Formula
If the initial lattice point is (u,v), representing the [[complex_numbers_and_generating_pythagorean_triples | complex number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a> u + vi, then squaring it yields a new complex number whose real part is u² - v², imaginary part is 2uv, and magnitude is u² + v² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Thus, (u² - v²), (2uv), (u² + v²) forms a [[introduction_to_pythagorean_triples | Pythagorean triple]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a> for any integers u and v <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

Some choices of u and v can lead to "boring" triples involving zero, for example, 2 + 2i squared gives 8i, which corresponds to the 0-8-8 triple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. However, for the most part, this method is a simple way to generate non-trivial [[introduction_to_pythagorean_triples | Pythagorean triples]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Visualization of the Squaring Transformation
Visualizing the transformation where every point `z` on the [[complex_numbers_and_generating_pythagorean_triples | complex plane]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a> moves to `z²` provides insight into how [[introduction_to_pythagorean_triples | Pythagorean triples]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a> are organized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. When the grid lines of the complex plane are transformed by squaring each point, they turn into parabolic arcs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. The intersections of these parabolic arcs are precisely where lattice points land after the transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. These points correspond to [[introduction_to_pythagorean_triples | Pythagorean triples]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, where the line from the origin to such a point forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle with integer side lengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. This visualization shows a remarkable pattern, organizing triples that might otherwise appear random <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

## Accounting for All [[introduction_to_pythagorean_triples | Pythagorean Triples]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>
While squaring [[complex_numbers_and_generating_pythagorean_triples | complex numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a> generates many [[introduction_to_pythagorean_triples | Pythagorean triples]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, it doesn't account for *every* possible triple directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. For instance, the triple 6-8-10 (corresponding to 6 + 8i) is not directly generated, nor is 9-12-15 (9 + 12i) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. However, these are simply scalar multiples of the 3-4-5 triple, which *is* generated (3 + 4i) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Similarly, 4 + 3i is missed (due to its odd imaginary component) but 8 + 6i (which is 3 + i squared) is hit, meaning 4 + 3i is half of a generated point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

To include these missed multiples, one can draw radial lines from the origin through every generated point, extending to infinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. All lattice points falling on these radial lines will represent valid [[introduction_to_pythagorean_triples | Pythagorean triples]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>, covering all possible ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

## Connection to the [[unit_circle_and_rational_points_in_relation_to_pythagorean_triples | Unit Circle and Rational Points]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>
This method for generating [[introduction_to_pythagorean_triples | Pythagorean triples]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a> is complete. By dividing the [[introduction_to_pythagorean_triples | Pythagorean theorem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a> (a² + b² = c²) by c², we get (a/c)² + (b/c)² = 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. This means every [[introduction_to_pythagorean_triples | Pythagorean triple]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a> corresponds to a [[unit_circle_and_rational_points_in_relation_to_pythagorean_triples | rational point (x,y) on the unit circle (x² + y² = 1)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Conversely, any [[unit_circle_and_rational_points_in_relation_to_pythagorean_triples | rational point on the unit circle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a> can be scaled up to form a [[introduction_to_pythagorean_triples | Pythagorean triple]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

When all the points generated by squaring lattice points (u + vi)² are projected onto the [[unit_circle_and_rational_points_in_relation_to_pythagorean_triples | unit circle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a> along their radial lines, they cover a multitude of [[unit_circle_and_rational_points_in_relation_to_pythagorean_triples | rational points]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. The argument for completeness relies on the slope:
1.  Any [[unit_circle_and_rational_points_in_relation_to_pythagorean_triples | rational point (x,y) on the unit circle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a> can be connected to the point (-1,0) by a line. The slope of this line will be a [[unit_circle_and_rational_points_in_relation_to_pythagorean_triples | rational number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a> (rise over run with rational coordinates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.
2.  The initial [[complex_numbers_and_generating_pythagorean_triples | complex number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a> u + vi makes an angle `theta` with the horizontal axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Its slope is v/u <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
3.  Squaring u + vi results in a point whose angle is 2*`theta` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. This point, when projected onto the [[unit_circle_and_rational_points_in_relation_to_pythagorean_triples | unit circle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>, has the same angle 2*`theta` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.
4.  By circle geometry, the line connecting the [[unit_circle_and_rational_points_in_relation_to_pythagorean_triples | rational point on the unit circle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a> (with angle 2*`theta`) to (-1,0) makes an angle `theta` with the horizontal axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.
5.  Therefore, the slope of this line is precisely v/u <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. Since u and v can be chosen as any integers, we can account for every possible [[unit_circle_and_rational_points_in_relation_to_pythagorean_triples | rational slope]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
6.  Because every [[unit_circle_and_rational_points_in_relation_to_pythagorean_triples | rational point on the unit circle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a> corresponds to a unique [[unit_circle_and_rational_points_in_relation_to_pythagorean_triples | rational slope]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a> from (-1,0), and our method covers all [[unit_circle_and_rational_points_in_relation_to_pythagorean_triples | rational slopes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>, it follows that all [[introduction_to_pythagorean_triples | Pythagorean triples]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a> are accounted for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

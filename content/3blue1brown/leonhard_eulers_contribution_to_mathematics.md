From: [[3blue1brown]] <br/> 

Leonhard Euler stands as one of history's most influential mathematicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. His vast body of work and problem-solving approach have left an indelible mark on the field, often leading to the joke that formulas are named after the second person to prove them, as Euler was invariably the first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

## Euler's Work Ethic and Output

Euler was known for his relentless dedication to solving problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. He consistently produced puzzles, formulas, and insights, pioneering entirely new fields of mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

During his lifetime, Euler authored over 500 books and papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>, averaging a remarkable 800 pages of dense mathematical content per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. After his death, an additional 400 publications surfaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Pi Notation

Euler played a pivotal role in standardizing the mathematical constant pi (Ï€) as it is known today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. However, his use of the symbol was initially more fluid:

*   **Early Usage:** In some of his original notes, Euler defined "pi" as the circumference of a circle with a radius of 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. This value, approximately 6.28, is now commonly referred to as tau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. It's likely he used the Greek letter pi as an abbreviation for "perimeter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.
*   **Standardization:** The 3.1415 constant became the widely recognized standard primarily through Euler's early calculus book, published in 1748 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. In Chapter 8 of this work, after calculating and expanding 128 digits of the semi-circumference of a circle with radius 1, he stated, "which for the sake of brevity I may write pi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. This specific section of his book was instrumental in spreading the notation across Europe and eventually globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.
*   **Flexible Application:** Euler also used the symbol pi to represent a quarter turn of a circle (what is now known as pi halves or tau fourths) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. His use of pi was often analogous to the modern use of the Greek letter theta, serving as a variable for an angle rather than a fixed value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. He adapted the meaning of "pi" to best suit the problem at hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>, although his calculations were typically framed around unit circles with a radius of one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

## Euler's Mathematical Philosophy

Euler's approach to mathematics offers a significant lesson: his focus was not on rigid adherence to specific notational standards, but on effectively solving the particular task before him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. This flexibility towards conventions appears to be correlated with his ability to generate a vast quantity of transformative insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. For Euler, the choice of a constant was determined by its natural fit within the context of a specific problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] On Standards in Math Education
> Euler's example suggests that the emphasis in mathematics education should be on engaging with specific problems and puzzles, whether practical or for the sake of knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. Questions of standards then arise naturally and can be answered within a given context, acknowledging that different contexts may lead to different "most natural" answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

[[introduction_to_topology | Topology]] is a branch of mathematics often introduced to young enthusiasts to spark imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Common demonstrations include the [[role_of_mbius_strip_in_topology | Möbius strip]], highlighting its single-sided property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, or the concept that topologists consider a coffee mug and a donut to be topologically equivalent due to each having one hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

While these demonstrations are intriguing, they often leave a fundamental question: how is this mathematics, and how does it help solve concrete problems? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a> The understanding of why mathematicians value certain shapes and their [[topological_surfaces_and_their_properties | topological properties]] often comes from seeing how they apply to specific challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Topology in Problem Solving: The Inscribed Rectangle Problem

A prime example of topology's practical significance is its application to problems like the inscribed square problem. This problem asks whether it's always possible to find four points on any given closed loop that form a square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. While the inscribed square problem remains unsolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, a weaker version—the inscribed rectangle problem—has an elegant solution that highlights the utility of topological concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

The solution to the inscribed rectangle problem involves shifting focus from individual points on a loop to pairs of points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. A key property of rectangles is that the midpoints of their diagonals coincide, and the diagonals are of equal length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Thus, the problem reduces to proving that any closed loop must contain two distinct pairs of points that share a midpoint and are the same distance apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

To approach this, a continuous function is defined that maps pairs of points on the loop to a single point in 3D space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. For a given pair of points, their midpoint `m` (on the xy-plane) and their distance `d` determine a point `d` units above `m` in the z-direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. As this function is applied to all possible pairs of points, it generates a surface in 3D space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. The objective is to show that this surface must intersect itself, indicating a "collision" where two distinct pairs of points map to the same spot, thereby forming a rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### The Role of Topological Surfaces

To prove this collision, one must understand the natural shapes that represent pairs of points on a loop:

*   **Ordered Pairs:** Representing ordered pairs of points on a loop (where `AB` is distinct from `BA`) naturally leads to the formation of a torus (the surface of a donut) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. This is achieved by conceptualizing the loop as an interval and mapping pairs of values on the interval to a square. Gluing the corresponding edges of this square (e.g., 0 and 1) results in a torus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **Unordered Pairs:** Representing unordered pairs (where `AB` is considered the same as `BA`) leads to the [[role_of_mbius_strip_in_topology | Möbius strip]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. This involves folding the square diagonally to equate `(x, y)` with `(y, x)` and then performing specific edge gluings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. The edge of this [[role_of_mbius_strip_in_topology | Möbius strip]] corresponds to pairs where both points are the same (e.g., `xx`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

The crucial insight is that the surface generated by mapping pairs of points from the loop into 3D space is topologically equivalent to the [[role_of_mbius_strip_in_topology | Möbius strip]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. The edge of the [[role_of_mbius_strip_in_topology | Möbius strip]] (representing pairs like `xx`) maps exactly onto the original loop in the xy-plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

The topological argument then states that it is impossible to attach the edge of a [[role_of_mbius_strip_in_topology | Möbius strip]] to a two-dimensional plane without forcing the strip itself to intersect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. Since points on the [[role_of_mbius_strip_in_topology | Möbius strip]] represent pairs of points on the loop, this self-intersection implies that there must be at least two distinct pairs of points that map to the same location in 3D space. This 'collision' proves that these pairs share a common midpoint and distance, thus forming a rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:15:02]</a>.

This elegant proof demonstrates that [[topology_and_its_significance | topology]] is not merely about playing with construction paper or deforming shapes; it provides powerful tools to solve concrete mathematical problems by offering a natural framework to understand complex relationships, such as those between pairs of points on a continuous loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. The rigor required to justify these intuitive topological facts further develops the field, highlighting why topologists make specific definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

## Kepler's Astronomical Theory

Johannes Kepler sought to prove an elegant theory in astronomy involving [[geometry_of_spheres_and_cylinders | spheres]] and Platonic solids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. His idea proposed a specific arrangement:
1.  A [[geometry_of_spheres_and_cylinders | sphere]] inscribed within an octahedron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.
2.  The smallest possible [[geometry_of_spheres_and_cylinders | sphere]] fitted around that octahedron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.
3.  The smallest possible icosahedron fitted around the second [[geometry_of_spheres_and_cylinders | sphere]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
4.  Another [[geometry_of_spheres_and_cylinders | sphere]] layered on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
5.  Followed by a dodecahedron and one more [[geometry_of_spheres_and_cylinders | sphere]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
6.  Then a [[probability_in_geometry_and_tetrahedrons | tetrahedron]] and another [[geometry_of_spheres_and_cylinders | sphere]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
7.  Finally, a [[highdimensional_geometry_and_cube_coloring | cube]] and one last [[geometry_of_spheres_and_cylinders | sphere]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

This arrangement produced six [[geometry_of_spheres_and_cylinders | spheres]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Kepler believed that the ratios between the sizes of these six [[geometry_of_spheres_and_cylinders | spheres]] would correspond to the orbital ratios of the six then-known planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The use of Platonic solids made this set of ratios feel very natural or universal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### Theory Confirmation and Outcome

Kepler was eventually able to acquire orbital data to attempt to confirm his theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Despite a "heroic" effort in his confirmation method, the theory ultimately did not fit the data, consistently being off by a few percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Lasting Significance

Although Kepler started with an incorrect premise, this endeavor was crucial, as it led him to become the first person to understand how planets actually move around the Sun and to develop his famous astronomical laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

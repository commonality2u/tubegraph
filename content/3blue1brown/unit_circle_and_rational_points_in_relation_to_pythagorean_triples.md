A [[introduction_to_pythagorean_triples | Pythagorean triple]] is defined as any triplet of whole numbers (a, b, c) where a² + b² = c² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Familiar examples include the 3-4-5 triangle and the 5-12-13 triangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The existence of these triples, where the sum of two perfect squares is another perfect square, can be taken for granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This contrasts sharply with cases where the exponent is any whole number greater than 2, which would yield no integer solutions, as famously stated by Fermat's Last Theorem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

The search for [[introduction_to_pythagorean_triples | Pythagorean triples]] is an ancient mathematical problem, with evidence found on Babylonian clay tablets dating back to 1800 BC, predating Pythagoras himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Visualization of Pythagorean Triples as Lattice Points

One way to reframe the problem of finding [[introduction_to_pythagorean_triples | Pythagorean triples]] is to identify which [[visualization_of_pythagorean_triples_using_lattice_points | lattice points]] (points with integer coordinates) on a plane are a whole number distance away from the origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. For instance, the point (3,4) is 5 units away from the origin, corresponding to the 3-4-5 triple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The question of finding [[introduction_to_pythagorean_triples | Pythagorean triples]] is entirely equivalent to finding such lattice points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Most lattice points, like (2,1), have a distance from the origin that is the square root of a whole number (e.g., √5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## Generating Triples Using Complex Numbers

Thinking of the plane as the [[unit_circle_and_complex_plane | complex plane]], where each [[visualization_of_pythagorean_triples_using_lattice_points | lattice point]] (x,y) represents a [[unit_circle_and_complex_plane | complex number]] x + yi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, one can generate points whose distance from the origin is a whole number by squaring the [[unit_circle_and_complex_plane | complex number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

Geometrically, squaring a [[unit_circle_and_complex_plane | complex number]] has two effects: it doubles the angle the number makes with the horizontal axis and squares its length (magnitude) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. If the initial length is the square root of a whole number (e.g., √5 for 2+i), the resulting length after squaring will be a whole number (e.g., 5 for 3+4i) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

This leads to a general formula for [[complex_numbers_and_generating_pythagorean_triples | generating Pythagorean triples]]:
If you start with a [[unit_circle_and_complex_plane | complex number]] `u + vi` where `u` and `v` are integers, squaring it results in `(u² - v²) + (2uv)i` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. The distance from the origin of this new complex number will be `u² + v²` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This gives the triple `(u² - v², 2uv, u² + v²)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

Visualizing the transformation where every point `z` moves to `z²` shows that the grid lines turn into parabolic arcs, and their intersections correspond to [[introduction_to_pythagorean_triples | Pythagorean triples]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. While this method generates many triples, it does not generate all of them directly; for example, it misses multiples like 6-8-10, which is a scaled version of 3-4-5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. To account for all possible [[introduction_to_pythagorean_triples | Pythagorean triples]], one must draw radial lines from the origin through each point generated by squaring [[unit_circle_and_complex_plane | complex numbers]] to include all multiples of those points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

## Unit Circle and Rational Points

The problem of finding [[introduction_to_pythagorean_triples | Pythagorean triples]] can be rephrased as finding points on the [[unit_circle_and_complex_plane | unit circle]] (x² + y² = 1) that have rational coordinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Dividing the equation `a² + b² = c²` by `c²` yields `(a/c)² + (b/c)² = 1`, where `a/c` and `b/c` are rational numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. Conversely, any rational point on the [[unit_circle_and_complex_plane | unit circle]] can be scaled by a common denominator to obtain a point with integer coordinates whose distance from the origin is also an integer, thus forming a [[introduction_to_pythagorean_triples | Pythagorean triple]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

If all the points generated by squaring [[unit_circle_and_complex_plane | complex numbers]] and then projecting them onto the [[unit_circle_and_complex_plane | unit circle]] along their radial lines account for every possible rational point on the [[unit_circle_and_complex_plane | unit circle]], then this method accounts for all [[introduction_to_pythagorean_triples | Pythagorean triples]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

### Proof of Completeness

Consider any rational point `(x,y)` on the [[unit_circle_and_complex_plane | unit circle]] and draw a line between it and the point (-1,0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. The slope of this line will be a rational number because both the "rise" (y - 0) and "run" (x - (-1)) are rational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

When a [[unit_circle_and_complex_plane | complex number]] `u + vi` (with integer `u` and `v`) is squared, its initial angle `theta` with the horizontal axis is doubled to `2*theta` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. This `2*theta` is also the angle of the corresponding rational point on the [[unit_circle_and_complex_plane | unit circle]] after projection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

A geometric property of circles states that the angle subtended by an arc at the center of the circle (`2*theta`) is twice the angle subtended by the same arc at any point on the circumference (`theta`), provided that point is not between the arc's endpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. This means the line connecting (-1,0) to the rational point on the [[unit_circle_and_complex_plane | unit circle]] must have an angle of `theta` with the horizontal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

Crucially, the slope of the line from the origin to our initial complex number `u + vi` is `v/u` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. Since `u` and `v` can be any integers (with `u` not zero), `v/u` can represent every possible rational slope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.
Therefore, the radial lines from the complex number squaring method (determined by all possible `u` and `v`) must pass through every rational point on the [[unit_circle_and_complex_plane | unit circle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. This confirms that this method, when accounting for multiples, can generate every possible [[introduction_to_pythagorean_triples | Pythagorean triple]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

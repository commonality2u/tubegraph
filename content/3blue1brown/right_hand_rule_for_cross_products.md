When calculating the [[introduction_to_cross_products | cross product]] of two three-dimensional vectors, the result is a new three-dimensional vector. This resultant vector's length is equal to the area of the parallelogram spanned by the original two vectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Its direction is perpendicular to the plane containing the parallelogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. However, there are two possible directions perpendicular to any given plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## Determining Direction

The **Right Hand Rule** is used to determine the specific direction of the [[introduction_to_cross_products | cross product]] vector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

To apply the rule:
1.  Point the forefinger of your right hand in the direction of the first vector, **v** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
2.  Extend your middle finger in the direction of the second vector, **w** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
3.  Your thumb will then point in the direction of the [[introduction_to_cross_products | cross product]] (**v** Ã— **w**) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

The resulting vector's direction consistently obeys this rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

## Example Application

Consider two vectors:
*   **v**: a vector with length 2 pointing upwards in the positive z-direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **w**: a vector with length 2 pointing in the positive y-direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

These vectors define a square with an area of 4, since they are perpendicular and have the same length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Thus, their [[introduction_to_cross_products | cross product]] will be a vector with length 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

Applying the Right Hand Rule:
1.  Point your forefinger (v) up the z-axis.
2.  Point your middle finger (w) along the positive y-axis.
3.  Your thumb will point in the negative x-direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

Therefore, the [[introduction_to_cross_products | cross product]] of these two vectors is negative 4 times the i-hat basis vector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

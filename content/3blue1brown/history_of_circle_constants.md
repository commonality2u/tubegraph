The concept of a fundamental circle constant has been a topic of debate in mathematics, particularly concerning the values of pi (π) and tau (τ) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Pi vs. Tau Debate

Traditionally, pi (π) is defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, approximately 3.14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. However, many advocate for tau (τ), which is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its radius, approximately 6.28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, or exactly 2π. The term "tau" was popularized by Michael Hartl's tau manifesto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Robert Palace also proposed a notation for this larger constant: a pi symbol with three legs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

Proponents of tau argue that many mathematical formulas appear cleaner when using it, largely because the number of radians describing a fraction of a circle is simply that fraction of tau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Leonhard Euler's Early Usage

To understand how pi became the standard circle constant, one can examine the notes and letters of [[Mathematical notation and conventions | Leonhard Euler]], one of history's most influential mathematicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Access to his original documents in Euler's hometown was provided by Ben Hambrecht, a 3b1b Switzerland correspondent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Surprisingly, Euler's early writings defined pi as the circumference of a circle whose radius is 1, which corresponds to the 6.28 constant now called tau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. It's likely he used the Greek letter pi as 'p' for perimeter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This initial usage suggests Euler might have been "notationally enlightened" compared to later conventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Standardization of Pi (3.14)

The constant we know as pi (approximately 3.1415) was firmly established as the commonly recognized circle constant by an early calculus book from 1748 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. In Chapter 8 of this book, while describing the semi-circumference of a circle with radius 1 (and after listing 128 digits of its value), the author states, "which for the sake of brevity I may write pi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

While other texts and letters had varying conventions for circle constants, this specific book and section were crucial in spreading the notation throughout Europe and eventually worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The author of this influential work was none other than Euler himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Euler's Flexible Approach to Notation

Further examination of Euler's work reveals instances where he used the symbol pi to represent a quarter turn of a circle, which is now understood as pi/2 or tau/4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Euler's use of the letter pi appears to be more analogous to the modern use of the Greek letter theta (θ) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Just as theta can represent various angles depending on context (e.g., 30 degrees or 135 degrees, or a general variable), Euler allowed pi to represent whatever circle constant best suited the problem he was addressing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

It is worth noting that Euler typically framed problems in terms of [[unit circle and complex plane | unit circles]] with a radius of one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Therefore, the 3.1415 constant was almost always considered the ratio of a circle's semi-circumference to its radius, rather than its circumference to its diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

Euler's prolific output of over 500 books and papers during his lifetime, averaging 800 dense math pages per year, suggests a mind focused on solving problems rather than adhering to rigid notational standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. For him, the choice of circle constant—whether a quarter circle, full circle, or half circle constant—depended on which was most natural for the specific problem at hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

This flexibility highlights a broader lesson in mathematics: the focus should be on solving problems, whether practical or for the sake of knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Questions of notational standards can then be answered with respect to a given context, as different contexts may naturally lead to different preferred conventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Euler's immense contributions to mathematics correlate with a flexible approach to conventions rather than an insistence on objectively "right" standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

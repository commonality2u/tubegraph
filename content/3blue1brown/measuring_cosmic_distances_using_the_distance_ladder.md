Terence Tao, a renowned mathematician, proposed that the story of how humanity first figured out [[distance measurement in the cosmos | cosmic distances]] would benefit from a strongly visual presentation, starting from the size of the Earth and extending up to the universe [00:00:40] [00:00:44]. This "distance ladder" involves each measurement unlocking a path to the next one [00:00:53]. The goal of science communication, particularly concerning [[distance measurement in the cosmos | cosmic distances]], is to demonstrate *how* we know what we know, rather than just presenting facts [00:01:13] [00:01:17].

The sheer, unfathomable [[scale of the universe | scales]] involved in [[distance measurement in the cosmos | cosmic distances]] are awe-striking, but equally deserving of awe is the clever reasoning at each step [00:01:24] [00:01:32]. Often, measuring the distance to an object (X) requires observing how X impacts another object (Y), relying heavily on mathematical principles and available data and technology [00:01:40] [00:01:46] [00:01:51].

## The Earth's Shape: A Celestial Clue

The first step on the distance ladder is determining the radius of the Earth [00:02:02]. This question presumes Earth is roughly spherical [00:02:07]. The ancients deduced the Earth's shape through observations [00:02:10]. A convincing proof came from the Moon [00:02:16]. To measure one object, like the Earth, a reference object some distance away is needed [00:02:23] [00:02:26].

Stuck on Earth, we cannot step back to see its roundness from many angles; from a single angle, it could appear as a flat disc [00:02:30] [00:02:35]. However, if every projection of a convex body is a circle, then it must be a sphere [00:02:41] [00:02:44]. This is intuitive: if every shadow of a shape is a circle, the shape must be a sphere [00:02:51]. While this isn't true in two dimensions (where shapes exist with consistent interval projections that aren't round), in 3D, sufficient perspective exists [00:03:05] [00:03:13].

Aristotle used [[using_lunar_eclipses_to_measure_the_earthmoon_distance | lunar eclipses]] to demonstrate Earth's spherical shape [00:03:22] [00:03:25]. [[using_lunar_eclipses_to_measure_the_earthmoon_distance | Lunar eclipses]] occur when the Moon falls into Earth's shadow [00:03:28]. Earth's shadow, as visibly seen during an eclipse, always forms a circular arc [00:03:31] [00:03:47]. This phenomenon provides visible proof that the Earth is round without needing telescopes, sextants, or spacecraft [00:03:49] [00:03:52].

## Measuring Earth's Radius: Eratosthenes' Ingenuity

The first known person to measure the Earth's radius was Eratosthenes [00:04:08] [00:04:10]. He learned that in Syene, on the summer solstice, the Sun's reflection could be seen directly in a well [00:04:11] [00:04:15]. In his own town, Alexandria, the Sun was not directly overhead at noon on the summer solstice [00:04:24] [00:04:31]. Understanding that the Earth was round, Eratosthenes reasoned that the Sun's rays, being effectively parallel due to the Sun's distance, hit Syene directly but struck Alexandria at an angle [00:04:40] [00:04:47].

On the summer solstice, Earth's rotational axis tilts directly towards the Sun, causing a consistent line of latitude (the Tropic of Cancer, where Syene is located) to experience the Sun directly overhead at high noon [00:05:10] [00:05:14] [00:05:36] [00:05:39]. Alexandria, being further north, experienced the Sun about 7 degrees off the vertical, as measured with a gnomon (an ancient protractor/sundial) [00:05:44] [00:05:48] [00:06:06].

Eratosthenes deduced that the arc length between Alexandria and Syene was about 7 degrees [00:06:09] [00:06:18]. This meant the ratio of 7 degrees to 360 degrees (a full circle) was equivalent to the ratio of the distance between the two towns to the Earth's full circumference [00:06:24] [00:06:28] [00:06:31]. The distance between Syene and Alexandria was estimated at 5000 stadia, roughly 500 miles [00:06:41] [00:06:47]. Eratosthenes' estimate had an accuracy of about 10% [00:07:00]. This sole direct measurement, the distance between two towns, theoretically allowed for the measurement of the entire universe's diameter, although errors would accumulate [00:07:51] [00:07:56] [00:08:00].

## Earth-Moon Distance: Leveraging Eclipses Again

With an understanding of Earth's size, the next logical step is to deduce the distance between the Earth and the Moon [00:08:11] [00:08:14]. [[using_lunar_eclipses_to_measure_the_earthmoon_distance | Eclipses]] are again instrumental, as shadows allow observations from a location different from Earth [00:08:20] [00:08:21] [00:08:24].

During a [[using_lunar_eclipses_to_measure_the_earthmoon_distance | lunar eclipse]], the Earth's shadow is approximately twice the radius of the Earth [00:08:29]. [[using_lunar_eclipses_to_measure_the_earthmoon_distance | Lunar eclipses]] typically last no longer than four hours [00:08:42] [00:08:46]. Knowing that the Moon takes one lunar month (approximately 28 days) to traverse its orbit, ancient astronomers could work out the relationship between the Moon's distance and Earth's radius by comparing these time periods [00:08:49] [00:08:54] [00:08:57].

More precisely, the time the Moon takes to pass through Earth's shadow during an eclipse (about 3.5 hours for the longest eclipses) could be compared to its orbital period [00:09:07] [00:09:17] [00:09:36] [00:09:41]. This ratio, divided by pi, reveals how many Earth radii away the Moon is [00:09:43] [00:09:50]. Aristarchus measured the distance to the Moon to be about 60 Earth radii, which is remarkably accurate, as the actual orbit varies between 58 and 62 radii [00:09:56] [00:09:57] [00:10:00].

## Moon's Size: Observing Its Rise

[[using_lunar_eclipses_to_measure_the_earthmoon_distance | Lunar eclipses]] also reveal the relative size of the Earth and the Moon: the Moon is about a quarter as wide as the Earth [00:10:07] [00:10:12]. However, precise measurement using this visual method is difficult without photography [00:10:15].

The Greeks had another way to deduce the Moon's size [00:10:19]. By observing a full Moon rising, one can measure the time it takes for the entire Moon to appear above the horizon, which is around two minutes [00:10:23] [00:10:27]. This observation is primarily due to Earth's rotation, causing the observer's line of sight to scan across the Moon [00:10:30] [00:10:33] [00:10:36]. Since the Moon appears to cycle around the Earth due to rotation approximately every 24 hours, the ratio of two minutes to 24 hours can be used to work out the ratio between the Moon's radius and its distance from Earth [00:10:40] [00:10:49] [00:10:52]. Knowing the distance to the Moon, this ratio then provides its radius [00:10:57].

Both these ancient estimates for the Moon's size and distance were approximate, as the Moon's orbit is an ellipse, not a perfect circle [00:11:01] [00:11:05]. Nevertheless, they provided decent estimates with almost no technology [00:11:08].

## Early Attempts to Measure the Sun: Successes and Limitations

Measuring the Sun proved trickier [00:11:15]. Ancient astronomers thought the Sun orbited the Earth [00:11:16]. However, for the mathematical argument, the heliocentric or geocentric model doesn't fundamentally change the calculation of the Sun's size and distance [00:11:19] [00:11:21].

[[using_lunar_eclipses_to_measure_the_earthmoon_distance | Eclipses]] again provided a clue: during a solar eclipse, the Moon and the Sun appear to be almost exactly the same size [00:11:27] [00:11:30]. This means the ratio of the Moon's radius to its distance from Earth (determining its apparent size in the sky) is nearly the same as the ratio of the Sun's radius to its distance from Earth [00:11:44] [00:11:49] [00:11:57]. Since the Greeks knew the ratio for the Moon, they could get an approximate sense of the Sun's size if they could determine its distance, and vice versa [00:12:03] [00:12:05] [00:12:09].

The question then became: how far away is the Sun? Aristarchus attempted to determine this using the phases of the Moon [00:12:45] [00:12:50]. The Sun illuminates half of the Moon, and Earth observers see a different half, creating the Moon's phases [00:12:57] [00:13:00] [00:13:06]. This also indirectly proves the Moon is round; if it were flat, phases would not occur [00:13:12] [00:13:14].

A "half Moon" occurs when the Earth and the Sun make a right angle *at the Moon* [00:13:27] [00:13:29] [00:13:41] [00:13:45]. The farther away the Sun is, the closer the half Moon appears to be at the true halfway point between a new Moon and a full Moon [00:14:19] [00:14:23]. By measuring the precise angle separating this halfway point from the actual half Moon, one can quantitatively deduce the distance to the Sun [00:14:27] [00:14:30] [00:14:37]. Specifically, the distance to the Sun is the distance to the Moon divided by the sine of that angle [00:14:43] [00:14:46].

This method was mathematically sound but faced technological [[limitations of cosmic perspective | limitations]] for the Greeks [00:14:53] [00:15:29] [00:15:31] [00:15:34]. Aristarchus estimated the half Moon occurred 6 hours before the midpoint between new and full Moons, which was incorrect; the actual discrepancy is half an hour [00:15:05] [00:15:08] [00:15:15] [00:15:16] [00:15:18]. Ancient astronomers lacked accurate clocks (especially for night observations) and telescopes [00:15:20] [00:15:25] [00:15:27]. Due to this inaccuracy, Aristarchus estimated the Sun to be 20 times further than the Moon and 7 times bigger than the Earth [00:15:36] [00:15:38] [00:15:49] [00:15:53]. The true distances are 370 times the Moon's distance and 109 times Earth's size [00:15:46] [00:15:54].

### Heliocentric Model and the Parallax Problem

Despite the quantitative error, Aristarchus made a crucial qualitative conclusion: the Sun, being so much larger, did not orbit the Earth; instead, Earth should orbit the Sun [00:15:55] [00:16:00] [00:16:04] [00:16:07]. This marked the first proposal of the heliocentric model [00:16:23]. Copernicus later acknowledged Aristarchus in his own famous book [00:16:26] [00:16:28].

However, other Greeks dismissed Aristarchus's heliocentric theory for seemingly good mathematical reasons at the time, also limited by technology [00:16:32] [00:16:34]. They argued that if Earth moved around the Sun, the apparent positions of constellations would shift due to *parallax* [00:16:36] [00:16:40] [00:16:42] [00:16:46]. Parallax causes nearby objects to appear to move faster or shift more significantly than distant objects when an observer moves [00:17:10] [00:17:12]. Since no such shift in stellar patterns was observed through the seasons, it implied that the stars must be vastly further away than they then believed [00:17:48] [00:17:51] [00:17:55] [00:18:00]. To accept Aristarchus's model would mean the universe was thousands of times bigger [00:18:07] [00:18:08]. This dismissal, while logical with the available data, highlights that even correct math doesn't guarantee truth if technology is insufficient, as the universe is indeed billions and trillions of times larger [00:18:13] [00:18:19] [00:18:22].

## Kepler's Genius: Unlocking Orbital Shapes

Jumping forward to Kepler, his work built on Copernicus's contributions [00:18:26] [00:18:45] [00:18:47]. Copernicus had already established that planets orbit the Sun in circular paths and calculated their periods [00:18:52] [00:18:55] [00:18:59]. For example, Earth orbits in one year, Mars in 687 days [00:19:03] [00:19:07] [00:19:11]. These periods, derived from centuries of Babylonian and other [[astronomical_observations_and_their_impact_on_physics | Astronomical observations]] [00:19:22] [00:19:25] [00:19:29], were crucial for Kepler's later work.

Kepler was initially driven by a theory linking planetary orbits to the five Platonic solids, believing the ratios of spheres nested within these solids would match orbital ratios [00:19:38] [00:19:42] [00:20:07] [00:20:11]. To test this, he needed precise historical planetary data [00:20:23] [00:20:26]. He acquired this data from Tycho Brahe, a wealthy aristocrat who had made decades of detailed [[astronomical_observations_and_their_impact_on_physics | observations]] from his observatory, Uraniborg [00:20:30] [00:20:33] [00:20:36] [00:20:43] [00:20:46]. Kepler ultimately "stole" the data, as their relationship was not good [00:20:47] [00:20:51].

Kepler found that neither his theory nor Copernicus's theory (circular orbits) fit Brahe's data [00:20:59] [00:21:01] [00:21:03] [00:21:05]. Abandoning the circular orbit assumption made the observational data incredibly difficult to interpret, as astronomers at the time only knew the apparent direction of planets in the sky, not their absolute distances in 3D space [00:21:09] [00:21:13] [00:21:18] [00:21:24] [00:21:27].

Despite only having a sequence of angles, Kepler managed to deduce the shapes of all planetary orbits, including Earth's [00:21:35] [00:21:38] [00:21:41]. This is what Einstein called an "idea of pure genius" [00:00:02] [00:00:09] [00:01:56] [00:26:52] [00:26:55]. Kepler assumed the Sun was fixed and that both Earth and Mars moved in unknown, non-circular orbits [00:21:44] [00:21:46] [00:21:51] [00:21:54]. The only known information was Earth's direction to the Sun (based on the date) and Mars's direction relative to Earth [00:21:57] [00:22:04] [00:22:13] [00:22:24] [00:22:29].

Kepler's brilliant insight involved a simplification: if Mars were fixed in space, then the two known directions (Earth-Sun and Earth-Mars) would be sufficient to triangulate Earth's position relative to fixed Mars and Sun [00:23:02] [00:23:06] [00:23:07] [00:23:09] [00:23:16] [00:23:20] [00:23:22] [00:23:28]. This would allow plotting Earth's orbit relative to these fixed points, though without absolute distances [00:23:31] [00:23:36] [00:23:45].

The genius lay in how to "fix" a moving Mars [00:23:54] [00:23:56] [00:23:59]. From Copernicus, Kepler knew that Mars returns to the same point in its orbit every 687 days (the Martian year) [00:24:00] [00:24:04] [00:24:08]. By selecting Brahe's observations that were precisely 687 days apart, Kepler could treat Mars as a fixed reference point for those specific moments in time [00:24:10] [00:24:15] [00:24:29] [00:24:36]. Tycho Brahe's 10 years of data provided five such opportunities to observe Earth's location relative to the same point in Mars's orbit [00:24:20] [00:24:24] [00:24:44].

By piecing together these "jigsaw puzzle" data sets, each representing Earth's positions relative to a specific (but unknown) Martian location, Kepler was able to reconstruct a coherent orbit for Earth relative to a coherent orbit for Mars [00:25:24] [00:25:28] [00:25:34] [00:25:38] [00:25:41]. This revealed that Earth's orbit was an ellipse, not a circle [00:25:47] [00:25:52] [00:25:55]. He also discovered his second law: Earth sweeps out equal areas in equal times along its elliptical orbit [00:25:59] [00:26:03]. Once Earth's orbit's shape was known, deducing the orbits of Mars and other planets became easier [00:26:07] [00:26:09] [00:26:13]. By reversing the method (using Earth's known orbit as the reference), Kepler could then work out Mars's orbit [00:26:18] [00:26:25] [00:26:29] [00:26:40] [00:26:44].

This process provided the *shapes* of planetary orbits and their relative sizes, but not absolute distances [00:27:16] [00:27:19] [00:27:23]. The scale of the solar system remained a mystery; they had the picture but not the size of the paper it was drawn on [00:27:26] [00:27:28] [00:27:31]. Astronomers then sought a precise way to measure just one absolute distance within the solar system, which would allow them to lock all other distances into place [00:27:36] [00:27:39] [00:27:41] [00:27:44].

The next step would involve using an accurate measure for the Earth-Sun distance to deduce the [[historical_speed_of_light_measurements | speed of light]], the distance to the nearest stars, and ultimately the distance to the farthest observable galaxies [00:27:50] [00:27:54] [00:27:56] [00:27:59].

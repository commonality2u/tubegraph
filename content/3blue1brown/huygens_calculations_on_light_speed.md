The observation of Jupiter's moons proved pivotal in one of physics' most significant discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Specifically, the moon [[ios_orbit_and_light_speed_discovery | Io]] provided crucial insights.

## Io's Eclipses and Apparent Irregularities

[[ios_orbit_and_light_speed_discovery | Io]] regularly enters Jupiter's shadow, dimming as it falls into darkness and brightening upon emergence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. By observing this phenomenon through a telescope, one can precisely mark the time [[ios_orbit_and_light_speed_discovery | Io]] reappears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Initially, these reappearances seemed to occur with clockwork regularity, at 42-hour intervals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

However, further observation revealed that the timing was not consistent throughout the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. At different times, [[ios_orbit_and_light_speed_discovery | Io]] would appear either ahead or behind schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. When Earth was on the same side of the Sun as Jupiter, [[ios_orbit_and_light_speed_discovery | Io]]'s emergence was observed 20 minutes earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Conversely, when Earth was on the opposite side of Jupiter, it took 20 minutes longer to observe the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This constituted a measurable delay in the observed [[ios_orbit_and_light_speed_discovery | orbit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Huygens' Breakthrough

After precise calculations based on these observations, Christiaan Huygens realized that this delay was not due to an irregularity in [[ios_orbit_and_light_speed_discovery | Io]]'s orbit, but rather because light itself was taking 20 minutes to traverse an additional distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This extra distance amounted to approximately two [[impact_of_astronomical_units_on_light_speed | astronomical units]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Significance of the Discovery

At the time of Huygens' work, the precise value of the [[impact_of_astronomical_units_on_light_speed | astronomical unit]] was not yet known, which meant that early [[historical_estimations_of_light_speed | estimations of the speed of light]] derived from this method were not particularly impressive by modern standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Crucially, before this discovery, it was not even widely accepted that light possessed a finite speed, as it appeared instantaneous in most Earth-bound experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. However, when viewed on [[distance_measurement_in_the_cosmos | astronomical scales]], light's speed becomes demonstrably finite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

This clever method, although imprecise in its initial quantification, laid the essential groundwork for more refined experiments on Earth, providing the first rough sense of light's true velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

This article explores the fundamental connection between [[fourier_series_and_their_relation_to_the_heat_equation | Fourier series]] and the [[introduction_to_partial_differential_equations_and_the_heat_equation | heat equation]], a pivotal [[introduction_to_partial_differential_equations_and_the_heat_equation | partial differential equation]] (PDE) in physics and mathematics.

## Introduction to the Heat Equation

The [[introduction_to_partial_differential_equations_and_the_heat_equation | heat equation]] is a [[introduction_to_partial_differential_equations_and_the_heat_equation | partial differential equation]] that describes how heat distributes across an object over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Imagine a piece of metal with a known heat distribution at a specific moment; the equation predicts how this distribution will change as heat flows from warmer to cooler areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. For a one-dimensional example, consider two rods at different uniform temperatures brought into contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Heat will flow from the hot rod to the cool one, gradually equalizing the temperature across the combined object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The heat equation precisely describes this temperature distribution at each point in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Like other [[introduction_to_partial_differential_equations_and_the_heat_equation | differential equations]], the approach is to describe how the system changes from moment to moment, rather than attempting to directly predict the full evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This rule of change is expressed using derivatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

The [[introduction_to_partial_differential_equations_and_the_heat_equation | heat equation]] is significant because its variations appear in many other areas of mathematics and physics, including Brownian motion, the Black-Scholes equations in finance, and various diffusion processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. While [[introduction_to_partial_differential_equations_and_the_heat_equation | partial differential equations]] (PDEs) are generally more challenging to solve than ordinary differential equations (ODEs) due to modeling infinitely many values changing in concert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, the heat equation is one that can actually be solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## The Heat Equation and Fourier Series

The [[applications_of_fourier_series_in_heat_distribution | Fourier series]] concept arose directly from attempts to solve this physical problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Joseph Fourier developed these mathematical tools while trying to understand heat flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### A Hint of the Connection: Complex Fourier Series

A beautiful connection exists between [[complex_fourier_series_and_rotating_vectors | complex Fourier series and rotating vectors]] and the physics of heat flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. [[complex_fourier_series_and_rotating_vectors | Complex Fourier series]] involve conceptualizing many small rotating vectors, each spinning at a constant integer frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. When these vectors are added together tip-to-tail, they can trace out an arbitrary shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. While a finite number of vectors may not perfectly replicate a target shape, increasing the number of circles yields increasingly accurate approximations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. By merely adjusting the initial size and angle of each vector, it's possible to approximate any desired curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The mathematical principles enabling this visual phenomenon are precisely the same as those describing the physics of heat flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Understanding the Heat Equation

To construct the [[introduction_to_partial_differential_equations_and_the_heat_equation | heat equation]], we first define the function being analyzed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. For a one-dimensional rod, points are labeled along an x-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The temperature is a function of position, T(x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Since temperature changes over time, it also depends on time, T(x, t) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This means the input space for the temperature function is two-dimensional (space and time), with temperature graphed as a surface above it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### Partial Derivatives

Because the temperature function has multiple input dimensions (space and time), there are multiple rates of change involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>:

*   **Derivative with respect to x**: How rapidly temperature changes as you move along the rod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. This can be visualized as the slope of the temperature surface when sliced parallel to the x-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Derivative with respect to t**: The rate at which the temperature of a single point on the rod changes over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. This is the slope of the surface when sliced parallel to the time axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

Each of these derivatives tells only part of the story, so they are called [[mathematical_analysis_of_fourier_series | partial derivatives]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. The notation for partial derivatives uses a special curly 'D', sometimes called "del" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Conceptually, a derivative can be thought of as a ratio between a small change in the function's output and the small change in the input that caused it, taken as a limit for smaller and smaller input nudges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. This applies to [[mathematical_analysis_of_fourier_series | partial derivatives]] just as much as ordinary derivatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

The [[introduction_to_partial_differential_equations_and_the_heat_equation | heat equation]] is expressed using these [[mathematical_analysis_of_fourier_series | partial derivatives]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. It states that the function's rate of change with respect to time depends on its rate of change with respect to space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Specifically, it's proportional to the second [[mathematical_analysis_of_fourier_series | partial derivative]] with respect to x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. This means that points where the temperature distribution curves tend to change more quickly in the direction of that curvature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Deriving the Heat Equation: From Discrete to Continuous

To understand the origin of the [[introduction_to_partial_differential_equations_and_the_heat_equation | heat equation]], consider a discrete version of the setup: a finite number of points in a row, each with a temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. The fundamental principle is that if a point's two neighbors are, on average, hotter than it is, it will heat up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. If they are cooler, it will cool down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. The speed of heating or cooling is proportional to this temperature difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

Formally, the derivative of a point's temperature (T2) with respect to time is proportional to the difference between the average of its neighbors (T1 and T3) and its own value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This can be rearranged as:
`dT2/dt ∝ ½ * [(T1 - T2) - (T2 - T3)]` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
The term `(T1 - T2)` represents a difference, and `(T2 - T3)` represents another difference. The expression thus becomes the "difference of the differences" or a **second difference** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. This indicates how much a point's temperature differs from the average of its neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. The rate of change for a point's temperature is proportional to this second difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

### From Second Difference to Second Derivative (Laplacian)

As we transition from this finite, discrete context to an infinite, continuous case, the analog of a second difference is the **second derivative** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Instead of discrete differences, we consider the rate of change of temperature per unit distance, as the step size approaches zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

In calculus, this is written as `∂²T/∂x²`, the second [[mathematical_analysis_of_fourier_series | partial derivative]] of the temperature function with respect to x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. A key intuition for second derivatives is that they measure how a value compares to the average of its neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. Points where the graph curves upwards have a positive second derivative, indicating an increasing slope, while points curving downwards have a negative second derivative, indicating a decreasing slope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. The heat equation implies that curved points tend to flatten out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

For objects spread out in more than one dimension (e.g., a plate or a 3D body), the [[introduction_to_partial_differential_equations_and_the_heat_equation | heat equation]] is similar but includes second derivatives with respect to all spatial directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. The sum of these second spatial derivatives is known as the **Laplacian**, often denoted by `∇²` (an upside-down triangle squared) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. The Laplacian is essentially a multivariable version of the second derivative and still provides the intuition of measuring how a point differs from the average of its neighbors, but now considering neighbors in all directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

## PDEs vs. ODEs

This [[introduction_to_partial_differential_equations_and_the_heat_equation | partial differential equation]] for heat flow describes infinitely many values changing in a continuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Each value's change depends on its immediate neighbors in a limiting sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. The relation on the right-hand side of the equation is a spatial derivative, not a sum or product of other numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. In essence, a single [[introduction_to_partial_differential_equations_and_the_heat_equation | partial differential equation]] like the [[introduction_to_partial_differential_equations_and_the_heat_equation | heat equation]] can be seen as a system of infinitely many equations, one for each point on the rod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. This contrasts with ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which typically describe the change of a handful of numbers (e.g., coordinates of objects under gravity), where the rate of change of one value depends on the values of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

## Conclusion

Understanding [[introduction_to_partial_differential_equations_and_the_heat_equation | partial differential equations]] like the [[introduction_to_partial_differential_equations_and_the_heat_equation | heat equation]] is a powerful addition to one's mathematical vocabulary for describing the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. The methods developed by Fourier to solve this problem, specifically [[fourier_series_and_sine_waves | Fourier series]], represent a satisfying piece of mathematics that will be explored further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. The core idea of constructing solutions to complex real-world problems from simple idealized building blocks is central to Fourier's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.

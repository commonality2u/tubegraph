The evolution of mathematical notation, particularly for constants like pi (π), reveals a fascinating history of convention and flexibility among mathematicians. The debate surrounding pi (π) versus tau (τ) highlights ongoing discussions about what constitutes the most fundamental circle constant.

## The Pi vs. Tau Debate

The constant we commonly know as pi (π) is defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, approximately 3.14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. An alternative constant, often called tau (τ), is proposed as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its radius, approximately 6.28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

The use of tau was popularized by Michael Hartle's tau manifesto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Proponents argue that many mathematical formulas appear cleaner when using tau, largely because the number of radians describing a given fraction of a circle is simply that fraction of tau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Robert Palace even proposed a unique notation for tau: a pi symbol with three legs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## [[Leonhard Eulers role in mathematical constants | Euler]]'s Flexible Approach to Pi

To understand how pi as 3.14 became the standard, it's fruitful to examine the historical notes and letters of influential mathematicians, such as [[Leonhard Eulers role in mathematical constants | Leonhard Euler]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Access to [[Leonhard Eulers role in mathematical constants | Euler]]'s original documents, facilitated by 3b1brown Switzerland correspondent Ben Hambrecht, reveals an unexpected usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Initially, [[Leonhard Eulers role in mathematical constants | Euler]] defined "pi" as the circumference of a circle whose radius is 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This value, approximately 6.28, is what we now call tau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. It's likely he used the Greek letter pi as an abbreviation for "perimeter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Standardization of Pi (3.14)

The widespread adoption of pi (π) as 3.14 was primarily established by [[Leonhard Eulers role in mathematical constants | Euler]] himself, in his early calculus book published in 1748 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. In Chapter 8, when describing the semi-circumference of a circle with radius 1 (which is 3.14...), [[Leonhard Eulers role in mathematical constants | Euler]] stated, "which for the sake of brevity I may write pi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This specific section of the book was instrumental in spreading this notation throughout Europe and eventually the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

Despite this, [[Leonhard Eulers role in mathematical constants | Euler]]'s usage of the symbol pi was highly flexible. He sometimes used pi to represent a quarter turn of a circle (what we call pi/2 or tau/4 today) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. His approach was more akin to how we use the Greek letter theta (θ) to represent a variable angle, not a fixed value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. [[Leonhard Eulers role in mathematical constants | Euler]] would let pi represent whatever circle constant best suited the problem he was solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Notably, he typically framed problems in terms of unit circles with a radius of one, so the 3.14 constant was usually conceived as the ratio of a circle's semi-circumference to its radius, rather than its circumference to its diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## A Lesson in Mathematical Flexibility

[[Leonhard Eulers role in mathematical constants | Euler]]'s work ethic was prolific; he solved a vast number of problems, producing over 500 books and papers during his lifetime, at a rate of 800 dense math pages per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. His focus was on solving the immediate task at hand, not on debating which circle constant was the most fundamental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Depending on the problem, the quarter-circle constant, the full-circle constant, or the half-circle constant might be most natural to consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

This historical perspective offers a general lesson for approaching [[mathematics in nature | mathematics]]:
- **Focus on problems, not rigid standards**: In [[mathematics in nature | math]] education, there is often too much emphasis on which of multiple competing views is "right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. However, questions like "Is it correct to say that the sum of all positive integers is negative 1/12th, or is it correct to say that it diverges to infinity?" or "Can infinitesimal values of calculus be taken literally, or is it only correct to speak in terms of limits?" are not crucial in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
- **Context matters**: The focus should be on solving specific problems and puzzles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. When questions of standards arise, they should be answered with respect to a given context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Different contexts will naturally lead to different answers for what seems most natural <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

[[Leonhard Eulers role in mathematical constants | Euler]]'s immense output and transformative insights were correlated with his flexibility towards conventions, rather than a rigid focus on which standards were objectively correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This suggests that adaptability in notation and conventions can foster deeper engagement with the mathematical challenges themselves.

The [[the_heat_equation_and_its_applications|heat equation]] is a partial differential equation (PDE) that describes how heat is distributed across an object and how that distribution changes over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. It addresses questions like predicting the temperature at every point of a metal plate over time, given its initial heat distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Similar questions arise when considering two rods at different temperatures brought into contact, where heat flows from warmer to cooler areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

Like other [[ordinary_differential_equations|ordinary differential equations]], the [[the_heat_equation_and_its_applications|heat equation]] describes how a setup changes from moment to moment, using the language of [[understanding_the_meaning_and_computation_of_derivatives|derivatives]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Defining the Temperature Function
For a one-dimensional object like a rod, its points can be labeled along an x-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The temperature at any point on the rod is a function of its position `x` and time `t`, often denoted as `T(x, t)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This function can be visualized as a surface in a 3D graph where one axis represents space, another time, and the third temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### Partial Derivatives
Since the temperature function has multiple input dimensions (space and time), there are different rates of change at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>:
*   **Derivative with respect to x (space)**: This describes how rapidly the temperature changes as one moves along the rod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. It represents the slope of the temperature surface when sliced parallel to the x-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Derivative with respect to t (time)**: This describes the rate at which the temperature of a single point on the rod changes over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. It's the slope of the surface when sliced parallel to the time axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

Because each of these [[understanding_the_meaning_and_computation_of_derivatives|derivatives]] only tells part of the story, they are called **partial derivatives** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. The notation for partial derivatives replaces the letter 'D' with a curly 'D', often called 'del' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Conceptually, partial derivatives are similar to ordinary [[understanding_the_meaning_and_computation_of_derivatives|derivatives]], representing the limit of a ratio between a small change in the function's output and the small change in the input that caused it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

### The Heat Equation and Second Partial Derivatives
The [[the_heat_equation_and_its_applications|heat equation]] relates these partial derivatives: the way the temperature function changes with respect to time depends on how it changes with respect to space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Specifically, it is proportional to the **second partial derivative with respect to x** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

In simple terms, at points where the temperature distribution curves, it tends to change more quickly in the direction of that curvature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. A rule expressed using partial derivatives is called a partial differential equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

### Derivation from a Discrete Case (Second Difference)
The intuition behind the second derivative in the [[the_heat_equation_and_its_applications|heat equation]] can be understood by considering a discrete version of the problem, where there are a finite number of points on the rod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   For a specific point, if its two neighbors are, on average, hotter than it is, it will heat up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. If they are cooler, it will cool down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   The rate of change for the temperature of a point (T2) is proportional to the difference between the average of its neighbors (T1 and T3) and its own value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   This difference, `((T1 + T3)/2) - T2`, can be rewritten as `(T3 - T2) - (T2 - T1)`, which is a "difference of differences" or **second difference** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   If the first differences (`T2 - T1` and `T3 - T2`) are equal, then the central point `T2` is already the average of its neighbors and will not change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. If the second difference is positive, `T2` is lower than the average of its neighbors and will increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Conversely, a negative second difference means `T2` will decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
*   In the continuous case, the analog of a second difference is the **second derivative** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. It measures how the rate of change itself changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. The second partial derivative `∂²T/∂x²` signifies how a value compares to the average of its neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

The [[the_heat_equation_and_its_applications|heat equation]], `∂T/∂t ∝ ∂²T/∂x²`, intuitively states that "curved points tend to flatten out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, driven by each point tending towards the average of its neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

### Comparison to Ordinary Differential Equations
While [[ordinary_differential_equations|ordinary differential equations]] typically analyze a handful of changing numbers (like coordinates of objects under gravity), partial differential equations like the [[the_heat_equation_and_its_applications|heat equation]] model infinitely many values changing in a continuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. In PDEs, the change of any one value depends on its immediate neighbors, expressed through spatial [[understanding_the_meaning_and_computation_of_derivatives|derivatives]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. The [[the_heat_equation_and_its_applications|heat equation]] can be seen as a system of infinitely many equations, one for each point on the rod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

### Generalization to Higher Dimensions: The Laplacian
For objects in two or three dimensions (like a plate), the [[the_heat_equation_and_its_applications|heat equation]] includes second [[understanding_the_meaning_and_computation_of_derivatives|derivatives]] with respect to all spatial directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. The sum of these second spatial [[understanding_the_meaning_and_computation_of_derivatives|derivatives]] is known as the **Laplacian** (often denoted by an upside-down triangle squared) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. The Laplacian is a multivariable version of the second derivative, and it maintains the intuition of measuring how different a point is from the average of all its surrounding neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

### Significance
Understanding how to read a PDE like the [[the_heat_equation_and_its_applications|heat equation]] and the role of its [[understanding_the_meaning_and_computation_of_derivatives|derivatives]] is a powerful addition to one's vocabulary for describing the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. This specific equation is notably solvable, and its solution paved the way for the development of [[fourier_series_in_solving_heat_equations|Fourier series]] by Joseph Fourier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

Bell's inequalities are a significant [[quantum_mechanics_basics_for_beginners | quantum mechanical]] topic described as mind-warping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Despite their profound implications, the underlying mathematics is surprisingly simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. A video on this topic was produced in collaboration with Henry from MinutePhysics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

The discussion of Bell's inequalities often involves experiments with polarizing filters, demonstrating how the behavior of photons challenges classical expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. Specifically, the observed probabilities when light passes through multiple polarizing filters set at various angles become "weirder" when considering the specific probabilities for angles between 0 and 45 degrees, which is a key focus of the Bell's inequalities video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

## Introduction
Bell's inequalities are a "mind-warping" topic in [[polarization_and_superposition_in_quantum_mechanics | quantum mechanics]] that are not widely known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This topic serves as a useful foundation for deeper learning in the field of [[polarization_and_superposition_in_quantum_mechanics | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Mathematical Foundation
Despite being a [[polarization_and_superposition_in_quantum_mechanics | quantum]] concept, Bell's inequalities are based on surprisingly simple mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Connection to Photon Polarization and Measurement
The understanding of Bell's inequalities can be enhanced by considering experiments involving polarizing filters and photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.
A demonstration involves holding two polarizing sunglasses rotated 90 degrees off from each other, which typically blocks out a light source entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. This is because photons passing through the first filter are polarized, giving them a 0% chance of passing a filter oriented horizontally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.
However, inserting a third filter oriented at a 45-degree angle between the first two allows more light to pass through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. This phenomenon occurs because 50% of the photons passing the vertical filter will also pass through the diagonal filter, and once they do, their polarization is changed to be purely diagonal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. In this new state, they then have a 50-50 chance of passing through the filter oriented at 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. This means that 25% of the photons now pass through all three filters, which cannot be explained unless the middle filter forces the photons to change their states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.

The specific probabilities for angles between 0 and 45 degrees further illustrate this phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. For example, considering a photon whose [[polarization_and_superposition_in_quantum_mechanics | polarization]] is 22.5 degrees off the direction of a filter, if the wave has an amplitude of 1, its horizontal component would have an amplitude of approximately 0.38 (sin 22.5 degrees), and its vertical component would have an amplitude of approximately 0.92 (cos 22.5 degrees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. Classically, passing this through a vertical filter would mean 15% of its energy is absorbed in the horizontal direction (0.38 squared is 0.15) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. However, due to the quantized nature of light, either 85% of the time the photon passes through entirely, or 15% of the time it gets completely blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

## Further Exploration
A video by Henry from MinutePhysics and the speaker discusses Bell's inequalities and these specific probabilities in more detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

The **Convolution Theorem** is a fundamental concept in mathematics, particularly in the fields of Fourier analysis and signal processing. It provides a crucial link between the operations of multiplication and convolution when functions are transformed between different domains via the Fourier Transform. This theorem offers a powerful method for solving complex problems by shifting perspective, often making intricate calculations simpler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

## The Sinc Function Integral Mystery

The practical significance of the Convolution Theorem can be illustrated by a peculiar mathematical phenomenon involving integrals of the sinc function. The `sinc` function is defined as `sine(x)/x` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. While `x=0` appears to be an issue, the function approaches 1 as `x` approaches 0, allowing for a continuous definition where `sinc(0) = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

Consider a sequence of integrals involving `sinc` functions:
1.  The integral of `sinc(x)` from negative infinity to infinity equals exactly `pi` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
2.  Multiplying `sinc(x)` by `sinc(x/3)` and integrating also yields `pi` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
3.  Continuing this pattern, multiplying by `sinc(x/5)`, `sinc(x/7)`, `sinc(x/9)`, `sinc(x/11)`, and `sinc(x/13)` still results in `pi` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
4.  However, when the next factor, `sinc(x/15)`, is included, the integral surprisingly breaks the pattern, yielding a value *just barely less than pi* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This exact value is a complex fraction of pi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

This pattern, described by Jonathan and David Borwein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, was initially mistaken for a bug in computer algebra systems due to its unexpected stability and minute deviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. The phenomenon becomes even stranger when an additional factor of `2 cos(x)` is included in the integrals. In this case, the pattern of equaling `pi` continues much longer, breaking only when the factor `sinc(x/113)` is introduced, again by an incredibly subtle amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## The Analogous Moving Average Process

To understand this, consider a seemingly unrelated process involving a "rectangle" function, `rect(x)`, defined as 1 for `x` between -1/2 and 1/2, and 0 otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Let this be `f1(x)`.

A sequence of new functions (`f2(x)`, `f3(x)`, etc.) is generated by taking a [[Understanding Convolution | moving average]] of the previous function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>:
*   `f2(x)` is the [[Understanding Convolution | moving average]] of `f1(x)` using a window of width 1/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This results in a new function `f2(x)` that also has a plateau where its value is 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, but this plateau is narrower, specifically `1 - 1/3` in width <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. The value `f2(0)` is 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   `f3(x)` is the [[Understanding Convolution | moving average]] of `f2(x)` using a window of width 1/5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Its plateau width becomes `1 - 1/3 - 1/5` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>, and `f3(0)` is still 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   This process continues with window widths of 1/7, 1/9, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The plateau continually shrinks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

The values `f_n(0)` remain exactly 1 as long as the cumulative sum of the reciprocals of the odd numbers (`1/3 + 1/5 + 1/7 + ...`) remains less than the initial plateau width (which is 1). The point where this pattern breaks is when the sum becomes greater than 1, which occurs when `1/15` is added to the sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. At this point, the plateau "disappears" (becomes thinner than the moving average window), and `f_n(0)` becomes slightly less than 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

This mirrors the `sinc` integral pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. In the case where the `2 cos(x)` term is added, it corresponds to starting with a `rect` function with an initial plateau of width 2 (from -1 to 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. In this scenario, it takes much longer for the sum of reciprocals to exceed the initial plateau width, specifically until the sum exceeds 2, which occurs when `1/113` is added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

## The Role of Fourier Transforms and the Convolution Theorem

The crucial insight is that these two seemingly disparate phenomena are, in fact, "two distinct ways of computing exactly the same thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. The connection is made through the Fourier Transform and the Convolution Theorem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

The Fourier Transform converts a function into a representation in the "frequency domain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. For example, the `sinc(pi*x)` function (a normalized version of `sinc(x)` with an area of 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>) is related to the `rect(x)` function via a Fourier Transform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Stretching `sinc(x)` by a factor `k` corresponds to stretching and squishing `rect(x)` in the Fourier domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

Two key facts from Fourier analysis bridge the gap:

1.  **Integral to Evaluation at Zero**: The integral of a function from negative infinity to infinity is equivalent to evaluating its Fourier transformed version at the input zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.
    *   This explains why the integral of `sinc(pi*x)` is 1: because `rect(0) = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

2.  **The [[Convolution theorem and its mathematical significance | Convolution Theorem]]**: When two functions are multiplied in the original domain, their Fourier transforms are combined through an operation called convolution in the frequency domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.
    *   Crucially, for the specific rectangular functions discussed, a convolution operation is mathematically equivalent to the [[Understanding Convolution | moving average]] process described earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

Therefore, multiplying successive `sinc` functions (e.g., `sinc(x) * sinc(x/3) * sinc(x/5)`) in the original domain corresponds to performing successive convolutions (which are like [[Understanding Convolution | moving averages]]) of their respective `rect` function equivalents in the Fourier domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. The initial integral value of `pi` (or 1 for `sinc(pi*x)`) is maintained as long as the "plateau" of the convolved `rect` function remains wide enough to encompass zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. Once the cumulative "eating away" by the moving averages (convolutions) causes the plateau around zero to shrink past a critical point, the value at zero (and thus the integral) drops slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

## Broader Significance

The Convolution Theorem, often mentioned alongside Fourier Transforms, offers a systematic way to shift perspective on mathematical problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. It allows hard problems involving multiplication in one domain to be simplified by transforming them into easier problems involving convolution in another domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

Beyond this specific esoteric integral problem, the [[Convolution theorem and its mathematical significance | Convolution Theorem]] is widely applicable in various fields:
*   **Signal Processing**: Crucial for understanding filtering, blurring, and other signal modifications.
*   **Image Processing**: Used in tasks like image sharpening, blurring, and edge detection, which often involve [[applications_of_convolution_in_probability_and_image_processing | convolution]] operations.
*   **Probability Theory**: In probability, the probability distribution of the sum of two independent random variables is the [[applications_of_convolution_in_probability_and_image_processing | convolution]] of their individual probability distributions.
*   **Polynomial Multiplication**: It enables algorithms, such as the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based multiplication, to compute the product of two large numbers or polynomials significantly faster than traditional methods, which can be thought of as a [[use_of_convolution_in_polynomial_multiplication | discrete convolution algorithm]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

The elegant connection between the `sinc` function integrals and the [[Understanding Convolution | moving average]] process serves as a compelling example of the power and beauty of the [[Convolution theorem and its mathematical significance | Convolution Theorem]] and Fourier analysis in revealing hidden mathematical structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.

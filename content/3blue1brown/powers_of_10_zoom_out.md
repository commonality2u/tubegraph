A "powers of 10 zoom out" is an animation technique that visually demonstrates the [[scale_of_the_universe | Scale of the Universe]] by zooming out by a factor of 10 at regular intervals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In one notable example, a zoom out by a factor of 10 occurred every 3 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Creation and Purpose

This specific animation was created by Paul D'Step as part of a pair of videos detailing how the distances to various objects in the cosmos are determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Strengths and Weaknesses

While effective in some aspects, these types of zoom outs have both benefits and limitations:

### Strengths

*   **Illustrating Vast Emptiness:** The animation effectively shows the many seemingly blank orders of magnitude between the solar system and the first visible star <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

### Weaknesses and Risks

*   **Underselling Scale:** Such animations can risk underselling the true [[scale_of_the_universe | Scale of the Universe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Implied Speed:** The implied camera position moves vastly faster than the cosmic speed limit, the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This can make distant objects, like other galaxies, appear almost accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, even though it would take approximately 2.5 million years to reach the nearest galaxy traveling at the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Scientific Accuracy and Data Visualization

Efforts were made to maintain scientific accuracy in the animation's conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Rather than resorting to artistic renditions of the universe, the animation concluded with a simple point cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This data was pulled from the Sloan Galactic Survey, which maps the distances to various galaxies across many different directions in the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

The ability to map and study patterns like the clusters and strands formed by billions of galaxies, despite their immense distances (millions and billions of light-years away), is considered a "mindboggling testament to the powers of Science and deduction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

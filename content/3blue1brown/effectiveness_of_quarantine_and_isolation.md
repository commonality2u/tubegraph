Epidemic simulations demonstrate that identifying and isolating infectious individuals is the most effective strategy for halting disease spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. These models, often based on the [[mathematical_modeling_of_epidemics | SIR model]], categorize populations into Susceptible, Infectious, and Recovered states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

## How Isolation Works in Simulations

In simulations, isolation is modeled by sending infected individuals to a separate location one day after they contract the infection, once a critical threshold of cases is reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. This represents real-world isolation efforts, which do not literally involve moving sick people into a single space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>. Unsurprisingly, this measure immediately halts the epidemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.

## Impact of Imperfect Isolation

However, the effectiveness of isolation can be significantly compromised if some infectious cases are not identified and quarantined.

### Unnoticed Cases (e.g., Asymptomatic)
If a percentage of infected individuals, for example, 20%, are not quarantined because they show no symptoms and are not tested, the epidemic's progression changes considerably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>. While the peak number of simultaneous cases might only be slightly higher, the disease develops a very long, low tail, taking much longer to eradicate, ultimately resulting in about twice the total number of cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>.

When applied to simulations with multiple communities and inter-community travel, leaky quarantining still flattens the curve but leads to a much thicker tail and takes significantly longer to track down all cases, resulting in over half the population becoming infected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.

### Partial Isolation
If only 50% of infectious cases are isolated, the situation is only marginally better than if no action had been taken at all, due to the large number of agents still spreading the disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>.

> "Changes in how many people slip through the tests can cause disproportionately large changes to the total number of people infected." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>

## Importance of Early Detection and Treatment

The high effectiveness of quickly containing cases early in an epidemic has an interesting corollary: more lethal diseases can be less dangerous globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>. If a disease kills its host rapidly (e.g., within one day of infection), it prevents further spread, making it terrible for those infected but contained in a broader sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.

The most dangerous viruses are those that are lethal to some but remain unnoticed and spreadable among others, or worse, remain unnoticed and spreadable in everyone before eventually becoming lethal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>. For example, the SARS outbreak in 2002 was well-contained because most infectious individuals showed symptoms, making them easier to identify and isolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.

The simulations also highlight the value of early treatment. An antiviral therapeutic that quickly moves people out of the infectious category has the same model effect as isolating cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.

## Broader Implications

While [[impact_of_social_distancing_and_hygiene_on_disease_spread | social distancing]] is crucial when needed and saves lives, its effectiveness is disproportionately undermined by non-compliance or continued frequent visits to [[role_of_central_locations_in_spreading_disease | central locations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:51:00">[20:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:56:00">[20:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00:00">[21:00:00]</a>. The uncomfortable truth is that if no measures are in place to contain cases, even if few, a second wave will occur as people return to normal life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:06:00">[21:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:09:00">[21:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:13:00">[21:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a>.

The overall takeaway from these simulations is a deeper appreciation for effective disease control, particularly the [[importance_of_early_testing_and_contact_tracing | inordinate value of early widespread testing]] and the ability to isolate cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:21:00">[21:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:26:00">[21:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>. This also includes the role of therapeutics in treating cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:36:00">[21:36:00]</a>.

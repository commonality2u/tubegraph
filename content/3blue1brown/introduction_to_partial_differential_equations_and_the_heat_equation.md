## Understanding Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)

After considering [[introduction_to_ordinary_and_partial_differential_equations | ordinary differential equations]] (ODEs), mathematics turns to [[introduction_to_ordinary_and_partial_differential_equations | partial differential equations]] (PDEs), exemplified by the [[heat_equation_in_onedimensional_case | heat equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. While [[introduction_to_ordinary_and_partial_differential_equations | ODEs]] typically model systems where a handful of numbers change over time, [[solving_partial_differential_equations | PDEs]] are used when an entire function changes over time, involving infinitely many values changing in concert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This complexity generally makes [[solving_partial_differential_equations | PDEs]] much harder to [[solving_partial_differential_equations | solve]] than [[introduction_to_ordinary_and_partial_differential_equations | ODEs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### The Heat Equation: An Overview

The [[heat_equation_in_onedimensional_case | heat equation]] describes how heat is distributed across an object and how this distribution changes over time as heat flows from warmer to cooler spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Variations of the [[heat_equation_in_onedimensional_case | heat equation]] appear in various fields, including Brownian motion, Black-Scholes equations in finance, and different diffusion processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Modeling Heat Flow: The One-Dimensional Case

To illustrate, consider a [[heat_equation_in_onedimensional_case | one-dimensional case]] like a rod positioned along an x-axis, where each point `x` has a temperature `T` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Since the temperature changes over time, the function should have an additional input `t` for time, making temperature `T(x, t)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This function can be visualized as a surface over a two-dimensional input space of space and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

An example involves two rods at different uniform temperatures brought into contact, where heat flows from the hotter to the cooler rod, tending to equalize the temperature over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The question then becomes: what will the temperature distribution be at each point in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>?

## Partial Derivatives: The Language of PDEs

Similar to [[differential_equations_as_a_language_of_physics | differential equations]], the approach is to describe how the system changes from moment to moment rather than jumping to a full evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Because the temperature function has multiple input dimensions (space and time), there are multiple rates of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

*   **Derivative with respect to x:** How rapidly temperature changes as you move along the rod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Derivative with respect to t:** The rate at which a single point's temperature changes with time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

These are called partial derivatives, indicated by the special curly 'D' notation (del) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. They represent the ratio of a small change in the function's output to a small change in a single input, with other inputs held constant, in the limit as the input change approaches zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

## Deriving the Heat Equation

The [[heat_equation_in_onedimensional_case | heat equation]] is written in terms of these partial derivatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. It states that the rate of change of temperature with respect to time is proportional to the second partial derivative with respect to space (x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### Intuition from a Discrete Model

To understand its origin, consider a discrete version with finitely many points `x` in a row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. The intuition is that if a point's two neighbors are, on average, hotter than it is, it will heat up; if cooler, it will cool down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. The rate of change for a point's temperature (`dT2/dt`) is proportional to the difference between its neighbors' average temperature and its own value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This can be re-written as proportional to the "difference of the differences," also known as a **second difference** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

### Transition to the Continuous Case

As this discrete model transitions to the infinite continuous case, the analog of a second difference is the **second derivative** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. The second partial derivative with respect to `x` (written as ∂²T/∂x²) measures how the rate of change of temperature itself changes along the rod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. A positive second derivative means the graph curves upwards, and a negative one means it curves downwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. The core intuition is that points where the temperature distribution curves tend to change more quickly in the direction of that curvature, i.e., flatten out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Thus, second derivatives provide a measure of how a value compares to the average of its neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

For objects in higher dimensions (e.g., a plate or 3D object), the [[heat_equation_in_onedimensional_case | heat equation]] includes second derivatives for all spatial directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. The sum of these second spatial derivatives is called the **Laplacian** (often written as ∇²) and is a multivariable version of the second derivative that still intuitively measures how different a point is from the average of its neighbors, considering all directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

## PDEs vs. ODEs: A Deeper Comparison

In [[differential_equations_and_their_applications | differential equations]] like gravitational interactions of multiple bodies, [[introduction_to_ordinary_and_partial_differential_equations | ODEs]] analyze a handful of changing numbers, where the rate of change of one value depends on other values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. In contrast, the [[heat_equation_in_onedimensional_case | heat equation]], a PDE, models infinitely many values changing from a continuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. Although each value depends on others, it helpfully only relies on its immediate neighbors in a limiting sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. This means the relation on the right-hand side is not a sum or product of other numbers but a derivative with respect to space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. The [[heat_equation_in_onedimensional_case | heat equation]] can be thought of as a system of infinitely many equations, one for each point on the rod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

## Solving the Heat Equation and Fourier Series

Unlike most [[solving_partial_differential_equations | PDEs]], the [[heat_equation_in_onedimensional_case | heat equation]] is actually solvable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. The method for [[solving_partial_differential_equations | solving]] this problem led Joseph Fourier to discover [[fourier_series_and_their_relation_to_the_heat_equation | Fourier series]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

[[fourier_series_and_their_relation_to_the_heat_equation | Fourier series]] demonstrate how arbitrary shapes or curves can be traced out by adding together many small rotating vectors, each rotating at a constant integer frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. By adjusting the initial size and angle of each vector, any curve can be approximated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The mathematical principles behind this process are the same ones that describe the physics of [[mathematical_modeling_of_heat_flow | heat flow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This connection between [[fourier_series_and_their_relation_to_the_heat_equation | Fourier series]] and the [[heat_equation_in_onedimensional_case | heat equation]] is a fundamental aspect of [[applications_of_fourier_series_in_heat_distribution | applications of Fourier series in heat distribution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

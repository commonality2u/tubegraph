The debate surrounding the fundamental circle constant often revolves around whether it should be pi (approximately 3.14) or tau (approximately 6.28) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Tau, representing the ratio of a circle's circumference to its radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, was popularized by Michael Hartl's tau manifesto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, with some advocating for Robert Palace's notation of a pi with three legs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Proponents argue that many formulas appear cleaner using tau, largely because the number of radians for a given fraction of a circle is simply that fraction of tau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

However, the history of how pi became the standard is linked to one of history's most influential mathematicians, Leonhard Euler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Euler's Evolving Notation

Research into Euler's original documents by Ben Hambrecht, a 3b1b Switzerland correspondent, reveals surprising insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Initially, Euler used "pi" to represent the circumference of a circle whose radius is 1, which is the 6.28 constant now known as tau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. It's speculated he used the Greek letter pi as an abbreviation for "perimeter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

Despite this early usage, it was Euler himself who solidified the modern understanding of pi as approximately 3.1415 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This occurred in an early calculus book from 1748 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. In Chapter 8, while describing the semi-circumference of a circle with radius 1 and expanding its value to 128 digits (with one error) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, the author states: "which for the sake of brevity I may write pi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This particular book and section were pivotal in spreading the notation across Europe and eventually worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Euler's Flexible Approach to Constants

Further examination of Euler's work shows an even more fluid use of the symbol pi. He sometimes used it to represent a quarter turn of a circle (what is now known as pi halves or tau fourths) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Euler's usage of pi was often more analogous to the modern use of the Greek letter theta, which represents an angle generally rather than a specific value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. He would let pi represent whatever circle constant was most suitable for the problem at hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. It is worth noting that he typically framed problems in terms of unit circles with a radius of one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, thus conceiving 3.1415 as the ratio of a circle's semi-circumference to its radius, rather than circumference to diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## A Lesson from Euler's Prolific Work

Euler was an incredibly prolific problem solver, producing over 500 books and papers during his lifetime, at a rate of 800 dense math pages per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Another 400 publications surfaced posthumously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. It is humorously said that formulas are named after the second person to prove them because Euler was always the first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

Euler's primary focus was on solving the immediate task, not on debating which circle constant was fundamentally "correct" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Different problems naturally lent themselves to thinking about different constants: a quarter circle, a full circle, or a half circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

This adaptability in notation highlights a broader lesson for mathematics: the focus should be on solving specific problems and puzzles, whether practical or for intellectual curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Questions of standards and conventions can then be addressed within a given context, recognizing that different contexts may lead to different "natural" answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Euler's incredible output suggests that flexibility with conventions is more correlated with transformative insights than rigid adherence to "objectively right" standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

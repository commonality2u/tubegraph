Theoretical simulations often employ idealized physics to explore fundamental principles and uncover unexpected mathematical relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. These simulations simplify real-world complexities, allowing for clearer observation of specific phenomena.

## Purpose
An example of such a simulation involves two sliding blocks and a wall, used to count collisions under specific conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The primary goal is not a pragmatic demonstration of real-world physics, but rather to reveal surprising mathematical patterns, such as the appearance of pi in the total number of collisions under certain mass ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Assumptions and Conditions
In these theoretical models, physicists make highly idealistic assumptions:
*   **No Friction** The simulation assumes a complete absence of friction on the surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **[[physics_of_elastic_collisions | Perfectly Elastic Collisions]]** All collisions, both between blocks and between a block and the wall, are assumed to be [[physics_of_elastic_collisions | perfectly elastic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This condition implies that no energy is lost during any collision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
    *   While [[physics_of_elastic_collisions | perfectly elastic]] collisions would typically produce no sound, a "clack" sound is added in the simulation to help count collisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Conservation Laws** The underlying mathematics of such simulations relies on fundamental principles like the [[state_space_and_conservation_laws_in_classical_physics | conservation of energy]], which can reveal hidden mathematical structures, such as a "hidden circle" leading to the emergence of pi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Limitations
These idealized conditions are "way over-idealized" and "quickly depart from anything that could possibly happen in real physics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. For instance, to compute many digits of pi using this method, the mass differences between blocks would become astronomically large, exceeding the mass of supermassive black holes, and the collision frequency would be impossibly high, requiring extreme numerical precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Therefore, the value of such simulations lies in their ability to demonstrate elegant mathematical connections rather than their practical applicability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

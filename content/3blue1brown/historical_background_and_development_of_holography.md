The [[basic_concept_of_holograms_and_its_magical_appearance | hologram]], a recording on film that creates the illusion of looking through a window into a recorded three-dimensional scene, has a fascinating history of development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## Initial Discovery and Theory

The fundamental principle behind holography was discovered by Dennis Gabor in 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. At the time, Gabor was engaged in research aimed at improving methods for electron microscopy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. As recounted, the pivotal insight came to him while he was watching a tennis match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

In its earliest stages, Gabor encountered significant challenges in viewing the [[basic_concept_of_holograms_and_its_magical_appearance | holograms]] he intended to create. This difficulty arose because a phenomenon known as the "conjugate image" often interfered, obscuring the desired reconstructed image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:57:00">[29:57:00]</a>. However, it was later discovered that by shining the reference beam at an angle, a clean separation of the reconstructed object wave from this conjugate wave artifact could be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:07:00">[30:07:00]</a>.

Gabor himself described his discovery not as a deliberate invention, but as "an exercise in serendipity, the art of looking for something and finding something else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:54:00">[37:54:00]</a>.

## Confirmation of Light's Wave Nature

Before Gabor's discovery, [[scientific_principles_behind_holography_including_light_waves_and_interference | the wave nature of light]] was a crucial concept. Thomas Young's double-slit experiment in 1801 provided one of the earliest confirmations that light behaves as a wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00">[18:24:00]</a>. This experiment showed that when monochromatic light passes through two thin slits, the resulting pattern on a screen includes oscillations of bright and dark spots, demonstrating the interference of light waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:00">[18:28:00]</a>.

## Practical Application and Recognition

Holography did not become practically feasible until decades after Gabor's initial discovery, with the invention of lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. Lasers provide the monochromatic, coherent light necessary for creating [[basic_concept_of_holograms_and_its_magical_appearance | holograms]].

In recognition of his groundbreaking work, Dennis Gabor was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1971 for his discovery of the holographic method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. The significance of holography extends beyond its use as an art form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:51:00">[36:51:00]</a>.

## Types of Holograms and Advancements

The simplest form of [[basic_concept_of_holograms_and_its_magical_appearance | holograms]], known as a [[detailed_explanation_of_transmission_and_reflection_holograms | transmission hologram]], became possible in the late 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. These [[basic_concept_of_holograms_and_its_magical_appearance | holograms]] are visible only when illuminated with a laser from behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

More advanced techniques have since emerged, such as [[detailed_explanation_of_transmission_and_reflection_holograms | white light reflection holograms]], which can be viewed using ordinary light reflecting off them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. Further developments include methods where changes in a scene over time become visible when viewing a [[basic_concept_of_holograms_and_its_magical_appearance | hologram]] from different angles, and the ability to produce [[basic_concept_of_holograms_and_its_magical_appearance | holograms]] from 3D computer graphics models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

For a deeper look into the history and physics of holography, Gabor's Nobel Prize lecture is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

### Key Contrast with Photography

A key distinction that underlines the development of holography is its difference from ordinary photography. In a photograph, each point on the film is influenced by only a narrow region of the recorded scene, akin to a pixel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. A simple pinhole camera, for instance, limits light to pass through a tiny hole, ensuring each part of the film "sees" only a single, narrow region of the scene through that hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. This process inherently loses information from all other possible viewing angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.

In contrast, the objective of a [[basic_concept_of_holograms_and_its_magical_appearance | hologram]] is to recreate the entire light field surrounding a scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. This requires recording not only the amplitude of light waves but also their phase, a piece of information lost in traditional photography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. The ability to record and reconstruct an entire wavefront is a valuable tool with various [[practical_applications_and_significance_of_holograms_in_various_fields | practical applications]], including interferometry, a technique used to measure extremely small distances using wave interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

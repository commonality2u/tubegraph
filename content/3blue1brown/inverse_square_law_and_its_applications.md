The inverse square law describes a phenomenon where the intensity of a quantity radiating from a point source is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from that source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31">[04:31]</a>. This law is a distinctly three-dimensional phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48">[03:48]</a>.

## How it Works (Light Example)

Imagine rays of light hitting a screen one unit away from a source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54">[03:54]</a>.
*   If you double the distance from the source, those same rays will now cover an area with twice the width and twice the height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59">[03:59]</a>.
*   It would take four copies of the original screen to receive the same amount of light at that doubled distance, meaning each individual screen receives one-fourth as much light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04">[04:04]</a>. This is why a light would appear one-fourth as bright two times the distance away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15">[04:15]</a>.
*   Similarly, when you are three times farther away, you would need nine copies of the original screen to receive the same rays, so each individual screen only receives one-ninth as much light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20">[04:20]</a>.

This pattern continues because the area hit by a light increases by the square of the distance, leading to the brightness of that light decreasing by the inverse square of that distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31">[04:31]</a>.

## Applications Beyond Light

The inverse square law is not special to light; it appears whenever a quantity spreads out evenly from a point source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47">[04:47]</a>. Examples include:
*   Sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52">[04:52]</a>
*   Heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52">[04:52]</a>
*   Radio signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52">[04:52]</a>

## Connection to the Basel Problem

The inverse square law is crucial in understanding the physical implementation of the Basel Problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57">[04:57]</a>. In this context, an infinite array of evenly spaced lighthouses demonstrates the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03">[05:03]</a>. The apparent brightness from the first lighthouse can be considered a brightness of one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56">[01:56]</a>. The apparent brightness of the second lighthouse is one-fourth as much as the first, the third is one-ninth, and so on, following the inverse square law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01">[02:01]</a>.

The total brightness received from an infinite line of lighthouses is represented by the sum: 1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + 1/16 + ... <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17">[02:17]</a>. The objective is to show that this total brightness equals pi squared divided by 6 times the brightness of the first lighthouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28">[02:28]</a>. This problem is also related to the [[inverse_pythagorean_theorem | Inverse Pythagorean theorem]], which states that the sum of the inverse squares of two distances (1/a² + 1/b²) equals the inverse square of a third distance (1/h²) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27">[06:27]</a>.

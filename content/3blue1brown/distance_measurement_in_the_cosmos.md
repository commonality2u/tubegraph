An animation was created by Paul D'Step to illustrate how distances to various objects in the cosmos are known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This animation zooms out by a factor of 10 every three seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Representing Cosmic Scale

The animation effectively demonstrates the vastness of space, showing many seemingly "blank orders of magnitude" after departing the solar system before the first star appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

However, these kinds of [[powers_of_10_scale_in_astronomy | powers of 10]] zoom-outs can risk underselling the true scale of the Universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The implied camera position moves much faster than the cosmic speed limit (the speed of light) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This can make distant objects, such as other [[galaxies_and_the_sloan_digital_sky_survey | galaxies]], feel more accessible than they are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. For instance, traveling at the speed of light would still take approximately 2.5 million years to reach the nearest [[galaxies_and_the_sloan_digital_sky_survey | galaxy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Mapping Distances to Galaxies

When creating the animation, the creators faced challenges in ending the zoom-out while remaining scientifically accurate and avoiding artistic renditions of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The solution adopted was to use a simple point cloud representing data from the [[galaxies_and_the_sloan_digital_sky_survey | Sloan Galactic Survey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This survey essentially maps the distances to various [[galaxies_and_the_sloan_digital_sky_survey | galaxies]] across many different directions in the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

The ability to map and study patterns like clusters and strands formed by billions of [[galaxies_and_the_sloan_digital_sky_survey | galaxies]], despite them being millions and billions of light-years away and beyond our grasp, is a mind-boggling testament to the powers of [[scientific_mapping_of_the_universe | science]] and deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

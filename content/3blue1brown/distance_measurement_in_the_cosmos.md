An animation by Paul D'Steppe illustrates the vastness of space by zooming out by a factor of 10 every three seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This visualization was created as part of a series explaining how we determine the distances to various cosmic objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. One notable aspect of the animation is how, upon departing the solar system, it traverses numerous seemingly blank orders of magnitude before the first star becomes visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Challenges in Visualizing Cosmic Distances

While effective, such "powers of 10" zoom-outs can inadvertently undersell the true [[scale of the universe | Scale of the Universe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The implied camera position moves vastly faster than the cosmic speed limit, the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This can make distant objects, such as other galaxies, appear deceptively accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. In reality, traveling at the speed of light would still take approximately 2.5 million years to reach the nearest galaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Mapping the Distant Cosmos

Creating an accurate scientific ending for the zoom-out animation proved challenging, as the goal was to avoid artist renditions of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The solution adopted was a simple point cloud visualization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This point cloud represents data sourced from the [[Slone galactic survey and galaxy mapping | Slone galactic survey]], which maps the distances to various galaxies across many different directions in the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

The ability to map these galaxies, which are millions and billions of light-years away and beyond our direct grasp, stands as a profound testament to the power of science and deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Despite the immense distances, this mapping allows for the study of patterns like the clusters and strands formed by billions of galaxies within the unfathomable reaches of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

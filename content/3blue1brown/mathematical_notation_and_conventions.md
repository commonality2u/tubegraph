Mathematical notation and conventions, while often appearing rigid, have evolved significantly over time, reflecting practical considerations and problem-solving approaches rather than fixed, "correct" definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. The history of the circle constant `pi` serves as a notable example of this evolution.

## The Pi vs. Tau Debate

The ongoing discussion concerning `pi` (approximately 3.14) versus `tau` (approximately 6.28) highlights a modern debate about the fundamental circle constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.
*   **Pi (π)**: Traditionally defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, familiar as 3.14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   **Tau (τ)**: Proposed as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its radius, approximately 6.28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This constant was popularized by Michael Hartle's "tau manifesto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

Proponents of `tau` argue that many formulas appear cleaner using `tau`, primarily because the number of radians describing a fraction of a circle is directly that fraction of `tau` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Leonhard Euler's Influence on Pi's Standardization

The standardization of `pi` as 3.14 owes much to the influential mathematician [[Eulers formula and mathematical proofs | Leonhard Euler]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.

### Euler's Flexible Use of Notation

Euler's early notes show him using `pi` to represent the circumference of a circle with radius 1 (which is 6.28), a value we would now call `tau` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. It is likely he used the Greek letter `pi` as an abbreviation for "perimeter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

However, the widespread adoption of `pi` as 3.14 was cemented by an early calculus book published by Euler in 1748 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. In Chapter 8 of this book, when describing the semi-circumference of a circle with radius 1 (after expanding it to 128 digits), Euler states, "which for the sake of brevity I may write pi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. This publication was instrumental in spreading the notation across Europe and eventually worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

Euler's use of the symbol `pi` was not consistently fixed. He also used it to represent a quarter turn of a circle (what is now `pi` halves or `tau` fourths) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. His approach was more akin to how the Greek letter `theta` is used today: as a variable to represent an angle, rather than a specific constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. Euler would let `pi` represent the circle constant that best suited the problem he was addressing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. He typically framed problems in terms of unit circles with radius one, so the 3.1415 constant was usually conceived as the ratio of a circle's semi-circumference to its radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

### Euler's Problem-Solving Philosophy

Euler was a prolific mathematician who consistently solved problems, producing over 500 books and papers during his lifetime, at a rate of 800 dense math pages per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. His focus was on the task at hand, not on defining which circle constant should be considered fundamental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. For different problems, the quarter circle constant, the full circle constant, or the half-circle constant might have been the most natural to consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

This approach offers a general lesson about how mathematics should be approached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

## Broader Implications for Mathematical Practice

The varying use of `pi` by Euler illustrates that the "correctness" of mathematical notation or conceptualization often depends on the context of the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

Often in math education, there is an overemphasis on which of multiple competing views on a topic is "right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. Questions such as:
*   Is the sum of all positive integers negative 1/12, or does it diverge to infinity? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>
*   Can infinitesimal values in calculus be taken literally, or should terms only be expressed in limits? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>
*   Is it permissible to divide a number by zero? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>

Such questions, in isolation, may not be productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. Instead, the focus should be on solving specific problems and puzzles, whether practical or for the sake of knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. When questions of standards or conventions arise, they should be answered with respect to a given context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. Different contexts naturally lead to different answers about what seems most appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

[[Mathematical Insights and Elegant Solutions | Producing profound mathematical insights]] seems to correlate more with a flexibility towards conventions than with rigid adherence to what standards are considered "objectively right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

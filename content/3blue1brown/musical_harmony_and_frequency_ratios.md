The concept of musical harmony can be explored by analyzing the frequency ratios between two notes. A challenge involves determining whether a given frequency ratio, R, will result in a pleasant or unpleasant sound without listening to the notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.

## The Pythagorean View: Rational vs. Irrational Ratios

An initial approach to understanding musical harmony, attributed to Pythagoras, suggests that two notes sound good together when their frequency ratio is a [[rational_versus_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational number]], and bad when it is an [[rational_versus_irrational_numbers_in_music | irrational number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>.

For instance, specific [[rational_versus_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational ratios]] correspond to traditional musical intervals:
*   A ratio of 3/2 produces a musical fifth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:06">[01:26:06]</a>.
*   A ratio of 4/3 yields a musical fourth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:02">[01:31:02]</a>.
*   A ratio of 8/5 results in a major sixth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:01">[01:35:01]</a>.

This phenomenon is hypothesized to occur because when the ratio of frequencies is [[rational_versus_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational]], a detectable pattern emerges in the beats of the notes. When slowed down, this pattern is perceived as a rhythm, and the brain picking up on this pattern makes the notes sound pleasant together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

## Complexity of Rational Ratios

Despite the Pythagorean view, not all [[rational_versus_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational numbers]] create harmonious sounds. For example, ratios like 211/198 or 1093/826 typically sound cacophonous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>. The issue is that these [[rational_versus_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational numbers]] are "more complicated" than others, and our ears may not pick up on the underlying pattern of the beats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

A simple measure of the complexity of a [[rational_versus_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational number]] is the size of its denominator when written in reduced form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. Therefore, a refinement suggests that only fractions with low denominators (e.g., less than 10) tend to be harmonious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.

## The Role of Irrational Ratios and Approximations

However, this still doesn't fully capture [[harmonious_versus_cacophonous_sounds_in_music | harmoniousness]], as many notes sound good together even when their frequency ratio is [[rational_versus_irrational_numbers_in_music | irrational]], provided it is close to a harmonious [[rational_versus_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

Many instruments, such as pianos, are not tuned using [[rational_versus_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational intervals]]. Instead, each half-step increase in frequency corresponds to multiplying the original frequency by the 12th root of 2, which is an [[rational_versus_irrational_numbers_in_music | irrational number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. This means that a harmonious interval, like a musical fifth, when played on a piano, will not have a perfect [[rational_versus_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational ratio]] (e.g., 3/2). Instead, it will be a power of the 12th root of 2 (e.g., 2^(7/12)), an [[rational_versus_irrational_numbers_in_music | irrational number]] very close to the expected [[rational_versus_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational ratio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. Similarly, a musical fourth corresponds to 2^(5/12), which is very close to 4/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

The effectiveness of the 12-note chromatic scale is due to the "strange tendency" of powers of the 12th root of 2 to be within a 1% margin of error of simple [[rational_versus_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

## Refined Definition of Harmony

A ratio R will produce a [[harmonious_versus_cacophonous_sounds_in_music | harmonious]] pair of notes if it is sufficiently close to a [[rational_versus_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational number]] with a sufficiently small denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. The degree of "closeness" depends on the listener's discerning ear, and the definition of a "small denominator" depends on the intricacy of harmonic patterns the ear is trained to perceive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>. Someone with an acute musical sense might find pleasure in patterns resulting from more complicated fractions like 23/21 or 35/43, as well as numbers closely approximating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.

## The Musical Savant and Measure Theory Connection

This leads to a thought experiment: if a musical savant finds pleasure in all pairs of notes with a [[rational_versus_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational ratio]], even the most complicated ones, would they find all ratios R between 1 and 2 [[harmonious_versus_cacophonous_sounds_in_music | harmonious]], including the [[rational_versus_irrational_numbers_in_music | irrational]] ones? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a> This question connects to a foundational result in measure theory concerning the covering of rational numbers with open intervals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.

It is possible to cover all [[rational_versus_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational numbers]] between 0 and 1 with an infinite number of open intervals such that the sum of their lengths is strictly less than 1 (and can be arbitrarily small) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. This concept, though counterintuitive, suggests that even though [[rational_versus_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational numbers]] are dense within the real numbers, there's a way to "skip" over most of the real numbers while still hitting every [[rational_versus_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.

By analogy, this mathematical result sheds light on the nature of musical harmony. The "fat" intervals covering [[rational_versus_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational numbers]] with small denominators correspond to [[harmonious_versus_cacophonous_sounds_in_music | harmonious]] sounds, while the extremely small intervals covering [[rational_versus_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational numbers]] with large denominators, or [[rational_versus_irrational_numbers_in_music | irrational numbers]] very close to them, correspond to [[harmonious_versus_cacophonous_sounds_in_music | cacophonous]] sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>. The fact that a large percentage of numbers remain uncovered, even if all [[rational_versus_irrational_numbers_in_music | rational numbers]] are considered "harmonious" by a savant, suggests that harmonious numbers are still rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>. This connection highlights the profound link between abstract mathematical concepts and the subjective experience of musical harmony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>.

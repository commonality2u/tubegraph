Einstein described the methods used to deduce the shape of Earth's orbit as an "idea of pure genius" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This perspective highlights the ingenuity involved in humanity's first attempts to determine the sizes of objects, from the Earth to the solar system and beyond to the universe itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Each measurement in this "distance ladder" unlocks a path to the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The journey of measuring [[distance_measurement_in_the_cosmos | cosmic distances]] is less about presenting facts and more about understanding the clever reasoning and mathematical "tricks" used to acquire that knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## The Earth's Shape and Size

The very first step on this ladder is determining the radius of the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### Deducting Earth's Spherical Shape

To even ask about Earth's radius, one must presume it's spherical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The first truly convincing proof of Earth's spherical shape came from observations of the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This utilizes the concept that to measure one object (Earth), a reference object some distance away (the Moon) is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

Aristotle could deduce Earth's shape by observing lunar eclipses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Lunar eclipses occur when the Moon passes into the Earth's shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The Earth's shadow, as seen on the Moon during an eclipse, consistently forms a circular arc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This visible circular shadow is proof that the Earth is round, requiring no advanced technology like telescopes or sextants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### [[eratosthenes_and_the_measurement_of_earths_circumference | Eratosthenes' Measurement of Earth's Circumference]]

The first known person to measure the size of the Earth was [[eratosthenes_and_the_measurement_of_earths_circumference | Eratosthenes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. His method involved a comparison between two locations: Syene and Alexandria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

On the summer solstice in Syene, the Sun's reflection could be seen in a well at noon, indicating the Sun was directly overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. However, in Alexandria, [[eratosthenes_and_the_measurement_of_earths_circumference | Eratosthenes]] observed no such reflection in his well at noon on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Knowing the Earth was round, he understood that the Sun's rays, being effectively parallel due to its great distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, were not vertical in Alexandria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

On the summer solstice, the Earth's axis is tilted towards the Sun, meaning locations along the Tropic of Cancer (where Syene sits) experience the Sun directly overhead at high noon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. [[eratosthenes_and_the_measurement_of_earths_circumference | Eratosthenes]], in Alexandria (further north), used a gnomon (an ancient protractor/sundial) to measure that the Sun was approximately 7 degrees off the vertical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

He deduced that this 7-degree angle represented the arc length along the Earth between Alexandria and Syene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Therefore, the ratio of 7 degrees to the full 360 degrees of a circle must be the same as the ratio of the distance between the two towns to the Earth's full circumference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

The distance between the towns was approximated as 5,000 stadia, roughly 500 miles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, possibly estimated by merchants or by counting steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Using this, [[eratosthenes_and_the_measurement_of_earths_circumference | Eratosthenes]]' estimate for Earth's circumference was about 10% accurate, an impressive feat with no technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. In principle, this single direct measurement could be the foundation for measuring the diameter of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## Distance to the Moon

Once the Earth's size is known, the next cosmological distance to deduce is that between the Earth and the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Again, eclipses are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

During a lunar eclipse, the Moon traverses the Earth's shadow. The Earth's shadow is approximately twice the radius of the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Ancient astronomers knew that lunar eclipses last no longer than four hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, and the Moon takes one lunar month (about 28 days) to complete its orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. By comparing the duration of the eclipse to the full orbital period, and including the Moon's own radius, Aristarchus estimated the distance to the Moon as about 60 Earth radii <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This estimate was remarkably accurate, considering the Moon's orbit varies between 58 and 62 Earth radii <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

## Size of the Moon

The relative size of the Moon and Earth can be observed during lunar eclipses; the Moon is about a quarter as wide as the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. The Greeks, without photography, had another method to deduce the Moon's size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

By observing how long it takes for a full Moon to rise (around two minutes), they accounted for the Earth's rotation scanning the line of sight over the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Since the Moon effectively cycles around the Earth every 24 hours (due to Earth's rotation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, they could determine the ratio between the Moon's radius and its distance by comparing two minutes to 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Knowing the distance to the Moon, they could then figure out its radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. These estimates, though approximate due to the Moon's elliptical orbit, were quite good with minimal technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

Moon phases also prove the Moon is round; if it were flat, we would see either a dim or lit Moon, not varying phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

## Distance to the Sun

Measuring the Sun's distance was much trickier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. The method does not depend on whether the Sun orbits the Earth or vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. A key coincidence is that during a solar eclipse, the Moon and Sun appear to be almost exactly the same size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. This means the ratio of the Moon's radius to its distance from Earth is nearly the same as the ratio of the Sun's radius to its distance from Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

To find the actual distance to the Sun, observers used the phases of the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. A half Moon occurs when the Earth and Sun make a right angle at the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. The further away the Sun is, the closer the half Moon appears to be exactly halfway between a new Moon and a full Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. By measuring the angle separating the half Moon from the true halfway point, trigonometry allows for the calculation of the Sun's distance: the distance to the Moon divided by the sine of that angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

Aristarchus attempted this, estimating a half Moon occurred 6 hours before the midpoint between new and full Moons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. This was incorrect; the actual discrepancy is only half an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. Ancient Greek technology, lacking accurate clocks and telescopes, was insufficient for the precision required for this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. Aristarchus's estimate placed the Sun only 20 times further away than the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>, when the true distance is more like 370 times the Moon's distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. Consequently, he believed the Sun was 7 times bigger than Earth, instead of the actual 109 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.

Despite the flawed measurement, Aristarchus made a profoundly important conclusion: the Sun did not orbit the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. He reasoned that if the Sun was significantly larger than Earth (even at his underestimated 7x), it would be more logical for the Earth to orbit the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. Thus, he was the first to propose the heliocentric model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>, a fact noted by Copernicus centuries later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

The other Greeks dismissed Aristarchus's heliocentric model due to a lack of observable parallax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. If the Earth moved around the Sun, the apparent positions of constellations (nearby stars relative to background stars) should shift throughout the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. Since no such shift was observed, they concluded the stars must be much, much farther away than imagined if the heliocentric model was true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. This limitation, due to technology and the immense scale of the universe (billions and trillions of times larger than they could comprehend) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>, meant the heliocentric truth remained unaccepted for centuries.

## [[Keplers_contributions_to_astronomy | Kepler's Contributions]]: Deducing Orbital Shapes

A significant leap in [[historical_orbital_data_analysis | historical orbital data analysis]] came with [[Keplers_contributions_to_astronomy | Kepler]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>, building on Copernicus's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. Copernicus had already established that planets orbit the Sun and had calculated their orbital periods, such as Earth's one year and Mars's 687 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. These periods, derived from centuries of Babylonian observations of planetary patterns among stars, were crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.

[[Keplers_contributions_to_astronomy | Kepler]] initially sought to prove a pet theory linking the ratios of planetary orbits to the five Platonic solids, believing it represented a "natural or universal set of ratios" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. To test this theory, he needed precise historical data on planetary positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. He acquired, by less-than-amicable means, the extensive observational records of Tycho Brahe, a wealthy Danish astronomer who had compiled decades of planetary observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.

However, [[Keplers_contributions_to_astronomy | Kepler]] found that his Platonic solid theory was off by a couple of percent, and even Copernicus's model of circular orbits could not perfectly fit Brahe's precise data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>. This meant throwing out the assumption of circular orbits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.

The challenge was immense: Tycho Brahe's data only provided the apparent direction of planets in the sky (their position relative to constellations), not their absolute distances in 3D space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. From this information—a sequence of angles—[[Keplers_contributions_to_astronomy | Kepler]] deduced the shapes of all planetary orbits, including Earth's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>.

### The Genius of Kepler's Method

Recognizing that Mars returns to the same point in its orbit every 687 days (its orbital period, which Copernicus had calculated) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>, [[Keplers_contributions_to_astronomy | Kepler]] used this as a fixed reference point in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. By analyzing Tycho Brahe's data at intervals of 687 days over 10 years, [[Keplers_contributions_to_astronomy | Kepler]] could pinpoint Earth's position relative to the Sun and that "fixed" point of Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.

On any given night, an observer on Earth knows their direction to the Sun (based on the date) and their direction to Mars (from observations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. If Mars were stationary, these two directions would be enough to triangulate Earth's position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>. Since Mars *does* move, [[Keplers_contributions_to_astronomy | Kepler]] used the fact that it returns to the same orbital position at predictable intervals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. By collecting observations separated by Mars's orbital period, he created multiple data points for Earth's position *relative to the same point in Mars's orbit* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>.

This allowed [[Keplers_contributions_to_astronomy | Kepler]] to piece together a coherent orbit for Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. He discovered that Earth's orbit is an ellipse, not a circle, and also found that the area swept out by Earth as it orbits is constant over equal time periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. Once Earth's orbital shape was known, deducing Mars's orbit (or any other planet's) became much easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>. By taking measurements from Earth at five separate nights spaced by 687 days (when Mars is at the same point in space), the multiple angles allowed him to triangulate Mars's position relative to Earth's known orbit, thus drawing out its exact elliptical orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>.

Einstein famously praised this idea as "pure genius" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>. [[Keplers_contributions_to_astronomy | Kepler]] synthesized centuries of data, including that from the Babylonians and Copernicus, with his own data analysis to achieve this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

However, this method only provided the *shapes* of the orbits relative to each other; the absolute scale of the solar system remained unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>. Astronomers then focused on finding a precise way to measure just one absolute distance within the solar system, knowing that this single measurement would "lock everything else into place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>. This would eventually lead to calculating the [[historical_estimations_of_light_speed | speed of light]], distances to stars, and ultimately the most distant observable galaxies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>.

Mathematics can be compelling due to the beauty of [[geometric_reasoning_in_higher_dimensions | geometric reasoning]] in two and three dimensions, offering a clear connection between pairs or triplets of numbers and spatial concepts that our visual cortex can easily process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This relationship makes opaque analytical facts clear through geometry, and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. For instance, a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin conceptualizes all pairs of numbers (x, y) where x² + y² = 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This specific connection between sums of squares and circles or spheres is fundamental to understanding concepts like pi's relation to number theory, visualizing Pythagorean triples, and applying topological facts about spheres to solve counting puzzles (e.g., Borsuk-Ulam theorem) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## The Challenge of Higher Dimensions

However, this intuitive connection breaks down when dealing with quadruplets, quintuplets, or hundreds of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Our physical space constrains our geometric intuition, making it frustrating to conceptualize lists of many numbers as individual points in some space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. For mathematicians, computer scientists, and physicists, problems involving lists of more than three numbers are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The standard approach to [[geometric_reasoning_in_higher_dimensions | doing math in higher dimensions]] often relies on analogies from two and three dimensions, but primarily uses analytical reasoning, much like a pilot relying on instruments through clouds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## A Hybrid Approach: Sliders and "Real Estate"

To bridge this gap, a hybrid approach combines geometric and analytical views, making analytical reasoning more visual in a way that generalizes to arbitrarily high dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The focus is on [[understanding_higher_dimensional_spheres_and_shapes | higher dimensional spheres]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. A four-dimensional sphere with radius one centered at the origin is the set of all quadruplets (x, y, z, w) where x² + y² + z² + w² = 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

Instead of confusing projections, the idea is to think literally about four separate numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This can be visualized using vertical number lines with sliders, where each slider represents a coordinate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Each configuration of these sliders represents a point in N-dimensional space (e.g., a quadruplet in 4D) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Being on a unit sphere means the sum of the squares of these values is one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Understanding Spheres with Sliders

To understand movements on a sphere, it helps to simplify to two dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. The relation x² + y² = 1 can be thought of in terms of "real estate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>:
*   x² is the "real estate" belonging to x, and y² is the "real estate" belonging to y <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   They share a total of one unit of real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   Moving around on the circle corresponds to a constant exchange of this real estate between the variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   "Real estate" is "cheap" near zero and "expensive" away from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. For example, moving x from 1 to 0.9 (losing 0.19 real estate) requires y to move 0.44 units from 0 to gain the same 0.19 real estate, illustrating the "steep slope" near the axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This "piston dance" motion shows sliders moving slower away from zero due to more expensive real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

For a unit sphere in three dimensions (x² + y² + z² = 1), a third slider for z is added, still sharing one unit of real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Holding one variable constant (e.g., x = 0.5, occupying 0.25 real estate) leaves the remaining variables (y and z) to trade off the rest (0.75 real estate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. This corresponds to slicing the sphere, where the circular slice becomes smaller as the fixed variable's real estate increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. When x reaches 1, no real estate is left for y and z, forcing them to 0 (a singularity point) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

In four dimensions and higher, the global spatial view is lost, but the rules of real estate exchange remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Fixing one slider in a 4D sphere yields a 3D sphere as the remaining three trade off real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

## The Corner Sphere Problem

This visualization method is useful for a classic problem: finding the radius of an inner sphere tangent to spheres centered at the corners of a hypercube.

### 2D Case: A 2x2 Box

Consider a 2x2 box centered at the origin, with corners at (±1, ±1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Four circles, each with radius 1, are centered at these corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. The goal is to find the radius of a circle centered at the origin that is just large enough to touch these corner circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, the distance from the origin to a corner (e.g., 1,1) is √2 ≈ 1.414 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Subtracting the radius of a corner circle (which is 1) gives an inner circle radius of √2 - 1 ≈ 0.414 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. This seems reasonable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### 3D Case: A 2x2x2 Cube

In three dimensions, a 2x2x2 cube has 8 corners (±1, ±1, ±1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Eight spheres, each with radius 1, are centered at these vertices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. The distance from the origin to a corner (e.g., 1,1,1) is √(1² + 1² + 1²) = √3 ≈ 1.73 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. The radius of the inner sphere is √3 - 1 ≈ 0.73 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. This also seems reasonable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

### Analyzing with Sliders

To understand this in higher dimensions, it helps to analyze the 2D and 3D cases using sliders. For a circle centered at a corner like (1, -1), the real estate for x is the square of its distance from 1, and for y, it's the square of its distance from -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. The "piston dance" trade-off remains the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

The point of tangency between the inner circle and a corner circle occurs when the coordinates are the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. At this point, the real estate is shared evenly between x and y (relative to the corner) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Any slight perturbation away from this point increases the distance from the origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. This tangent point is also a point on the inner circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>, allowing us to determine its radius by measuring the total real estate with respect to the origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. In 2D, both x and y dip below 0.5 at this point, so x² + y² < 0.5² + 0.5² = 0.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

In three dimensions, for a corner sphere centered at (1,1,1), the closest point to the origin is where x, y, and z are all equal and moving towards 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. They must go beyond 0.5 because 0.5 accounts for only 0.25 real estate (0.5²), and with three coordinates, they need to sum to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. This tangent point on the inner sphere has x, y, and z values less than 0.5, so the total real estate (x² + y² + z²) is less than 0.75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. The inner sphere is smaller than the corner spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

### 4D: A Surprising Result

In four dimensions, a 2x2x2x2 hypercube has 16 vertices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. There are 16 unit spheres centered at these corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. For the corner sphere centered at (1,1,1,1), the point closest to the origin is where all four coordinates are exactly halfway between 1 and 0 (i.e., 0.5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. This is because when a coordinate is 0.5 units away from 1, it has 0.25 units of real estate with respect to point 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

When viewing this as a point on the inner sphere and measuring real estate with respect to the origin (0,0,0,0), each of these four coordinates still has 0.25 units of real estate (0.5² = 0.25) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. This makes for a total of 1 shared unit of real estate among the four coordinates (4 * 0.25 = 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

This means that the inner sphere is *precisely the same size* as the corner spheres, having a radius of 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. Numerically, the distance from the origin to a corner (1,1,1,1) is √4 = 2, and subtracting the corner sphere radius of 1 gives an inner radius of 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. This [[threedimensional_puzzles_and_fourdimensional_insights | four-dimensional insight]] is counterintuitive from 2D/3D perspectives; the inner sphere touches the 2x2x2x2 box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.

### 5D and 10D: Beyond Intuition

The phenomenon becomes even stranger in higher dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.
*   **5 Dimensions:** For a 5D hypercube, there are 32 corner spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. The point closest to the origin on a corner sphere (e.g., centered at 1,1,1,1,1) is where all five coordinates equally split the real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. This means each coordinate is slightly *higher* than 0.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. From the origin's perspective, this configuration has *more* than one unit of real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. The inner sphere's radius is about 1.24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. This means the 5D inner sphere actually pokes *outside the box* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>.
*   **10 Dimensions:** In ten dimensions, points have ten coordinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. For a unit sphere, one unit of real estate is shared among these ten coordinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>. The point on a corner sphere (e.g., at 1,1,...,1) closest to the origin is where all ten coordinates split the real estate evenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>. This point is very far from the origin, meaning the inner sphere is allowed a very large amount of real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. The inner sphere's radius is about 2.16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>, meaning it's more than twice as big as the corner spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. This inner sphere is large enough to poke *outside a 4x4x4x... bounding box* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. The face of the box is always 2 units from the origin, regardless of dimension, as it only involves movement along a single axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. However, the corner point (1,1,...,1) becomes extremely far from the center as dimensions increase, as all ten dimensions add a full unit of real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. As dimensions increase, the inner sphere grows without bound, and the proportion of the inner sphere lying inside the box decreases exponentially towards zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.

## Conclusion

The "slider method" offers a more concrete way to think about [[understanding_higher_dimensional_spheres_and_shapes | high-dimensional shapes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>. While it represents each coordinate literally and is coordinate-dependent, it provides a crucial foothold for conceptualizing high-dimensional points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>. Thinking of squares of coordinates as "real estate" illuminates seemingly strange aspects of [[geometric_reasoning_in_higher_dimensions | high dimensions]], such as the increasing distance of a box's corner from its center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. This visual approach acts as a "redesign" of analytical instruments, leveraging the brain's image processing capabilities to think visually about what cannot be directly visualized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.

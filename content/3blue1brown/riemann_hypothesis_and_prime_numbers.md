The modern understanding of [[prime_numbers_and_their_regularities|prime numbers]], including questions about their [[distribution_of_prime_numbers|distribution]] and [[density_of_prime_numbers_and_natural_log|density]] in certain regions, often involves the use of complex numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This approach utilizes specially designed functions whose inputs and outputs are complex numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## The Riemann Hypothesis

This method forms the core of the famous [[the_riemann_hypothesis_and_trivial_zeros|Riemann hypothesis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. At its heart, the [[the_riemann_hypothesis_and_trivial_zeros|Riemann hypothesis]] concerns a specially designed function that appears unrelated to the discrete world of [[prime_numbers_and_their_regularities|primes]] because it is smooth and complex-valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. However, this function implicitly encodes all desired information about discrete [[prime_numbers_and_their_regularities|prime numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Certain questions about [[prime_numbers_and_their_regularities|primes]] can be more easily answered by analyzing this function rather than by directly analyzing the [[prime_numbers_and_their_regularities|primes]] themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

The techniques used to solve discrete math problems, such as counting subsets with a sum divisible by a certain number, are similar in spirit to the setup that leads to the [[the_riemann_hypothesis_and_trivial_zeros|Riemann hypothesis]] and the [[prime_numbers_and_their_regularities|Prime Number Theorem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Connection to Generating Functions and Dirichlet Series

In the study of [[prime_numbers_and_their_regularities|primes]] as conducted by Riemann, a discrete sequence containing information about [[prime_numbers_and_their_regularities|prime numbers]] is understood by considering a function whose coefficients are the terms in that sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>. This function is not a simple polynomial, but a related structure known as a [[dirichlets_theorem_in_number_theory|Dirichlet series]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>. Information about these coefficients is then extracted by studying how this function behaves with complex-valued inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. This extension of the domain beyond real numbers provides mathematicians with greater power in making deductions about the coefficients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>.

### Unreasonable Effectiveness of Complex Numbers

The utility of complex numbers in addressing discrete math problems, particularly those involving "frequency questions" like the sum of every fifth coefficient, stems from their ability to represent cycling behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. Complex numbers on the unit circle, specifically [[archimedean_spiral_formation_from_prime_numbers|roots of unity]], allow for successive products to exhibit this desired cycling behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a>. This concept, using roots of unity to detect frequency information, is exceptionally fruitful and forms the core idea behind Fourier transforms and Fourier series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a>.

The concept of a fundamental circle constant is subject to debate, primarily between pi (π) and tau (τ) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Pi vs. Tau

The traditional constant, pi (π), is defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, approximately 3.14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. However, a significant number of people argue that the fundamental constant should be tau (τ), the ratio of a circle's circumference to its radius, which is approximately 6.28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

The use of tau was popularized by Michael Hartle's "tau manifesto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, though Robert Palace also proposed a notation for it as a pi with three legs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Proponents of tau suggest that many formulas appear cleaner using tau, largely because the number of radians describing a given fraction of a circle is simply that fraction of tau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Historical Standardization

To understand how pi (3.14) became the standard, one can examine the notes and letters of [[leonhard_eulers_role_in_mathematical_constants | Leonhard Euler]], one of history's most influential mathematicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Through efforts by 3b1b Switzerland correspondent Ben Hambrecht, original documents from Euler's hometown library were accessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Surprisingly, in some of his earlier work, [[leonhard_eulers_role_in_mathematical_constants | Euler]] defined "pi" as the circumference of a circle whose radius is 1, which corresponds to the 6.28 constant now called tau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. It is thought that he used the Greek letter pi as an abbreviation for "perimeter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

The widespread adoption of pi (3.1415) as the commonly recognized circle constant can be largely attributed to an early calculus book from 1748 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. In Chapter 8, when describing the semi-circumference of a circle with radius 1 (which he expanded to 128 digits, with one error), the author stated, "which for the sake of brevity I may write pi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This specific book and section played a crucial role in spreading the notation throughout Europe and eventually worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. The author of this influential book was, in fact, [[leonhard_eulers_role_in_mathematical_constants | Leonhard Euler]] himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Euler's Flexible Approach

Further examination of [[leonhard_eulers_role_in_mathematical_constants | Euler]]'s work reveals instances where he used the symbol pi to represent other values, such as a quarter turn of a circle (what is now called pi halves or tau fourths) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. [[leonhard_eulers_role_in_mathematical_constants | Euler]]'s use of the letter pi appears more analogous to the modern use of the Greek letter theta (θ), which represents an angle but no specific angle in particular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

[[leonhard_eulers_role_in_mathematical_constants | Euler]] would let pi represent whatever circle constant best suited the problem he was addressing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. He typically framed problems in terms of unit circles with a radius of one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, meaning the 3.1415 constant would have been naturally thought of as the ratio of a circle's semi-circumference to its radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Lesson from Euler's Work Ethic

[[leonhard_eulers_role_in_mathematical_constants | Euler]] was a prolific problem-solver, generating an immense volume of mathematical work throughout his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. He wrote over 500 books and papers during his lifetime, averaging 800 dense math pages per year, with another 400 publications surfacing after his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. His focus was on solving the task at hand, not on debating which circle constant should be considered fundamental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Different problems naturally lent themselves to thinking about quarter-circle, full-circle, or half-circle constants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

This flexibility towards conventions is seen as correlated with his immense output and transformative insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. It suggests that in mathematics education, the emphasis should be on solving specific problems and puzzles, both practical and theoretical, rather than on determining which of multiple competing views on a topic is "correct" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Standards and conventions can then be chosen with respect to a given context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

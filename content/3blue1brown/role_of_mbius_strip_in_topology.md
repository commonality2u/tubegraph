The [[understanding_mbius_strips_and_klein_bottles | Möbius strip]] is a fascinating object in [[introduction_to_topology | topology]], frequently used to introduce the concept of a one-sided surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Beyond its visual novelty, the Möbius strip plays a crucial role in solving concrete mathematical problems, illustrating the practical significance of [[topology and its significance | topology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## The Inscribed Rectangle Problem

The role of the Möbius strip is best understood through its application to the "inscribed rectangle problem," a weaker version of the unsolved "inscribed square problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The inscribed square problem asks if any closed loop in space will always contain four points that form a square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. While this remains unsolved, the inscribed rectangle problem, which seeks to prove that any closed loop always contains four points forming a rectangle, has an elegant solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

The core idea for finding an inscribed rectangle is to identify two distinct pairs of points on the loop (e.g., A, C and B, D) that share a common midpoint and are equidistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. If these conditions are met, the four points A, B, C, D necessarily form a rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## Representing Pairs of Points

To tackle this, a specific function is defined that takes pairs of points from the loop and maps them to a point in 3D space. For any given pair of points, their midpoint `m` is located on the xy-plane (where the loop resides), and their distance `d` defines the z-coordinate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Plotting these points for all possible pairs generates a surface in 3D space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

The critical step is to find a natural way to represent all possible pairs of points on the loop.

### Ordered Pairs and the Torus

First, consider ordered pairs of points (where (A, B) is distinct from (B, A)) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. By conceptually cutting the closed loop and straightening it into a line segment (e.g., from 0 to 1), pairs of points on the loop can be mapped to points within a 1x1 unit square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. To account for the fact that the loop's endpoints are the same point, the edges of this square must be "glued": the left edge to the right edge, and the bottom edge to the top edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. This gluing process transforms the square into a torus (the surface of a doughnut) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Each point on this torus uniquely corresponds to an ordered pair of points on the loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

### Unordered Pairs and the Möbius Strip

The problem, however, requires considering *unordered* pairs of points (where (A, B) is considered the same as (B, A)) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. To represent unordered pairs, the unit square must be folded diagonally, identifying points (x, y) with (y, x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. This means the bottom edge of the square needs to be glued to the right edge, but with a specific orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. This complex gluing, which involves a twist, results in the formation of a [[understanding_mbius_strips_and_klein_bottles | Möbius strip]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

The [[understanding_mbius_strips_and_klein_bottles | Möbius strip]] is thus the natural geometric representation of all unordered pairs of points on a closed loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. Notably, the single edge of the Möbius strip (often highlighted in red) corresponds to pairs where both points are the same (e.g., (x, x)) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

## The Proof: Möbius Strip's Self-Intersection

Now, the connection between the Möbius strip and the inscribed rectangle problem becomes clear. The 3D surface generated by mapping pairs of points (midpoint `m`, distance `d`) can be viewed as a continuous mapping of the [[understanding_mbius_strips_and_klein_bottles | Möbius strip]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

When pairs of points on the loop are very close, the `d` value (height) is small, and the plotted point is near the loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. For pairs like (x, x) (where `d` is zero), the plotted point lies *exactly* on the original loop in the xy-plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Since the edge of the [[understanding_mbius_strips_and_klein_bottles | Möbius strip]] represents these (x, x) pairs, mapping the Möbius strip onto this surface means its edge *must* be mapped onto the original loop in the xy-plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

This leads to the crucial topological argument:
> There is no way to continuously map the [[understanding_mbius_strips_and_klein_bottles | Möbius strip]] such that its edge is placed directly onto a two-dimensional loop without forcing the strip itself to intersect itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

If the [[understanding_mbius_strips_and_kin_bottles | Möbius strip]] intersects itself during this mapping, it implies that two *distinct* pairs of points on the original loop map to the same point in 3D space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. This means these two distinct pairs share the same midpoint and are the same distance apart, thereby confirming the existence of an inscribed rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

The necessity of the Möbius strip's self-intersection when its edge is fixed to a plane is a fundamental property of [[topological surfaces and their properties | topological surfaces and their properties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. This elegant proof demonstrates how abstract topological concepts, like the [[understanding_mbius_strips_and_klein_bottles | Möbius strip]] and its embedding properties, can be directly applied to solve concrete problems in geometry, showcasing the true power and relevance of [[topology and its significance | topology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

Mathematics often seduces with the beauty of [[geometric_reasoning_in_higher_dimensions | reasoning geometrically]] in two and three dimensions, offering a clear interplay between numbers and spatial concepts that our visual cortex processes effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. For instance, a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin can be conceptualized as all pairs of numbers `x` and `y` satisfying `x² + y² = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This interplay is valuable because facts that appear opaque in a purely analytic context often become clear geometrically, and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This channel, for example, has benefited from this connection, especially regarding sums of squares, circles, and spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, as seen in videos about [[geometric_intuition_of_pi | Pi and number theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> or visualizing Pythagorean triples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The ability to frame analytic facts geometrically is extremely useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

However, this "tease" turns frustrating when exploring questions involving quadruplets, quintuplets, or 100-tuples of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Our intuitions about geometry, constrained by physical space, struggle, and the valuable back-and-forth between numerical and spatial reasoning is lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. While mathematicians, computer scientists, and physicists regularly deal with problems framed in terms of lists of more than three numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, the standard approach relies on analogy with two and three dimensions, primarily using analytic reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## A Hybrid Approach: Sliders and "Real Estate"

A hybrid method aims to make analytic reasoning more visual in a way that generalizes to arbitrarily high dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This approach focuses on [[geometric_reasoning_and_sphere_surface_area | higher dimensional spheres]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. For example, a four-dimensional sphere with radius one centered at the origin is the set of all quadruplets `x, y, z, w` where the sum of their squares is one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Visualizing projections of a 4D sphere into 3D can be confusing and doesn't genuinely reflect the experience of doing math with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

Instead, the core idea is to think very literally about the numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This involves picturing multiple vertical number lines with sliders, each representing a coordinate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Each configuration of these sliders represents a point in higher-dimensional space, and being on a unit sphere means the sum of the squares of these values is one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### The "Real Estate" Analogy

To understand movements on the sphere, it's helpful to consider the "real estate" analogy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Definition:** The value of `x²` (or `y²`, etc.) is thought of as the "real estate" belonging to that variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. For a unit sphere, all variables collectively share one unit of total real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Movement:** Moving around on a sphere corresponds to a constant exchange of this real estate between variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Cost:** "Real estate is cheap near zero and more expensive away from it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. For example, moving `x` from 1 to 0.9 (losing 0.19 real estate) requires `y` to move 0.44 units from 0 to gain the same amount of real estate, demonstrating that larger movements near zero yield less real estate change than smaller movements further from zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This aligns with the steep slope of a circle near its axes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   **Piston Dance:** Visualizing tick marks indicating equal units of real estate, sliders move more slowly away from zero because real estate is more expensive there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Distance:** The square root of the total real estate among all coordinates gives the distance from the origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

For a 3D sphere, adding a third slider for `z` means these three sliders still share one unit of real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Fixing one coordinate, say `x` at 0.5 (occupying 0.25 real estate), leaves `y` and `z` to trade off the remaining 0.75 units, creating a "piston dance" that corresponds to a circular slice of the sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. As `x` increases, less real estate is left for `y` and `z`, making the circular slice smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. When `x` reaches 1, no real estate is left, forcing `y` and `z` to 0, representing a singularity point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. This provides a "bug on the surface" perspective, understanding local movements rather than a global view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

In four dimensions and higher, the global spatial visual is lost, but the fundamental rules of real estate exchange persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Fixing one slider now means taking a slice of the 4D sphere to get a 3D sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

## A Counter-Intuitive [[challenges_in_solving_geometric_problems | Geometric Problem]]: The Inner Sphere Radius

To highlight the value of this visual-analytic tactic, consider a famous example where 2D/3D analogies fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>: finding the radius of an inner sphere tangent to corner spheres within an `n`-dimensional hypercube.

### The Setup

Imagine an `n`-dimensional hypercube whose corners are at `(±1, ±1, ..., ±1)`. At each of its `2^n` vertices, a sphere with radius 1 is centered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. The goal is to find the radius of a central sphere, also centered at the origin, that is just large enough to be tangent to these corner spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

#### 2 Dimensions

For a 2x2 box, the distance from the origin to a corner (e.g., `(1,1)`) is `sqrt(1² + 1²) = sqrt(2)` (approx. 1.414) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Subtracting the radius of a corner circle (which is 1), the inner circle's radius is `sqrt(2) - 1` (approx. 0.414) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. This seems reasonable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

Using sliders, for a corner circle centered at `(1,-1)`, the "real estate" for `x` depends on its distance from 1, and for `y`, its distance from -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. The point of tangency between the inner circle and a corner circle occurs when the `x` and `y` coordinates are equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. This means that at the point closest to the origin on a corner circle, the real estate (measured from the origin `0,0`) is shared evenly between `x` and `y` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. In this 2D case, `x` and `y` values dip below 0.5 in this configuration, so `x² + y²` will be less than `0.5² + 0.5²` (i.e., less than 0.5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

#### 3 Dimensions

For a 2x2x2 cube, the distance from the origin to a corner (e.g., `(1,1,1)`) is `sqrt(1² + 1² + 1²) = sqrt(3)` (approx. 1.73) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. The inner sphere's radius is `sqrt(3) - 1` (approx. 0.73) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. This also seems reasonable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

With sliders, considering a corner sphere centered at `(1,1,1)`, the point closest to the origin is where `x, y,` and `z` are equal and moving towards 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. Since `0.5` would only account for `0.5² = 0.25` real estate per coordinate, and there are three coordinates, they need to be further out to account for `1/3` of the total real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. At this tangent point, measured from `0,0,0`, the total real estate `x² + y² + z²` is less than `0.75` (since each `x,y,z` is less than `0.5`, so each `x²,y²,z²` is less than `0.25`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. The inner sphere is still smaller than the corner spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

#### 4 Dimensions

For a 2x2x2x2 hypercube, there are 16 vertices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. Focusing on the corner at `(1,1,1,1)`, the point closest to the origin is where all four coordinates are exactly halfway between 1 and 0 (i.e., `0.5`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

*   **Calculation:** The distance from the origin to `(1,1,1,1)` is `sqrt(1² + 1² + 1² + 1²) = sqrt(4) = 2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. Subtracting the corner sphere's radius of 1, the inner sphere's radius is `2 - 1 = 1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.
*   **Slider Insight:** When `x=y=z=w=0.5`, each coordinate has `0.5² = 0.25` units of real estate with respect to `(1,1,1,1)` (as a unit sphere centered there). When measured from the origin `(0,0,0,0)`, each coordinate still has `0.5² = 0.25` real estate. Summing them up, `0.25 * 4 = 1` total real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

This means that in four dimensions, the inner sphere has precisely the same size (radius 1) as the corner spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. This counter-intuitive result implies the inner sphere *touches* the 2x2x2x2 box, as a point like `(1,0,0,0)` is on the inner sphere (since `1²+0²+0²+0²=1`) and touches the box face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. This is a purely four-dimensional phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>.

#### 5 Dimensions

For a 2x2x2x2x2 hypercube (32 corner spheres) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>, the point closest to the origin on a corner sphere `(1,1,1,1,1)` is where all five coordinates split the real estate evenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. Here, each coordinate is slightly *higher* than 0.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

*   **Calculation:** The distance from the origin to `(1,1,1,1,1)` is `sqrt(5)`. Subtracting 1, the inner sphere's radius is `sqrt(5) - 1` (approx. 1.24) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.
*   **Slider Insight:** If each coordinate were 0.5, the total real estate would be `0.25 * 5 = 1.25`, which is too much for a unit sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. The sliders must be pulled further towards 0. In this configuration, viewed from the origin, the total real estate (`x² + y² + z² + w² + v²`) is *more* than one unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.
This means the inner sphere's radius (approx. 1.24) is *larger* than the corner spheres' radius of 1, causing it to poke outside the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.

#### 10 Dimensions

Jumping to ten dimensions, where points have ten coordinates and a unit sphere means one unit of real estate is shared among them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. The point of the corner sphere closest to the origin is where all ten coordinates split the real estate evenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>.

*   **Calculation:** The distance from the origin to a corner `(1,1,...,1)` is `sqrt(10)`. Subtracting 1, the inner sphere's radius is `sqrt(10) - 1` (approx. 2.16) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.
*   **Slider Insight:** This configuration appears "very far away from the origin" on the sliders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. The inner sphere has a very large amount of real estate, with its radius more than twice as big as the corner spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.
This 10-dimensional inner sphere's diameter (approx. 4.32) is larger than the outer bounding box (which is 4x4...x4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>, meaning it pokes outside the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. The face of the box is always two units from the origin, regardless of dimension, because it involves moving along a single axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. However, the corner point `(1,1,...,1)` gets increasingly far from the center as dimensions increase, adding a full unit of real estate for each dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. As dimensions increase, the inner sphere grows without bound, and the proportion of the inner sphere inside the box exponentially decreases towards zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.

## Benefits and Limitations

This slider method for [[geometric_reasoning_in_higher_dimensions | reasoning in higher dimensions]] helps to demystify concepts, making discussions about higher dimensions less metaphysical and more like how mathematicians approach the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. It encourages probing into other properties of high-dimensional shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>. While the method is limited (like a "bug on the surface" view, only getting a feel for one point at a time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a> and is coordinate-dependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>, it offers a concrete foothold for thinking about complex shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>.

Although viewing things with sliders might seem no different from purely [[mathematical_intuition_versus_analysis | analytic reasoning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>, this small move makes it much more possible to "play with the thought of a high-dimensional point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. Simple analogies like "real estate" can illuminate strange aspects of high dimensions, such as how far the corner of a box is from its center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. This approach is a faithful reflection of what doing math in higher dimensions truly entails, effectively redesigning the instruments of analytic reasoning to better leverage our brains' capacity for [[importance_of_visual_intuition_for_learning_linear_algebra | image processing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>. Even if direct visualization is impossible, one can still think visually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>.

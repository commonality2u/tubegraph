The seemingly simple puzzle of two colliding blocks calculating pi is secretly connected to [[Quantum mechanics basics for beginners | quantum computing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, specifically to [[Grover's Algorithm for Search | Grover's Algorithm for Search]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This connection was not known at the time the original video on the topic was posted in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## The Underlying Connection

The reason the mass ratio in the block collision puzzle needs to be a power of 100 (instead of 10 for a base-10 expectation) to reveal the digits of pi is intimately connected to the fact that [[Grover's Algorithm for Search | search algorithms]] can be faster on [[Quantum mechanics basics for beginners | quantum computers]] than on classical computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

The key to understanding this parallel lies in the "state space" diagram used to solve the block collision problem. This diagram, which tracks the velocities of the blocks as a single point moving on a circle, holds within it the core connection to the [[Quantum mechanics basics for beginners | quantum computing]] parallel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05">[00:09:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Furthermore, the significance of the square root in the slope of the momentum line (which is the negative square root of the big mass divided by the small mass) becomes particularly important when considering the [[Quantum mechanics basics for beginners | quantum computing]] case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57">[00:12:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

The solution to the block collision puzzle is secretly mirrored inside an algorithm found within [[Quantum mechanics basics for beginners | quantum computing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:34">[00:26:34]</a>.

## Future Exploration

A more detailed explanation of this connection, including the basics of [[Quantum mechanics basics for beginners | quantum computing]] and [[Grover's Algorithm for Search | Grover's Algorithm]], will be provided in a separate video, created with theoretical physicist Adam Brown, who first noticed this intriguing link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20">[05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24">[05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27">[05:27]</a>.

## The Value of Abstraction

Stripping away the complexities of the real world in mathematical problems, as was done for the idealized block collision puzzle, is not merely out of laziness or apathy for applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:51">[00:26:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:53">[00:26:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:55">[00:26:55]</a>. Rather, distilling a problem to its core essence can reveal hidden connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:57">[00:26:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.

A difficult problem in one context, which might appear deeply confusing, can sometimes become clearer when viewed through the lens of another setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:06">[00:27:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:10">[00:27:10]</a>. Much of the progress in mathematics throughout history has involved developing an increasingly rich web of these hidden connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:14">[00:27:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:18">[00:27:18]</a>.

[[baynes_theorem_and_its_significance | Bayes' theorem]], a crucial formula in probability, has diverse applications, including its use in treasure hunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Historic Application

In the 1980s, a small team led by Tommy Thompson employed [[understanding_bayes_theorem_through_examples | Bayesian search tactics]] to locate a ship that had sunk approximately 150 years earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This successful endeavor led to the discovery of a vessel carrying gold valued at $700 million in contemporary terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This real-world application highlights the significance of Bayes' theorem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

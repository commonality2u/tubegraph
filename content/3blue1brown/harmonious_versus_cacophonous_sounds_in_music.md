The distinction between harmonious and cacophonous musical sounds can be understood by analyzing the ratio of their frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## The Challenge of Harmony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>

When two musical notes are played, their frequencies are compared by a ratio, R. If the first note is 220 Hz, and the second note's frequency is R times the first, the task is to determine whether R results in a pleasant (harmonious) or unpleasant (cacophonous) sound without listening to the notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. For example, a ratio of 1.5 (3/2) sounds harmonious, while the square root of 2 sounds cacophonous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Early Theories: Rationality and Simplicity

### The Pythagorean View
Historically, figures like Pythagoras suggested that two notes sound good together when their frequency ratio is a [[Rational versus irrational numbers in music | rational number]] (e.g., 3/2, 4/3, 8/5) and bad when it's [[Rational versus irrational numbers in music | irrational]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This theory posits that a [[Rational versus irrational numbers in music | rational]] ratio creates a detectable pattern in the beats, which the brain interprets as a rhythm, leading to a pleasant sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Complexity of Rational Numbers
However, this simple rule is insufficient, as many [[Rational versus irrational numbers in music | rational numbers]], such as 211/198 or 1093/826, result in cacophonous sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The issue is that these [[Rational versus irrational numbers in music | rational numbers]] are "more complicated," preventing the ear from picking up on the beat pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

A simple way to measure the complexity of a [[Rational versus irrational numbers in music | rational number]] is by the size of its denominator when written in reduced form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Therefore, a refined rule might suggest that harmonious sounds arise from [[Rational versus irrational numbers in music | rational numbers]] with low denominators, perhaps less than 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Modern Tuning and Proximity to Rationality

Even the refined rule is incomplete, as many notes sound good together even if their frequency ratio is [[Rational versus irrational numbers in music | irrational]], provided it is sufficiently close to a harmonious [[Rational versus irrational numbers in music | rational number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

A prime example is the tuning of pianos, which are not tuned using strict [[Rational versus irrational numbers in music | rational intervals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Instead, each half-step increase in frequency corresponds to multiplying the original frequency by the 12th root of 2, an [[Rational versus irrational numbers in music | irrational number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   For instance, a musical fifth, which is ideally a 3/2 ratio, is played on a piano as 2^(7/12). This is [[Rational versus irrational numbers in music | irrational]] but very close to 3/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   Similarly, a musical fourth corresponds to 2^(5/12), which is very close to 4/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

The effectiveness of the 12-note chromatic scale lies in the tendency of powers of the 12th root of 2 to be within a 1% margin of error of simple [[Rational versus irrational numbers in music | rational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

Thus, a frequency ratio R results in a harmonious sound if it is sufficiently close to a [[Rational versus irrational numbers in music | rational number]] with a sufficiently small denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. The "closeness" depends on the listener's discernment, and the "smallness" of the denominator depends on the intricacy of harmonic patterns their ear can perceive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

## The Musical Savant and Measure Theory

Consider a hypothetical "musical savant" who finds pleasure in *all* [[Rational versus irrational numbers in music | rational ratios]], even those considered highly complicated and cacophonous by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. The question arises: would such a savant find *all* ratios R between 1 and 2 harmonious, even the [[Rational versus irrational numbers in music | irrational]] ones? After all, any real number can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a [[Rational versus irrational numbers in music | rational number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

This leads to a foundational result in measure theory concerning covering [[Rational versus irrational numbers in music | rational numbers]] with open intervals, which helps formalize the idea that even for the savant, harmonious numbers remain rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

In this mathematical challenge, it's possible to cover all [[Rational versus irrational numbers in music | rational numbers]] between 0 and 1 with infinitely many open intervals whose total length sums to less than 1, or even to an arbitrarily small positive number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. This is achieved by enumerating the [[Rational versus irrational numbers in music | rational numbers]] and assigning each a progressively smaller interval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

This implies that while [[Rational versus irrational numbers in music | rational numbers]] are "dense" in the real numbers (meaning any continuous stretch contains infinitely many [[Rational versus irrational numbers in music | rational numbers]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, the majority of numbers (like the square root of 2/2) remain uncovered by these small intervals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. The intervals covering [[Rational versus irrational numbers in music | rational numbers]] with large denominators (which appear later in the enumerated list) shrink very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

Therefore, for an [[Rational versus irrational numbers in music | irrational number]] like the square root of 2/2, the fact that it is not covered by these "harmonious" intervals formalizes the idea that the only [[Rational versus irrational numbers in music | rational numbers]] close to it have large denominators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. This suggests that the square root of 2/2 is cacophonous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

If we shift this concept to the interval from 1 to 2, and use a very small total length for the intervals (e.g., 0.01), almost all covered numbers would be harmonious or close to harmonious [[Rational versus irrational numbers in music | rational numbers]] (e.g., 2^(7/12) close to 3/2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. The cacophonous numbers in this 1% would be those [[Rational versus irrational numbers in music | rational numbers]] with high denominators and irrationals very close to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

The connection between this mathematical paradox and musical harmony suggests that even for a savant who appreciates all [[Rational versus irrational numbers in music | rational numbers]], only a small fraction of all possible ratios between 1 and 2 would be perceived as harmonious, provided her tolerance for error decreases exponentially for more complicated [[Rational versus irrational numbers in music | rational numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. This implies that harmonious numbers are rare, even for the most acute musical sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

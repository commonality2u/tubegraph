Linear algebra is a fundamental subject required for nearly any technical discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Despite its widespread requirement, it is often poorly understood by students taking it for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. While students may learn to compute operations like matrix multiplication, determinants, cross products, or eigenvalues, they often lack a true [[understanding_linear_algebra | understanding]] of *why* these operations are defined as they are or *what* they truly represent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Geometric vs. Numeric Understanding

A key issue identified in the learning of linear algebra is the disconnect between numerical proficiency and [[visual_understanding_of_linear_transformations | geometric intuition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Students often become well-practiced in the numerical operations of matrices but remain only vaguely aware of the underlying geometric principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

There is a fundamental difference between [[geometric_versus_numeric_understanding_in_linear_algebra | understanding linear algebra]] on a numeric level and on a geometric level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>:
*   **[[visual_intuition_of_linear_transformations | Geometric understanding]]** allows one to judge which tools to use for specific problems, comprehend *why* they work, and accurately interpret results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Numeric understanding** enables the actual application and execution of these tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## [[challenges_students_face_in_learning_linear_algebra | Challenges Without Visual Intuition]]

Without a solid foundation in [[visual_understanding_of_linear_transformations | geometric understanding]], problems can go unnoticed until students delve deeper into fields such as computer science, engineering, statistics, economics, or even pure mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. In classes or jobs that assume fluency with linear algebra, the application of the field by professors or colleagues might seem like "utter magic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. They might intuitively know the right tool to use and roughly what the answer will look like, appearing as computational wizardry if one assumes they are merely crunching numbers in their head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Analogy with Trigonometry
An analogy can be drawn with learning the sine function in trigonometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. If one were only taught the sine function as an infinite polynomial (how calculators evaluate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>), and its relation to triangles was vague or not the focus, then taking a physics course later where sines and cosines are frequently used would be intimidating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This could lead to a feeling of being slow or unintelligent, believing that only those with "computers for brains" are suited for physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

The situation with linear algebra is similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Benefits of [[visual_intuition_in_calculus | Visual Intuition]]

Fortunately, much like trigonometry, linear algebra is underpinned by a handful of [[visual_intuition_of_linear_transformations | visual intuitions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Unlike the extreme sine example, the connection between computation and these visual intuitions in linear algebra is typically quite straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. When these intuitions are grasped and the relationship between geometry and numbers is truly understood, the subject's details and its practical [[applications_of_linear_algebra_concepts | applications]] become much more reasonable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

While many professors strive to convey this geometric understanding, courses often dedicate a disproportionate amount of time to the numerical side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. In modern practice, computers handle the numerical computations, leaving humans to focus on the conceptual aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## [[educational_resources_for_teaching_linear_algebra | Educational Resources]]

To address this gap, [[educational_resources_for_teaching_linear_algebra | resources]] aim to create animated series that illustrate these intuitions, covering topics from the basics of vectors to the core essence of linear algebra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. The objective is not to teach the full subject, but to establish the correct intuitions, making future learning more productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Such resources also serve as a quick brush-up for students needing to solidify their understanding for courses that assume fluency in linear algebra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

Holography is a technique that records and reconstructs an entire three-dimensional (3D) scene, creating a surreal illusion of objects existing behind a piece of glass or film when, in reality, nothing is there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. This phenomenon allows observers to move their heads and see light play off the objects in different ways, experiencing a continuous range of perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

The principle behind this was discovered by [[history_of_holography_and_dennis_gabors_contributions | Dennis Gabor]] in 1947, though it only became practical decades later with the invention of lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. For his groundbreaking work, Gabor was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

## Types of Holograms

The simplest type of hologram is a **transmission hologram**, where the scene is visible only when illuminated with a laser from behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:58:00">[35:58:00]</a>. More advanced variants, such as **white light reflection holograms**, can be illuminated using ordinary light that reflects off the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:06:00">[36:06:00]</a>.

## The Recording Process

The fundamental goal of recording a [[what_is_a_hologram | hologram]] is to recreate the entire light field surrounding a scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. This differs significantly from ordinary photography, like a pinhole camera, which captures a scene from only a single viewing angle, losing vast amounts of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

To achieve this, holography must record not only the amplitude (brightness) of light, but also its **phase** (where the wave is in its cycle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. Normal photography, which exposes film based on the average intensity (proportional to the square of the amplitude), loses all information about the phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

### Recording Phase with a Reference Wave

To record the phase, a second beam of light, called the **reference wave**, is shined onto the film alongside the light from the scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. Both the reference wave and the light from the scene (the **object wave**) must have the same frequency, which necessitates the use of a laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.

A typical setup uses a beam splitter to divide a single laser beam:
1.  One half, the **object wave**, is spread out, bounces off the scene, and then hits the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.
2.  The other half, the **reference wave**, is also spread out but travels directly to the film without interacting with the scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.

These two waves then interfere at the plane of the film, creating an exposure pattern that is highly sensitive to the phase of the object wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. Where the object wave and reference wave are in sync, they [[interference_and_diffraction_in_holography | constructively interfere]], resulting in high exposure. Where they are out of sync, they [[interference_and_diffraction_in_holography | destructively interfere]], leading to low exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.

### The Exposure Pattern

The resulting exposure pattern on the film does not resemble the original objects; instead, it looks like a "complete mess" of rapidly oscillating fringes (points of high and low exposure) when viewed under a microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>. This pattern is incredibly sensitive to even the tiniest movements of the objects in the scene during recording. A shift comparable to the wavelength of light (a few hundred nanometers) can completely alter the pattern, necessitating extreme stillness during the exposure process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>.

Holographic film requires extremely high resolution—many thousands of lines per millimeter—to faithfully record these minute variations, compared to standard photographic film which resolves around 10 to 100 lines per millimeter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:31:00">[33:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:48:00">[33:48:00]</a>. This high resolution is crucial for reconstructing the object beam at various viewing angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:54:00">[33:54:00]</a>.

## The Reconstruction Process

The "magic" of holography occurs during reconstruction: if all objects are removed from the scene and only the original reference beam is shined onto the exposed film, it produces a complete recreation of the object wave, as if the scene and object beam were still present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>.

Even a very small circle cut from a [[what_is_a_hologram | hologram]] can, when viewed with the reference beam, show essentially every part of the recorded scene, though not all at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>. This demonstrates that the information about the entire scene is distributed across the entire film.

### Simple Case: A Single Point Object

To understand reconstruction, consider the simplest object: a single point floating in 3D space. The object wave from this point propagates radially. If the reference wave is a plane wave coming in perpendicular to the film, the interference pattern recorded on the film will be a series of **concentric rings** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>. This pattern is known as a **Fresnel zone plate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:47:00">[15:47:00]</a>. The spacing between these fringes gets smaller further from the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a>.

When the reference wave is shined through this Fresnel zone plate pattern, each small region of the film acts like a [[interference_and_diffraction_in_holography | diffraction grating]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:45:00">[16:45:00]</a>. A key relationship for [[interference_and_diffraction_in_holography | diffraction gratings]] is that the spacing between slits (D) multiplied by the sine of the angle of the diffracted beam (theta) equals the wavelength of light (lambda): **D * sin(theta) = lambda** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:21:00">[22:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:49:00">[22:49:00]</a>. For the Fresnel zone plate, the spacing between fringes (D) multiplied by the sine of the angle of the line connecting the film point to the original object location (theta prime) also equals the wavelength of light: **D * sin(theta prime) = lambda** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:17:00">[26:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:22:00">[26:22:00]</a>.

Therefore, one of the diffracted beams from the zone plate exactly matches the angle of the light that would have come from the original object point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:56:00">[26:56:00]</a>. As an observer moves their head, this apparent bright spot on the glass moves with them, creating the illusion of a floating point of light behind the glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:46:00">[27:46:00]</a>.

### Artifacts in Reconstruction

Holograms generally recreate three types of light waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:57:00">[28:57:00]</a>:
1.  **A scaled copy of the reference wave** (the "zeroth order beam"), which appears as a bright glow behind the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:01:00">[29:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:04:00">[29:04:00]</a>. This can be mitigated by shining the reference beam in at an angle during recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:19:00">[28:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:07:00">[30:07:00]</a>.
2.  **A copy of the object wave** (one of the "first order beams"), which is the desired reconstructed scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:08:00">[29:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:13:00">[29:13:00]</a>.
3.  **A "conjugate image"** (the "other first order beam"), which appears as a reflected, warped version of the original scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21:00">[29:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:41:00">[29:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:55:00">[29:55:00]</a>. Like the zeroth order beam, this artifact can be separated from the desired reconstructed object wave by using an angled reference beam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:07:00">[30:07:00]</a>.

For materials whose opacity follows a sine wave pattern rather than a binary one (light either passes completely or is completely blocked), there are no higher order diffracted beams beyond the zeroth and first order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:38:00">[30:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:50:00">[30:50:00]</a>.

## Generalization and Limitations

While the single-point explanation provides intuition, complex scenes involve much more intricate interference patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:37:00">[31:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:05:00">[32:05:00]</a>. A scene with many points would result in a pattern that looks like random noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:28:00">[32:28:00]</a>. However, the principle remains: the diffraction effect of the recorded pattern, when illuminated by the reference beam, recreates the light field of the original scene, enabling the illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:36:00">[32:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:53:00">[32:53:00]</a>.

Crucially, a [[what_is_a_hologram | hologram]] captures how complex objects like a glass Klein bottle refract and distort light from objects behind them, not just how individual points reflect light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:42:00">[34:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:54:00">[34:54:00]</a>. This level of optical detail cannot be explained merely by summing individual points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:57:00">[34:57:00]</a>.

For white light reflection holograms, the thickness of the film and variations in exposure throughout that thickness become relevant for filtering appropriate wavelengths during reconstruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:32:00">[36:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:43:00">[36:43:00]</a>.

## Formal Explanation (Technical Appendix)

The general explanation for why holography works can be elegantly demonstrated using complex numbers to represent light waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:33:00">[38:33:00]</a>. A complex number can encode both the amplitude (magnitude) and phase (angle) of a wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:44:00">[39:44:00]</a>.

Let R be the reference wave and O be the object wave, both represented as complex values at each point on the film. The combined wave is R + O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:46:00">[38:46:00]</a>. The exposure pattern (opacity of the film) is proportional to the square of the amplitude of this combined wave, which can be written as the magnitude squared of (R + O), or (R + O) multiplied by its complex conjugate (R* + O*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:56:00">[38:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:22:00">[40:22:00]</a>.

During reconstruction, the reference wave (R) is shined through the exposed film. The wave immediately after the film can be represented as R times (1 - opacity). By substituting the expression for opacity and expanding, the resulting wave (on the other side of the film) includes three key components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:54:00">[40:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:16:00">[41:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:23:00">[42:23:00]</a>:

1.  **A scaled copy of the reference wave (R)**: This corresponds to the zeroth order beam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:35:00">[42:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:42:00">[42:42:00]</a>.
2.  **A scaled copy of the object wave (O)**: This is the desired reconstructed image of the scene, regardless of its complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:55:00">[42:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:04:00">[43:04:00]</a>. This corresponds to one of the first order beams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:26:00">[43:26:00]</a>.
3.  **A term involving the complex conjugate of the object wave (O*)**: This represents the conjugate image, which appears as a reflected and warped version of the scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:31:00">[43:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:37:00">[43:37:00]</a>.

This algebraic derivation shows that a copy of the object wave is indeed present on the other side of the film, without making assumptions about the complexity of the object or reference waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:03:00">[44:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:10:00">[44:10:00]</a>. The ability to reconstruct a 3D scene from a 2D film relies on the fundamental property that light obeys laws where the state of a light wave in 3D space is sufficiently constrained by its value on a 2D boundary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:50:00">[45:50:00]</a>.

The universe of mathematics contains objects that are peculiar and reflect something fundamental, even if they seem arbitrary at first glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. One such object is the Monster group, whose size is roughly 8x10<sup>53</sup>, comparable to the number of atoms in the planet Jupiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. To understand what the Monster group is, it's necessary to delve into [[introduction_to_group_theory | group theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Groups and Symmetry
[[introduction_to_group_theory | Group theory]] is a field dedicated to codifying the idea of [[group_theory_and_the_idea_of_symmetry | symmetry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. When something is symmetric, it means certain actions can be applied to it that leave it looking the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. For example, a face can be reflected, or a snowflake can be rotated 60 degrees or flipped along various axes, and still appear identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. A collection of all such actions forms a group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The "do nothing" action is always considered part of a group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

When describing these actions, there's always an implicit structure being preserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. For instance, the 24 rotations of a cube that leave it looking the same form a group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. If reflections are allowed, the group becomes larger with 48 actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Loosening the sense of structure, such as considering faces to be shuffled around, results in much larger and more complex groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

The loosest sense of structure involves a collection of points where any permutation (shuffling) is considered a symmetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. These "permutation groups" are unconstrained and can become very large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. For example, there are 6! (720) possible permutations of six objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. For 12 points, the number of permutations grows to about 479 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. [[the_concept_of_simple_groups_and_permutation_groups | Permutation groups]], denoted S-sub-n, play a crucial role in [[introduction_to_group_theory | group theory]] because they encompass all other groups in a certain sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. The sheer size of a group, like the 9x10<sup>159</sup> permutations of 101 objects, is not inherently interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Abstract Groups
Mathematicians typically define groups more abstractly than specific actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Just as the number 3 is an abstraction not tied to a specific triplet, elements of a group are abstract "things" that combine in defined ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This combination is referred to as a "multiplication" where one action follows another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. The entire multiplication table captures the inner structure of a group, abstracting it from any specific object it might act on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

An **isomorphism** is a one-to-one mapping between two groups that preserves their composition (multiplication) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. For example, the symmetries of a cube and the [[the_concept_of_simple_groups_and_permutation_groups | permutation group]] of four objects are isomorphic, meaning their multiplication tables are identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. This concept leads to the question of what "all the groups up to isomorphism" are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>, which is to ask: "What are all the ways that something can be symmetric?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

## Simple Groups and the Classification Project
The task of categorizing all finite groups is divided into two steps: finding all the simple groups, and finding all ways to combine them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. Analogous to prime numbers or atoms, [[the_concept_of_simple_groups_and_permutation_groups | simple groups]] are the finite groups that cannot be broken down further into compositions of smaller groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. Understanding the nature of these simple groups is crucial as they appear in various parts of mathematics, such as proving the impossibility of a general quintic formula for polynomial solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

The [[the_classification_of_finite_simple_groups | classification of finite simple groups]] is considered one of the most monumental achievements in the history of mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. After decades of work by hundreds of mathematicians and significant computer assistance, it was definitively completed by 2004, spanning tens of thousands of pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

The result of this classification is "absurd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>:
*   There are 18 distinct infinite families of simple groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. These include cyclic groups of prime order (symmetries of a regular polygon with a prime number of sides without flips) and certain [[the_concept_of_simple_groups_and_permutation_groups | permutation groups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.
*   In addition to these families, there are 26 "leftover" simple groups that do not fit the established patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. These are known as the **sporadic groups** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

## The Monster Group
The largest of the 26 sporadic groups is known as the **Monster group** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>, with the size mentioned at the outset (approximately 8x10<sup>53</sup>) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. The second largest is called the "baby monster group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

Twenty of these sporadic groups, including the baby monster, are considered "children" of the Monster group and were named the "happy family" by Robert Gries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. The remaining six sporadic groups, which don't fit even this pattern, are called "pariahs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. The whimsical naming reflects the complex and bizarre nature of these groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.

The existence of fundamental building blocks for symmetry that "abruptly stop" at this size is highly unusual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. While the Monster group is massive, its peculiar nature stems from its fundamental role as a simple group, not merely its size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

The object that the Monster group acts on, describing its symmetries, exists in an astounding 196,883 dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. Describing even one element of this group requires about 4 GB of data, which is computationally intensive despite larger groups having smaller computational descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

## The Mystery of Sporadic Groups and Monstrous Moonshine
The ultimate reason for the existence of the sporadic groups, especially the Monster, remains a mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. Despite their deeply fundamental nature to math and potentially physics, much about them is still not understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

In the 1970s, mathematician John McKay noticed a number very similar to 196,883 (one greater, 196,884) appearing in the series expansion of a fundamental function in a completely unrelated area of math: modular forms and elliptic functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. This striking coincidence, along with others, led to the playful coining of the term "moonshine" by John Conway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. This gave rise to the [[the_monstrous_moonshine_conjecture_and_its_implications | Monstrous Moonshine Conjecture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.

The [[the_monstrous_moonshine_conjecture_and_its_implications | Monstrous Moonshine Conjecture]] was proved by Richard Borcherds in 1992, establishing a profound connection between seemingly disparate areas of mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. Borcherds later won the Fields Medal partly due to the significance of this proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. Related to this moonshine is a connection between the Monster group and string theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>.

The Monster group serves as a reminder that fundamental mathematical objects are not always simple or clean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>; they exist by logical necessity, regardless of human understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.

An animation created by Paul Dstep aims to illustrate the [[distance measurement in the cosmos | distances to various objects in the cosmos]] by zooming out by a factor of 10 every three seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Depicting Cosmic Distances

The animation effectively demonstrates the immense [[distance measurement in the cosmos | distances]] involved in space. For instance, as one departs the solar system, there are numerous "seemingly blank orders of magnitude" before the first star is encountered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Limitations of Cosmic Perspective Visualizations

While informative, these kinds of [[powers of 10 zoom out | powers of 10 zoom outs]] can potentially [[limitations of cosmic perspective | undersell the true scale of the Universe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The implied camera position in such animations moves significantly faster than the cosmic speed limit, the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This can make distant objects, like other galaxies, appear almost accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. In reality, traveling to the nearest galaxy would take approximately 2.5 million years, even at the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Mapping the Distant Cosmos

To maintain scientific accuracy without resorting to artistic renditions of the universe, the creators of the zoom-out animation chose to end with a simple point cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This point cloud represents data from the [[Slone galactic survey and galaxy mapping | Slone galactic survey]], which essentially [[Slone galactic survey and galaxy mapping | maps]] the [[distance measurement in the cosmos | distances to various galaxies]] in many different directions in the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

It is remarkable that [[Astronomical observations and their impact on physics | mapping]] and studying patterns like the clusters and strands formed by billions of galaxies is possible, despite these galaxies being millions and billions of light-years away and beyond our direct grasp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This capability is a testament to the power of science and deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

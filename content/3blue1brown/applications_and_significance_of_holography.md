[[what_is_a_hologram | Holography]] is a special kind of recording taken on film that provides the illusion of looking through a window into a recorded three-dimensional scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:15">[01:54:15]</a>. Unlike an ordinary photograph that captures a scene from a single viewing angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>, a hologram stores an entire continuum of differing perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>. Every optical detail from all viewing angles is stored on a two-dimensional piece of film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:15">[01:35:15]</a>.

The goal of a hologram is to recreate the entire light field around a scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. This means capturing how light refracts through objects, reflects off surfaces, and appears from various viewpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. If the full state of this light field can be recreated, even when the original objects are absent, it produces a complete illusion of the scene being present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

## History of Holography
The principle behind holography was discovered by [[history_of_holography_and_dennis_gabors_contributions | Dennis Gabor]] in 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:06">[02:03:06]</a>. He made this fundamental insight while working on methods for electron microscopy, reportedly during a tennis match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. However, it was not until decades later, with the invention of lasers, that holography became practical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:15">[02:15:15]</a>. Gabor was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1971 for his discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. In his own reflections, Gabor described his discovery as "an exercise in serendipity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

## Types of Holograms
The simplest version is called a **transmission hologram** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. These holograms are visible only when illuminated with a laser from behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. More advanced variants include **white light reflection holograms**, which, as the name suggests, can be illuminated using ordinary light that reflects off them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. Transmission holograms have been possible since the late 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

## How Holograms Work
[[how_holograms_are_recorded_and_reconstructed | Holograms]] work by recording the light's phase, not just its amplitude, which is lost in ordinary photography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. This is achieved by interfering an "object wave" (light reflected from the scene) with a "reference wave" (a direct laser beam) at the film plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>. Both waves must have the same frequency, necessitating the use of a laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. The interference of these two waves creates an exposure pattern on the film that looks nothing like the original objects, instead appearing as rapidly oscillating fringes under a microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.

This exposure pattern is incredibly sensitive to even tiny movements of objects during recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. Shifts comparable to the light's wavelength (a few hundred nanometers) can completely alter the pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. Therefore, stillness is crucial during the minutes-long exposure process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.

For reconstruction, the objects and object beam are removed, and only the reference beam is shone onto the exposed film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>. This process produces a complete recreation of the object wave, giving the illusion that the scene is still present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. Even a small piece cut from the film can reconstruct the entire scene, though not all at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>.

### Interference and Diffraction
[[interference_and_diffraction_in_holography | Interference and diffraction]] are key principles. When recording a hologram of a simple point, the exposure pattern on the film is a **Fresnel zone plate**â€”a series of concentric rings that get closer together farther from the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>. This pattern records the three-dimensional coordinates of the point: the center for XY coordinates and ring spacing for the Z coordinate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10:00">[16:10:00]</a>.

During reconstruction, shining the reference wave through this zone plate causes diffraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>. Each point on the film acts like a diffraction grating, splitting the wave into distinct beams, one of which precisely matches the angle of light from the original object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:42:00">[26:42:00]</a>. This creates the illusion of the point being behind the glass, appearing to move as the observer's head moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:11:00">[27:11:00]</a>.

A practical requirement for holography is extremely high-resolution film. Standard Polaroid film resolves around 10 lines per millimeter, and microfilm about 100, but hologram film needs thousands of lines per millimeter to faithfully record the very narrow fringes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:31:00">[33:31:00]</a>.

### Conjugate Image
A notable artifact in holography is the **conjugate image** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:39:00">[28:39:00]</a>. When reconstructing, besides the desired object wave and a scaled copy of the reference wave, a third component appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:54:00">[28:54:00]</a>. For a single point, this looks like a reflection of that point through the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21:00">[29:21:00]</a>. More generally, it appears as a refocused, reflected version of the full object on the opposite side of the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:31:00">[30:31:00]</a>. Early in holography, the conjugate image often muddied the view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:57:00">[29:57:00]</a>. However, using a reference beam that shines on the film at an angle can cleanly separate the reconstructed object wave from this artifact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:07:00">[30:07:00]</a>.

### Mathematical Explanation
A more formal explanation of holography involves representing light waves as complex numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:33:00">[38:33:00]</a>. The exposure pattern is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the combined reference (R) and object (O) waves, which can be written as the magnitude squared of (R + O) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:50:00">[38:50:00]</a>. When the reference wave (R) passes through the exposed film during reconstruction, the resulting wave on the other side can be expressed algebraically. This expression reveals three main components:
1.  A scaled copy of the reference wave (zeroth order beam) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:35:00">[42:35:00]</a>.
2.  A scaled copy of the object wave (the desired reconstructed image) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:55:00">[42:55:00]</a>.
3.  A term involving the complex conjugate of the object wave, which corresponds to the conjugate image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:31:00">[43:31:00]</a>.

This mathematical framework makes no assumptions about the simplicity of the object or reference waves, showing that the object wave will always be reconstructed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:10:00">[44:10:00]</a>. The ability to store a 3D scene on 2D film relies on the principle that the state of a light wave in 3D space is sufficiently constrained by its value on a 2D boundary, as light obeys regular physical laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:40:00">[45:40:00]</a>.

## Broader Significance and Applications
The significance of holography extends beyond an art form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:51:00">[36:51:00]</a>. [[applications_of_fourier_transform | Applications of holography]] include:
*   **Interferometry**: Holograms are relevant to interferometry, a technique that uses wave interference to measure extremely tiny distances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:21:00">[37:21:00]</a>. By superimposing a hologram with the original scene, dark stripes appear from tiny shifts in position, which can be used to measure the size of those shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:02:00">[37:02:00]</a>.
*   **Wavefront Reconstruction**: Being able to record and reproduce an entire wavefront is a useful tool for various experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:32:00">[37:32:00]</a>.
*   **Time-Varying Scenes**: Techniques exist to make changes in a scene over time visible as the hologram is viewed from different angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:14:00">[36:14:00]</a>.
*   **Computer Graphics**: It is possible to take a 3D computer graphics model and produce a hologram of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:21:00">[36:21:00]</a>.

Dennis Gabor's Nobel Prize underscores the profound importance of holography in physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:51:00">[36:51:00]</a>. For those interested in a deeper look, Gabor's Nobel Prize lecture is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:40:00">[37:40:00]</a>.

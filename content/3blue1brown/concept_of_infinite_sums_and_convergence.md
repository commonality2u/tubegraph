The concept of an infinite sum, such as 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 and continuing indefinitely, might initially seem nonsensical. However, there's a mathematical sense in which such a sum can equal negative 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. To understand this, it's necessary to explore the definition of [[infinite_sums_and_approximations | infinite sums]], particularly those that appear to "make sense" (convergent sums), and then consider how new mathematical frameworks can make seemingly "crazy" equations comprehensible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Discovering Convergent Infinite Sums

Imagine an early mathematician attempting to understand sums like 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 and so on, extending to infinity, and asserting that this sum equals 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. To define what it means to add infinitely many things, one might ponder the nature of distances between objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Consider two objects placed on a number line, one at 0 and the other at 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. If the first object marches towards the second, halving the distance between them with each step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, the positions it touches would be 1/2, then 1/2 + 1/4, then 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Each number in this sequence is a [[finite and infinite mathematical constructs | finite]] sum of inverse powers of 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Geometrically, these numbers clearly approach 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This leads to the desire to state that 1 is equivalent to some kind of infinite sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

Initially, one might dismiss this idea as impossible, as no human, computer, or physical entity can perform infinitely many additions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. However, approaching math with "healthy irreverence" allows for making sense of such apparent nonsense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Defining "Approach" for Infinite Sums

The key to defining [[infinite_sums_and_approximations | infinite sums]] lies in dissecting how the initial "fuzzy discovery" was made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. No actual infinite operations were performed; rather, a list of numbers was generated from perfectly reasonable [[finite and infinite mathematical constructs | finite]] sums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. The crucial observation was that these numbers "approach" 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

Simply stating that the distance between each number and 1 gets smaller is insufficient, as the distance to other numbers (e.g., 2) also gets smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. What makes 1 special is that the numbers can get *arbitrarily close* to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This means that no matter how small a desired distance (e.g., one-hundredth, one-millionth), if one goes far enough down the list of numbers, they will eventually fall within that tiny distance of 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This refined understanding is a fundamental concept in [[introduction_to_limits_in_calculus | limits]].

This leads to the formal definition of an infinite sum equalling a number *x*:
> An infinite sum equals a number *x* if, when a list of numbers is generated by cutting off the sum at [[finite and infinite mathematical constructs | finite]] points, the numbers in this list approach *x* in the sense that no matter how small the distance chosen, at some point down the list, all subsequent numbers start falling within that distance of *x* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

This definition, though seemingly obvious in retrospect, was an incredibly clever advancement in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## Generalizing Infinite Sums

Once a definition for [[convergence_and_divergence_of_taylor_series | convergent infinite sums]] is established, one can explore more general truths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. For instance, instead of halving the interval, one could cut it into pieces of size *p* and (1 - *p*), where *p* is any number between 0 and 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Repeating this process leads to the well-known fact that 0.9 repeating equals 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. With the established definition of [[infinite_sums_and_approximations | infinite sums]], "to approach" and "to equal" mean the same thing for convergent series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

More generally, by continuously cutting the rightmost piece into proportions *p* and (1 - *p*), it is found that (1 - *p*) + *p*(1 - *p*) + *p*²(1 - *p*) + ... = 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Dividing both sides by (1 - *p*) yields the formula for a geometric series:
1 + *p* + *p*² + *p*³ + ... = 1 / (1 - *p*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>

## Beyond Standard Convergence: Divergent Sums

While the discovery of the geometric series formula arises from values of *p* between 0 and 1, the right-hand side (1 / (1 - *p*)) still makes sense for other values of *p* (except *p* = 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

*   **Case 1: *p* = -1**
    Plugging in *p* = -1, the equation becomes 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + ... = 1/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This alternating sum seems "silly" but is the only possible value in some contexts. The partial sums are 1, 0, 1, 0, and so on, which do not approach a single value in the standard sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

*   **Case 2: *p* = 2**
    Plugging in *p* = 2, the equation reads 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... = -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. This result seems even less reasonable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. The partial sums are 1, 3, 7, 15, 31 (each one less than a power of 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. According to the established definition of infinite sums, these cases should be ignored because the list of partial sums does not approach anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Reinterpreting Divergent Sums: The 2-adic Metric

However, a mathematician might choose to "humor the universe" and explore how 1 + 2 + 4 + ... could indeed approach -1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. This implies that the powers of 2 (2, 4, 8, ...) would have to approach 0 in some sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

This challenge reveals a "sneaky" arbitrary choice in traditional mathematics: the definition of distance between two rational numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. The usual organization of numbers on a line might not be the only valid way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

A notion of distance is a function that takes two numbers and outputs how far apart they are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. To be useful, it should share properties with the familiar distance function, such as "shift invariance" (the distance between two numbers shouldn't change if both are shifted by the same amount, e.g., the distance between 0 and 4 is the same as between 1 and 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Other properties like the triangle inequality are also desirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

### The 2-adic Metric

To make powers of 2 approach zero, a new frame of mind is needed. One might organize numbers into a hierarchy of "rooms," "sub-rooms," and "sub-sub-rooms," and so on, infinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

*   Zero is considered to be in the same "room" as all powers of 2 greater than one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   It's in the same "sub-room" as all powers of 2 greater than two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   And in the same "sub-sub-room" as powers of 2 greater than four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

Shift invariance then dictates where all numbers fall into this hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. For example, negative one must be in smaller and smaller rooms with numbers one less than a power of two, just as zero is in smaller and smaller rooms with the powers of two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

This general idea of closeness based on rooms can be turned into an actual distance function:
*   Numbers in different large "yellow rooms" are a distance of 1 from each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
*   Numbers in the same large room but different "orange sub-rooms" are a distance of 1/2 from each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
*   Numbers in the same orange sub-room but different "sub-sub-rooms" are a distance of 1/4 from each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.
This continues, using reciprocals of larger and larger powers of 2 to indicate closeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

This notion of distance, called the **2-adic metric**, is perfectly legitimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. It is part of a general family of distance functions called **p-adic metrics** (where *p* is any prime number) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. These metrics give rise to entirely new types of numbers, different from real or [[conceptualizing_complex_numbers | complex numbers]], and are central to modern number theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

Using the 2-adic metric, the fact that the sum of all powers of 2 equals negative 1 actually makes sense. The sequence of partial sums (1, 3, 7, 15, 31, and so on) genuinely approaches negative 1 in this new distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

## Math as Invention and Discovery

This journey illustrates a recurring pattern in mathematical discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>:
1.  Nature (or intuition) presents something ill-defined or nonsensical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.
2.  New concepts and definitions are created to make this fuzzy discovery comprehensible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.
3.  These new concepts yield genuinely useful mathematics and broaden traditional notions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

Therefore, the belief is that the "discovery of non-rigorous truths" leads to the "construction of rigorous terms that are useful," perpetuating the cycle of mathematical exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. This process is central to the [[fundamental_concepts_of_calculus | fundamental concepts of calculus]] and other advanced mathematical fields.

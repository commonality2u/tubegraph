Observing the moons of Jupiter proved crucial to one of the most significant discoveries in the [[astronomical_observations_and_their_impact_on_physics | history of physics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Io's Eclipses

The moon [[significance_of_ios_orbital_observations | Io]] regularly goes dark when it enters Jupiter's large shadow during its orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. As it emerges from the shadow, it becomes bright again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. By observing [[significance_of_ios_orbital_observations | Io]] through a telescope night after night, astronomers could mark the precise moment it reappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Initially, these reappearances seemed to occur with clockwork regularity, in 42-hour increments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## The Anomaly in Io's Observations

Despite the initial apparent regularity, it was noticed that the timing of [[significance_of_ios_orbital_observations | Io]]'s reappearances was not perfectly consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. At different times of the year, [[significance_of_ios_orbital_observations | Io]] would appear either ahead of or behind schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Specifically, when Earth was on the same side of the Sun as Jupiter, [[significance_of_ios_orbital_observations | Io]]'s appearance was approximately 20 minutes earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Conversely, when Earth was on the opposite side of the Sun from Jupiter, [[significance_of_ios_orbital_observations | Io]]'s appearance was delayed by about 20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Measuring the Speed of Light

After conducting very precise calculations, Christiaan Huygens realized that this observed delay was due to the finite speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Light was taking 20 minutes to traverse the extra distance between Earth and Jupiter when they were on opposite sides of the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This implied that light traveled a distance equivalent to two [[astronomical_observations_and_their_impact_on_physics | astronomical units]] in approximately 20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

At the time, the true value of the [[astronomical_observations_and_their_impact_on_physics | astronomical unit]] was not accurately known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, leading to initial estimates for the speed of light that might not seem impressive today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. However, this observation was groundbreaking because, for most experiments conducted on Earth at that time, light appeared to travel instantaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This method, using [[astronomical_observations_and_their_impact_on_physics | astronomical observations]], demonstrated that light actually has a measurable speed, which is quite slow on [[astronomical_observations_and_their_impact_on_physics | astronomical scales]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Although imprecise, this clever approach laid the foundation for more accurate experiments to measure the speed of light on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

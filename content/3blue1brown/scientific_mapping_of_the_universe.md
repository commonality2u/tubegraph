Visualizations play a crucial role in understanding the vastness of space. One such animation zooms out by a factor of 10 every three seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This particular animation was created by Paul Dstep as part of a series of videos explaining how scientists determine the [[distance_measurement_in_the_cosmos | distances to various objects in the cosmos]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It effectively illustrates the immense, seemingly empty, orders of magnitude one passes through when departing the solar system before encountering even the first star <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Limitations of Zoom Animations

Despite their effectiveness, [[limitations_of_cosmic_zoom_animations | powers of 10 zoom outs]] can potentially undersell the true scale of the Universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The implied camera position in such animations moves at a speed vastly exceeding the cosmic speed limit, the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This can make distant objects, such as other galaxies, appear almost accessible, when in reality, traveling at the speed of light would still take approximately 2.5 million years to reach the nearest galaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## The Sloan Galactic Survey

Creating a scientifically accurate yet visually compelling end to such a zoom-out presents a challenge, as it requires avoiding artistic renditions of the Universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The solution found was to use a simple point cloud representation of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This data is derived from the [[Galaxies and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey | Sloan Galactic Survey]], which systematically maps the [[distance_measurement_in_the_cosmos | distances to numerous galaxies]] across various directions in the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## The Feat of Cosmic Mapping

The ability to map and study patterns, such as the clusters and strands formed by billions of galaxies in the unfathomable reaches of space, is a testament to the power of science and deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This is mind-boggling given that these galaxies are millions and billions of light-years away and completely beyond our physical grasp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

The "pi vs. tau" debate centers on which circle constant should be considered fundamental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Defining Pi and Tau

*   **Pi (π)**: Traditionally defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, approximately 3.14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This definition links directly to [[pis_relationship_to_circles_and_geometry | circles and geometry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   **Tau (τ)**: Defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its radius, approximately 6.28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

The use of tau was popularized by Michael Hartle's tau manifesto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Another proposed notation, by Robert Palace, suggests a pi symbol with three legs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Arguments for Tau

Proponents of tau argue that many mathematical formulas appear cleaner when using tau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. A key reason is that the number of radians describing a fraction of a circle is simply that fraction of tau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Leonhard Euler's Role in Standardizing Pi

The widespread adoption of pi (3.14) as the standard circle constant can be traced to the influential mathematician Leonhard Euler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Original notes and letters from Euler, accessed by 3b1brown Switzerland correspondent Ben Hambrecht, shed light on his evolving use of the symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Initially, Euler defined pi as the circumference of a circle with radius 1, which corresponds to the 6.28 constant now called tau <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. It is believed he used the Greek letter pi as an abbreviation for "perimeter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

The shift to 3.14 as the common constant occurred through an early calculus book Euler authored in 1748 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. In Chapter 8 of this book, when describing the semi-circumference of a circle with radius 1, Euler explicitly states, "which for the sake of brevity I may write pi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This specific book and section were crucial in spreading the notation across Europe and eventually worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

Interestingly, Euler's use of pi was flexible. He also used the symbol to represent a quarter turn of a circle (what is now known as pi/2 or tau/4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. His approach to the symbol pi was more akin to the modern use of the Greek letter theta: a variable representing an angle that can change based on the problem and context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. While he typically worked with unit circles (radius 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, the 3.14 constant for him represented the ratio of a circle's semi-circumference to its radius, rather than circumference to diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Euler's Mathematical Philosophy

Euler was renowned for his prolific problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. He produced over 500 books and papers during his lifetime, averaging 800 pages of dense mathematics per year, with another 400 publications surfacing posthumously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. His primary focus was on solving the immediate mathematical task, not on debating which constant was universally fundamental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Depending on the problem, a quarter circle constant, a full circle constant, or a half circle constant might have been most natural <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

This flexible approach to conventions, rather than rigid adherence to an "objectively right" standard, seems to correlate with his immense output and transformative insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. In math education, it's suggested that the focus should be on specific problems and puzzles, allowing questions of standards to be answered with respect to a given context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

Three-dimensional (3D) matrix multiplication holds significant importance in fields such as [[applications_of_linear_algebra_in_data_analysis_and_computer_graphics | computer graphics]] and robotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. This is particularly true for describing complex operations like rotations in three dimensions, which can otherwise be challenging to define <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

Instead of directly describing intricate 3D rotations, they can be more easily understood by breaking them down into a composition of separate, simpler rotations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. This decomposition leverages the power of matrix multiplication to represent successive transformations, making complex movements manageable in [[applications_of_linear_algebra_concepts | practical applications]].

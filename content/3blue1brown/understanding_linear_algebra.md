[[linear_transformations_in_linear_algebra | Linear algebra]] is a subject considered required knowledge for nearly any technical discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. However, it is frequently poorly understood by students encountering it for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Challenges in Learning Linear Algebra

[[Challenges students face in learning linear algebra | Students]] often learn how to compute various operations, such as matrix multiplication, the determinant, cross products, or eigenvalues, without grasping the underlying principles or what these concepts truly represent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This often results in students being proficient in the numerical operations of matrices but only vaguely aware of their geometric intuitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Geometric vs. Numeric Understanding
There is a fundamental difference between understanding [[linear_transformations_in_linear_algebra | linear algebra]] on a numeric level and on a geometric level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   [[Geometric versus numeric understanding in linear algebra | Geometric understanding]] allows one to determine which tools to use for specific problems, understand why they work, and interpret results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   [[Geometric versus numeric understanding in linear algebra | Numeric understanding]] is necessary for carrying out the application of those tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

Without a solid foundation in the [[geometric_versus_numeric_understanding_in_linear_algebra | geometric understanding]], problems can go unnoticed until deeper engagement within fields like computer science, engineering, statistics, economics, or mathematics itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. In a class or job that assumes fluency, the application of [[linear_transformations_in_linear_algebra | linear algebra]] by professors or colleagues might seem like "utter magic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, making their quick problem-solving and answer estimation appear as "computational wizardry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Analogy with Trigonometry
Imagine learning the sine function only as an infinite polynomial, which is how calculators evaluate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. If the connection to triangles was vague and not the focus of the course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, then later in a physics course where sines and cosines are readily applied, it would be intimidating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This could make it seem as though only individuals with "computers for brains" are suited for physics, leading to feelings of slowness or inadequacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. The situation is similar with [[linear_transformations_in_linear_algebra | linear algebra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Bridging the Gap: Visual Intuitions

Fortunately, just as with trigonometry, [[visual_understanding_of_linear_transformations | linear algebra]] has a handful of visual intuitions that underlie much of the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The connection between computations and these visual intuitions is typically straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. By understanding the relationship between the geometry and the numbers, the subject's details and practical applications become much more reasonable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

While most professors attempt to convey [[geometric_versus_numeric_understanding_in_linear_algebra | geometric understanding]], many courses may dedicate a disproportionate amount of time to the numerical aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This is despite the fact that computers now handle most numerical computations, leaving humans to focus on the conceptual understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Educational Resources
A series of videos can aim to animate these intuitions, starting from basic vectors and progressing through core topics of [[linear_transformations_in_linear_algebra | linear algebra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Such a series does not aim to replace a full course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, but rather to establish the correct intuitions to make future learning productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. It can also serve as an [[educational_resources_for_teaching_linear_algebra | educational resource]] for instructors teaching courses that presume [[linear_transformations_in_linear_algebra | linear algebra]] fluency, offering a quick brush-up for students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

#### Advice for Learning
When engaging with math videos, it's encouraged to pause and ponder as needed, as the thinking done independently is where true learning occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

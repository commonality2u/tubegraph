[[determinant_properties_and_matrix_multiplication|Matrix multiplication]] has a geometric meaning of applying one transformation after another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. This conceptual framework makes understanding properties of [[determinant_properties_and_matrix_multiplication|matrix multiplication]] much easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>.

## Definition of Associativity
The associative property of [[determinant_properties_and_matrix_multiplication|matrix multiplication]] states that if you have three matrices, A, B, and C, and you multiply them together, it does not matter if you first compute (A × B) and then multiply the result by C, or if you first multiply B × C and then multiply that result by A on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>. In simpler terms, it means it doesn't matter where you place the parentheses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.

## Proof by Visualizing Transformations
While working through a numerical proof of associativity can be "horrible, just horrible, and unenlightening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>, understanding it through the lens of linear transformations makes the property trivial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.

When [[determinant_properties_and_matrix_multiplication|matrix multiplication]] is understood as applying one transformation after another, the associative property implies that if you first apply transformation C, then B, then A, it's the same as applying C, then B, then A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>. There is "nothing to prove" because you are simply applying the same three transformations one after the other, all in the same order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. This perspective provides an honest-to-goodness proof and a clear explanation for why the property holds true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>.

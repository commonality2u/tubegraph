Complex numbers are considered one of the most fundamental pieces of mathematics, holding immense importance in fields such as engineering, pure mathematics, and quantum mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Despite their critical utility, their names—"complex numbers" and "imaginary numbers" (for the components that define them)—are widely regarded as poor choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## The Origin of the Name "Imaginary"

The term "imaginary" was originally coined by René Descartes as a derogatory label, intending to mock the concept and imply that these numbers were not serious mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. However, this dismissive term stuck as a convention, which is now considered "genuinely absurd" given their widespread applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

Alternative names that have been suggested include "sneaky numbers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. A more intuitive renaming could connote concepts like [[Geometric representation of complex numbers | spinning and rotation]], which are key to understanding their utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Defining the Imaginary Unit `i`

The introduction of complex numbers begins with a foundational assumption: the existence of a number, `i`, such that `i^2 = -1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This is a departure from real numbers, where squaring any number (positive or negative) always yields a positive result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, making it impossible to obtain a negative number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

For many, this initial definition can be counterintuitive or even feel like "cheating," akin to defining a problem's solution into existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This discomfort is not uncommon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. However, engineers and serious mathematicians widely regard [[Uses of complex numbers in mathematics and engineering | complex numbers]] as just as "real" and fundamental as real numbers due to their practical utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The ultimate goal is to demonstrate the usefulness of [[Complex numbers in discrete math | imaginary numbers]] and [[complex_numbers_introduction | complex numbers]] to "imbue them with a little more reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

## Geometric Interpretation: The Complex Plane

To give the imaginary unit `i` a "home," the number system is extended from a one-dimensional real number line into a two-dimensional plane, often called the complex plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. In this plane, `i` lives in a "different dimension," perpendicularly to the real number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Specifically, `i` is located one unit perpendicularly above the real number line (if the imaginary axis is vertical) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. This means [[Complex numbers and 2D plane transformations | numbers]] are proposed to be two-dimensional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

This [[geometric_representation_of_complex_numbers | geometric interpretation]] helps explain the seemingly abstract concept of `i` squaring to negative one. Multiplying by `i` corresponds to a 90-degree rotation (counterclockwise) in the complex plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. If multiplying by `i` rotates a number 90 degrees, then multiplying by `i` again (which is `i^2`) would rotate it another 90 degrees, resulting in a total 180-degree rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. A 180-degree rotation of a real number effectively makes it negative (e.g., 1 rotated 180 degrees becomes -1), thus providing a [[geometric_representation_of_complex_numbers | geometric explanation]] for `i^2 = -1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>.

## Basic Operations: Addition and Multiplication

### Addition
Adding [[complex_numbers_introduction | complex numbers]] in the complex plane is straightforward, behaving similarly to vector addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. If you have a complex number `(a + bi)` and another `(c + di)`, their sum is `(a+c) + (b+d)i`. For example, `(4 + i) + (-2 + 2i)` sums to `2 + 3i` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. This operation involves adding the real parts and the imaginary parts separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

### Multiplication
Unlike vectors in 2D, which do not have a natural multiplication operation that yields another 2D vector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>, [[complex_numbers_introduction | complex numbers]] do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. The multiplication rule for complex numbers, when applied to a point like `3 + 2i` multiplied by `i`, results in `-2 + 3i` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. This occurs because `i` distributes to both parts, and `i^2` becomes `-1` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.

Geometrically, multiplying by `i` transforms `(x, y)` to `(-y, x)`, which is precisely a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation of the point in the complex plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. This [[geometric_representation_of_complex_numbers | rotational property of complex number multiplication]] is a core concept that links the algebra of complex numbers to their visual representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.

Complex numbers also behave much like real numbers in terms of algebraic rules, meaning many rules from algebra can carry over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. Their utility extends to providing computational mechanisms for all types of rotations, not just 90-degree increments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. This connection between [[Complex numbers and 2D plane transformations | complex numbers and transformations in the 2D plane]] is fundamental.

## Connection to Trigonometry

One of the interesting applications of complex numbers is their ability to simplify and explain identities in [[connection_between_trigonometry_and_complex_numbers | trigonometry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Formulas like the cosine of the sum of two angles (`cos(A+B)`) can be notoriously hard to remember using traditional [[trigonometry_and_complex_numbers | trigonometric methods]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. However, when approached with complex numbers, these identities not only become less error-prone but also reveal a beautiful underlying meaning, often "falling right out" of the calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. This highlights how complex numbers can make other mathematical concepts more understandable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This relationship foreshadows concepts like [[relationship_between_e_to_the_x_and_complex_numbers | Euler's formula]], which elegantly links exponentials, [[trigonometry_and_complex_numbers | trigonometry]], and [[complex_numbers_introduction | complex numbers]].

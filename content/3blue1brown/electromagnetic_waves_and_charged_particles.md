Light is understood as a wave in the [[maxwells_equations_and_electromagnetic_waves | electromagnetic field]], which can be conceptualized by focusing on the electric field component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The electric field assigns a three-dimensional vector to every point in 3D space, indicating the force that would be applied to a hypothetical unit charge at that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

## Propagation of Influence

A key characteristic of light and electromagnetism is that if a charged particle wiggles up and down, it generates propagating ripples in the electric field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. These ripples travel at speed *c*, often referred to as the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. When these ripples encounter another charged particle, they induce it to wiggle, albeit more weakly, and this secondary wiggle, in turn, creates its own propagations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. The time it takes for an initial acceleration of a charge to influence another charge elsewhere travels at exactly speed *c* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. This speed *c* is better understood as the speed of causality, as it dictates how fast any form of influence travels, with the speed of light being one of its consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

When a charge undergoes sinusoidal oscillation, the resulting rippling effects in the electric field describe the force exerted on another charge located in that field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. For multiple oscillating charges, the total effect on the electric field is simply the sum of the effects from each individual charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. A plane of charges wiggling in sync will produce a concentrated sinusoidal wave in the electric field that propagates perpendicularly to the plane, due to constructive interference, while effects in other directions tend to cancel out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

## Interaction with Materials

When a beam of light enters a material like glass, it causes the charges within the material (such as electrons or ions) to wiggle in response to the light wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. This induced wiggling produces a "second-order" light wave, which has the same frequency as the incoming light and propagates in both perpendicular directions from the layer of charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. The overall electric field observed is the sum of the initial incoming light wave and this second-order wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. The portion of the second-order wave propagating backwards represents the light being reflected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

For the transmitted light, adding the second-order oscillation to the incoming light results in a wave that is almost identical to the incoming light but shifted back in [[wave_behavior_in_materials_and_phase_shift | phase]] by a small amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This [[wave_behavior_in_materials_and_phase_shift | phase]] kick is the fundamental reason why light appears to slow down when passing through a medium, leading to the phenomenon of refraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

### Modeling Charge Oscillations

To understand the interaction, individual charged particles in a material can be modeled as if they are bound to an equilibrium position by a spring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. This is an [[idealized_physics_in_theoretical_simulations | idealized physics]] model where the restoring force is proportional to the displacement (a linear restoring force), which is a good approximation for very small displacements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

When no external force is applied, such a model predicts simple harmonic motion, with the charge oscillating sinusoidally at a natural frequency determined by the "spring constant" (k) and the mass (m) of the particle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. This natural angular frequency, `√(k/m)`, is known as the resonant angular frequency (ωr) of the oscillator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. Increasing *k* (stronger spring) leads to faster oscillation, while increasing *m* (more inertia) leads to slower oscillation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.

When a light beam (an external force) shines on the material, it drives these charges to oscillate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. This external force also oscillates sinusoidally, but with its own distinct angular frequency (ωl), which is the frequency of the light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. After an initial "startup period," the charge settles into a steady sinusoidal motion at the same frequency as the incoming light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>.

The amplitude of this driven oscillation is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. It is proportional to the strength of the incoming light wave and the charge of the particle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>. The amplitude is inversely related to the difference between the square of the resonant frequency (ωr) and the square of the light frequency (ωl) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. If the light frequency is very close to the resonant frequency of the oscillator, the amplitude of the oscillations can grow very large (resonance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>. Conversely, a larger difference between these frequencies leads to a smaller oscillation amplitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>.

### Dependence on Color and Index of Refraction

The amount a material "kicks back" the [[wave_behavior_in_materials_and_phase_shift | phase]] of a light wave depends on the strength of the second-order wave produced by the wiggling charges in the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. This phase kick, in turn, determines the apparent "slowing down" of light and thus the index of refraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. Since the size of the charge's wiggles depends on the frequency (color) of the incoming light (as a consequence of the resonant frequency interaction), the strength of the second-order wave also depends on the light's frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>. Consequently, the amount light slows down is dependent on its frequency, explaining why prisms separate white light into a continuous spectrum of colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.

It is important to note that a more complete model of the charged particle as a harmonic oscillator would include a "drag force" term dependent on the charge's velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>. This term accounts for the absorption of energy from the incoming light wave by the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. Without this term, the model would imply that light always passes through every material without absorption or reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>.

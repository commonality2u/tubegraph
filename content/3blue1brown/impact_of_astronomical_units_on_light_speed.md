The observation of Jupiter's moons proved pivotal in one of the most significant discoveries in the history of physics: determining that light has a finite speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Io's Orbital Anomaly

Jupiter's moon, [[ios_orbit_and_light_speed_discovery | Io]], regularly passes into Jupiter's shadow, emerging bright again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. By observing [[ios_orbit_and_light_speed_discovery | Io]] through a telescope, astronomers could precisely mark the time it reappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. While these reappearances typically occurred in consistent 42-hour increments, a discrepancy was noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. At different times of the year, [[ios_orbit_and_light_speed_discovery | Io]] would appear either ahead of or behind schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

Specifically, when Earth was on the same side of the Sun as Jupiter, [[ios_orbit_and_light_speed_discovery | Io]] appeared about 20 minutes earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Conversely, when Earth was on the opposite side of Jupiter, [[ios_orbit_and_light_speed_discovery | Io]]'s reappearance was delayed by approximately 20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## [[huygens_calculations_on_light_speed | Huygens]]' Insight

Following precise calculations, [[huygens_calculations_on_light_speed | Huygens]] concluded that this 20-minute delay or advancement was due to the time light took to traverse the varying [[distance_measurement_in_the_cosmos | distance]] between Earth and Jupiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. He deduced that light traveled a [[distance_measurement_in_the_cosmos | distance]] equivalent to two astronomical units in roughly 20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Impact of Astronomical Unit Knowledge

At the time of this discovery, the true value of the astronomical unit (the [[distance_measurement_in_the_cosmos | distance]] from the Earth to the Sun) was not precisely known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Consequently, the early estimations for the [[historical_estimations_of_light_speed | speed of light]] based on these observations were not highly accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

Despite the imprecision due to the unrefined knowledge of the astronomical unit, this method was revolutionary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Before this, it was not universally accepted that light had a finite speed, as its propagation appeared instantaneous in most Earth-bound experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. The observation of [[ios_orbit_and_light_speed_discovery | Io]] demonstrated that at [[powers_of_10_scale_in_astronomy | astronomical scales]], light's speed is indeed measurable and finite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This groundbreaking method, though imprecise, laid the essential groundwork for more accurate laboratory experiments on Earth once a rough sense of light's speed had been established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

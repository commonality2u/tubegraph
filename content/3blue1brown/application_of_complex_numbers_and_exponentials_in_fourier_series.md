A [[complex_numbers_and_fourier_transform | complex Fourier series]] is a mathematical tool that uses rotating vectors to draw complex shapes over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Each vector rotates at a constant integer frequency, and their combined "tip to tail" sum draws out a desired shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. By adjusting the initial size and angle of each vector, virtually any shape can be rendered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. While the action of individual arrows is simple rotation, their collective sum exhibits "mind-boggling complexity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Despite this intricacy, the mathematics allows for complete description and control of the swarm's coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The ultimate formula for this process is incredibly short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Fourier Series and the Heat Equation

Historically, [[fourier_series_in_solving_heat_equations | Fourier series]] were developed by Fourier in the context of solving the [[heat_equation_and_its_connection_to_fourier_series | heat equation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This equation describes how temperature distributes on a rod over time and applies to other phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. A simple solution exists if the initial temperature distribution is a cosine wave, which decays exponentially over time, with higher frequencies decaying faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

The [[connection_between_fourier_series_and_differential_equations | heat equation]] is a linear equation, meaning that if two solutions are known, their sum is also a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This linearity is crucial because it allows an infinite family of exponentially decaying cosine waves to be scaled and combined to create a solution for a new, tailor-made initial condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The complexity of the heat distribution's evolution is captured by the different decay rates of these "pure frequency components" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

Fourier's significant insight was to question how an arbitrary function, such as a discontinuous step function (representing two rods at different initial temperatures coming into contact), could be expressed as a sum of sine waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This idea of breaking down functions and patterns into combinations of simple oscillations is now synonymous with Fourier's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### Infinite Sums
While a finite sum of sine waves can only approximate a function (e.g., a flat, discontinuous step function), Fourier considered infinite sums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. An infinite sum is understood as the limit of its partial sums, meaning the sequence of sums approaches a specific value or function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This allows an infinite sum of continuous functions to equal a discontinuous function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. For the heat flow problem, adding infinitely many solutions associated with cosine waves yields an exact solution for the step function's evolution over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

## The Role of Complex Numbers and Exponentials

To compute the coefficients for these series, a more general approach uses [[applications_of_complex_numbers_in_engineering_and_mathematics | complex numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. This expands the output of a function from the real number line to the 2D complex plane, enabling functions to be thought of as "drawings" traced by a pencil tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. This broader view simplifies computations and lays a foundation for concepts like the [[fourier_transforms_and_convolutions_in_integral_computation | Laplace transform]] and the importance of exponential functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

Functions with real number outputs are considered "boring drawings" confined to one dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. In this complex framework, a sine wave corresponds to a pair of [[fourier_series_and_rotating_vectors | rotating vectors]] (e.g., frequencies 1 and -1) that have the same length and are horizontal reflections, with their sum oscillating along the real number line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. This confirms that the real-valued sine wave Fourier series is a special case of the more general complex rotating vector phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

### Complex Exponentials as Building Blocks
The "heart and soul" of [[mathematical_principles_of_fourier_transform | Fourier series]] is the complex exponential, specifically `e^(i*t)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. This function, as time `t` progresses, traces a path around the unit circle at a rate of one unit per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. The connection between [[complex_numbers_and_imaginary_exponents | imaginary exponents]] and circular motion can be intuitively understood through differential equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. While the concept could be described purely with 2D vectors, the inclusion of `i` and `e^x` authentically reflects why this idea is so useful for solving differential equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

Each rotating vector can be described by the formula `e^(n * 2pi * i * t)`, where `n` is an integer representing the frequency (positive for counter-clockwise, negative for clockwise, and `n=0` for a constant vector) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. The initial size and direction of each vector are controlled by multiplying it by a complex constant, `c_n` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. This coefficient determines the initial angle and total magnitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

## Computing the Coefficients

The main challenge in Fourier series is finding these `c_n` coefficients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. For `c_0`, representing the constant term or "center of mass" of the drawing, it can be found by taking the average of the function's outputs over its input range (e.g., from 0 to 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. This average is represented by an integral of `f(t)` from 0 to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. Since other rotating vectors complete whole numbers of rotations, their average value over the interval is zero, leaving only `c_0` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

To find any other coefficient `c_n`, the trick is to multiply the entire function `f(t)` by `e^(-n * 2pi * i * t)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. This action "stills" the `n`-th vector component of `f(t)` because multiplying exponentials adds their exponents, effectively shifting the frequency term by `-n` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. When the average (integral) of this modified function is taken, all other vector components (which now rotate at non-zero integer frequencies) average out to zero, leaving only `c_n` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.

The general formula for `c_n` is:
`c_n = âˆ« f(t) * e^(-n * 2pi * i * t) dt` (integrated over the relevant interval, e.g., 0 to 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.

This expression effectively modifies the 2D drawing to make the `n`-th vector hold still, then averages the result to isolate the still part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. Computers render these animations by treating the path as a complex function, computing this integral numerically for a range of `n` values to find the coefficients `c_n` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. These coefficients then determine the initial angle and magnitude for each little vector, which are set rotating and added tip-to-tail to approximate the original path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>. As the number of vectors approaches infinity, the approximation becomes more accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.

This concept of breaking down functions into combinations of exponentials to solve [[connection_between_fourier_series_and_differential_equations | differential equations]] is a fundamental idea that appears repeatedly in various forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.

Mathematical simulations demonstrate that identifying and isolating infectious individuals, through methods like good testing and quick responsiveness, is "by far most effective" in halting an epidemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. These models represent an [[epidemic_simulations_and_SIR_model | SIR model]] where susceptible individuals become infectious, and then recover or are removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>.

## Isolation in Simulations

In these simulations, a critical threshold of cases triggers an action where infected individuals are sent to a separate location one day after contracting the infection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This represents real-world isolation efforts, and when perfectly implemented, "totally halts the epidemic in its tracks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### Impact of Imperfect Isolation (Asymptomatic Cases)

The effectiveness of isolation is significantly reduced if some infectious cases slip through the process, for example, if individuals show no symptoms and are therefore not tested or isolated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

When 20% of infected individuals go undetected and un-isolated:
*   The peak number of simultaneous cases is only slightly higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   However, the epidemic develops a "very low long tail," taking much longer to stamp out and resulting in about twice as many total cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   In simulations with multiple communities and inter-community travel, a 20% slip-through rate for infectious cases also leads to a much thicker tail and a longer time to track down all cases, with over half the population eventually getting infected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

If 50% of infectious people are *not* isolated, the situation becomes "only barely better than if nothing had been done at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. This highlights that "changes in how many people slip through the tests can cause disproportionately large changes to the total number of people infected" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

### Virulence and Detectability

The most dangerous viruses are often those that can spread undetected while asymptomatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Diseases that quickly kill their hosts or make them severely symptomatic are less dangerous globally, as they are easier to identify and contain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. For instance, the SARS outbreak in 2002 was well-contained because most infectious individuals showed symptoms, making them easier to identify and isolate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

## Comparison to Other Mitigation Strategies

While [[impact_of_social_distancing_and_hygiene_on_disease_spread | social distancing]] is crucial for flattening the curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, and reducing visits to [[role_of_central_locations_in_spreading_disease | central locations]] can help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>, the most effective strategy remains the consistent identification and isolation of cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. Even in simulations with high-risk central locations, effective isolation halts the epidemic without requiring people to avoid each other or stop visiting these spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

## Contact Tracing

In real-world epidemiology, strategies like contact tracing go beyond isolating known cases by also identifying and isolating everyone who has been in contact with those cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

## Conclusion

The simulations highlight the "inordinate value of early widespread testing and the ability to isolate cases" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>. While [[impact_of_social_distancing_and_hygiene_on_disease_spread | social distancing]] is vital when needed and saves lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>, if nothing is in place to contain cases, easing up on restrictions will likely lead to a second wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. The ability to swiftly find and contain novel pathogens through robust testing and isolation prevents potential pandemics from escalating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.

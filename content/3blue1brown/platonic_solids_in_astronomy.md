Johannes Kepler sought to establish an elegant astronomical theory using [[Platonic solids in astronomy | Platonic solids]] to explain planetary orbits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This endeavor formed a significant part of [[Keplers model of the solar system | Kepler's model of the solar system]].

## Kepler's Geometric Model

Kepler's theory proposed a nested arrangement of spheres and [[Platonic solids in astronomy | Platonic solids]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>:
*   A sphere inscribed within an octahedron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.
*   The smallest possible sphere fit around that octahedron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.
*   The smallest possible icosahedron fit around that sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
*   Another sphere layered on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   A dodecahedron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   One more sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   A tetrahedron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   One more sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   A cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   One final sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

This specific arrangement resulted in six spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Kepler believed that the ratios between the sizes of these six spheres would correspond to the orbital ratios of the six known planets at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The use of [[Platonic solids in astronomy | Platonic solids]] in this model gave it a perceived natural or universal quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Validation and Impact

Kepler acquired orbital data to test his theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. However, the theory consistently failed to fit the observed data, being off by a few percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Despite starting with an incorrect premise, this effort was crucial for [[Keplers contributions to astronomy | Kepler's contributions to astronomy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. It led him to become the first person to accurately understand how planets orbit the Sun and to formulate his renowned laws of planetary motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

This article explores three "fake proofs" that highlight the importance of rigor, critical thinking, and understanding the nuances of [[Limits in calculus | limiting arguments]] in mathematics. Each example demonstrates a common pitfall in mathematical reasoning, particularly when relying solely on visual intuition.

## Fake Proof 1: Surface Area of a Sphere is π²R²

This proof attempts to derive the surface area of a sphere through a geometric transformation, yielding an incorrect result.

### The Method
The method involves subdividing a sphere into vertical slices, similar to how an orange is chopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. These "wedge slices" from both the northern and southern hemispheres are then unraveled and interlaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

The base of this combined shape originates from the sphere's circumference (an unraveled equator), giving it a length of 2πR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The height of each wedge is a quarter of a walk around the sphere, resulting in a length of πR/2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

The idea is that as the sphere is divided into finer and finer slices, this unraveled shape approaches a perfect rectangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The area of this hypothetical rectangle would be (πR/2) × (2πR) = π²R² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### The Problem
The true surface area of a sphere is 4πR² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. If the proof were correct, it would imply that π = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

The fundamental flaw lies in how the wedges are flattened. When a spherical wedge is accurately flattened in a way that preserves its area, it does not look like a triangle; it bulges outward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. This is because the width of a wedge varies non-linearly (according to a sine curve) as one moves from its apex to its base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

When the northern and southern hemisphere wedges are interlaced, this non-linear variation leads to a meaningful amount of overlap between the edges, which persists even with finer subdivisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. This overlap accounts for the discrepancy between the false π²R² and the true 4πR² <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

This issue highlights a key concept in geometry: [[Convexity in mathematical geometry | Gaussian curvature]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. You cannot flatten a curved surface without losing geometric information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. [[Limits in calculus | Limiting arguments]] that flatten pieces of a sphere only work if the pieces become smaller in *both* directions, allowing the surface to appear locally flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. The orange wedge argument failed because the pieces only got thin in one direction, maintaining their curvature in the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

This phenomenon is akin to [[Visualizing integration and approximations | rearrangement puzzles]] where area seems to appear or disappear due to subtle, unnoticed bulges or dents in the rearranged shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

## Fake Proof 2: Pi Equals 4

This classic argument attempts to show that π = 4 by approximating a circle's circumference.

### The Method
Starting with a circle (e.g., radius 1), its circumference is approximated by a sequence of curves. The first curve is a square whose sides are tangent to the circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The perimeter of this square is 8 (for a circle with radius 1, diameter 2, so circumference 2π, and perimeter 8).

Subsequent curves are generated by folding in the corners of the previous shape so they just touch the circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. In each fold, the path taken (e.g., up then left) is replaced by an equivalent path (left then up), so no length is lost or gained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Therefore, every curve in the sequence has a perimeter of 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

The argument claims that the [[Limits in calculus | limit]] of these approximations equals the circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. By defining each curve as a parametric function `c_n(t)` and taking the limit `c_infinity(t) = lim(n->infinity) c_n(t)`, this limiting function `c_infinity` genuinely traces out the smooth circular curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Since each approximation has a length of 8, the [[Limits in calculus | limit]] of their lengths is also 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. This leads to the conclusion that the circle's circumference is 8, implying π = 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### The Problem
While the [[Continuity and function limits in mathematical curves | limit of the curves]] *is* the circle, and the [[Limits in calculus | limit of the lengths]] of the approximations *is* 8, the critical error is the assumption that the limit of the lengths of the curves is the same as the length of the limit of the curves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This example serves as a counter-example to show why this is not always the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. The jagged approximations never truly become smooth, even in the limit, in terms of their length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

This example highlights the care required when applying [[Limits in calculus | limiting arguments]] in calculus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. For instance, in [[Application of limits in integral calculus | integral calculus]], calculating the area under a curve involves approximating it with rectangles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. The hope is that as the rectangles become thinner, the sum of their areas approaches the true area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. To make this rigorous, one must explicitly define the error between the approximations and the true value, and demonstrate that this error approaches zero in the limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. This is known as the [[Concept of sample approximation in integration | Riemann sum]] definition of the definite integral.

## Fake Proof 3: All Triangles Are Isosceles

This proof is presented in a traditional Euclidean style, relying on geometric constructions and congruence relations.

### The Method
For any triangle ABC, the proof attempts to show that side AB must equal side AC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
1.  Draw the perpendicular bisector of side BC. Let D be the midpoint of BC, and the bisector passes through D at 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
2.  Draw the angle bisector of angle A. Let P be the intersection of this bisector with the perpendicular bisector of BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
3.  Draw a line from P perpendicular to AC, intersecting at E <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
4.  Draw a line from P perpendicular to AB, intersecting at F <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

The proof then uses standard congruence relations:
*   Triangle AFP is congruent to triangle AEP (Angle-Side-Angle congruence: share AP, angle alpha, 90-degree angle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This implies AF = AE and PF = PE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   Triangle BDP is congruent to triangle CDP (Side-Angle-Side congruence: BD = CD, 90-degree angle, share PD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This implies BP = CP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   Triangle BFP is congruent to triangle CEP (Side-Side-Angle congruence: BF = CE, BP = CP, 90-degree angle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. This implies FB = EC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

Finally, by adding lengths: AB = AF + FB and AC = AE + EC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Since AF = AE and FB = EC, it follows that AB = AC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This would imply all triangles are isosceles, or even equilateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

### The Problem
The proof is logically sound in its congruence statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. The subtle flaw lies in a hidden assumption about the geometry of the triangle: the point P (intersection of the bisectors) can sit outside the triangle, and consequently, the point E (perpendicular projection from P to AC) may not lie *between* A and C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.

The final step, stating that AC = AE + EC, is only valid if E is located *between* A and C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. For many triangles, point E (or F) will fall outside the segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. If E is not between A and C, then AC might be |AE - EC| or a different combination, invalidating the conclusion. This demonstrates the critical need to verify the positions of points within geometric constructions.

## Conclusion

These three examples underscore that while visual intuition and diagrams can be invaluable for understanding, they can also be misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. Mathematics requires rigorous proofs, where every step is justified and hidden assumptions and edge cases are meticulously checked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. Without this rigor, even seemingly straightforward arguments can lead to false conclusions.

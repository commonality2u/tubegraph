## Kepler's Initial Theory
[[keplers_contributions_to_astronomy | Kepler]] initially aimed to prove an "elegant theory" concerning planetary orbits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This theory involved a sequence of nested Platonic solids and spheres: imagining a sphere inscribed in an octahedron, then fitting the smallest possible sphere around it, followed by an icosahedron, another sphere, a dodecahedron, another sphere, a tetrahedron, another sphere, a cube, and finally one more sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. [[keplers_contributions_to_astronomy | Kepler]] believed that the ratios between the sizes of these six resulting spheres would correspond to the orbital ratios of the six known planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. He felt this arrangement represented a "natural or Universal set of ratios" because it was based on Platonic solids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Data Acquisition and Analysis
To validate his theory, [[keplers_contributions_to_astronomy | Kepler]] acquired orbital data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The method he employed for this analysis was characterized as "completely heroic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Discrepancies and Breakthrough
Despite his efforts, [[keplers_contributions_to_astronomy | Kepler]] discovered that his initial theory did not align with the acquired data, consistently being "off by a few percent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Although he began with an incorrect premise, this rigorous process of attempting to fit his theory to observed data ultimately led him to be the first person to comprehend the actual motion of planets around the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This work was fundamental to the [[development_of_keplers_laws_of_planetary_motion | development of his famous astronomical laws]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

The concept of measuring cosmic distances often begins with understanding the size and shape of Earth itself, and then extending that knowledge to celestial bodies like the Moon and Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. An idea of "pure genius" in astronomy, as described by Einstein, involves using clever mathematical tricks to deduce these distances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

## Earth's Spherical Shape and Lunar Eclipses

To even ask about Earth's radius, one must first assume the Earth is a sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. The first truly convincing evidence for Earth's spherical shape came from observing the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

This follows a constant theme in [[measuring_cosmic_distances_using_the_distance_ladder | the distance ladder]]: to measure one object (e.g., Earth), you need a reference object a certain distance away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. Since humans are "stuck" on Earth, viewing it from multiple angles to discern its roundness is impossible without leaving the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. However, there's a geometric argument: if a convex body's every projection is a circle, then it must be a sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. While this isn't true in two dimensions (where shapes like Reuleaux polygons have constant-length projections that aren't round) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>, it holds true in three dimensions due to sufficient perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

Aristotle, without modern technology like telescopes or spacecraft, was able to deduce Earth's shape by observing lunar eclipses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Lunar eclipses occur when the Moon passes through Earth's shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. Crucially, the Earth's shadow is always a circular arc, visibly demonstrating the planet's roundness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

## Calculating Earth-Moon Distance

Once the Earth's size could be estimated, such as through [[eratosthenes_calculation_of_earths_circumference | Eratosthenes' calculation of Earth's circumference]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>, the next step was to deduce the distance to the Moon using eclipses again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>.

During a lunar eclipse, Earth's shadow is approximately twice the radius of Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>. Ancient astronomers observed that lunar eclipses typically last no longer than four hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. They also knew that the Moon takes roughly one lunar month (around 28 days) to complete its orbit around Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>. By comparing the duration of the eclipse to the orbital period of the Moon, they could work out the relationship between the distance to the Moon and the radius of the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>.

More precisely, the time it takes for the Moon to traverse one Earth diameter in space could be approximated by the duration between the first moment the Moon enters the shadow and the first moment it begins to exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>. The measurements would have been based on the longest known eclipses, with a more accurate duration being closer to three and a half hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.

Aristarchus famously performed this calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. He estimated that the distance to the Moon was approximately 60 Earth radii <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>. This estimate was remarkably accurate, given that the Moon's elliptical orbit actually varies between about 58 and 62 Earth radii <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

## Estimating the Moon's Size

Beyond distance, lunar eclipses also offer a visible means to estimate the relative size of the Earth and the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. The Moon is about a quarter as wide as the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>.

Another method used by the Greeks to deduce the Moon's size involved observing how long it takes for the full Moon to rise, which is roughly two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>. This phenomenon is primarily due to Earth's rotation, causing the observer's line of sight to scan across the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. Since the Moon appears to cycle around Earth approximately every 24 hours (due to Earth's rotation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>, the ratio of two minutes to 24 hours provides the ratio between the Moon's radius and its distance from Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>. Knowing the distance to the Moon from the eclipse method then allowed them to calculate its radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.

Although these ancient estimates were only approximately true due to the Moon's elliptical orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>, they provided remarkably decent estimates for the Moon's size and distance with almost no technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>.

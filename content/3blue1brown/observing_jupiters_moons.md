Observing the moons of Jupiter proved instrumental in one of the most significant discoveries in the history of physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## The Peculiar Orbit of Io

Specifically, the moon [[ios_orbit_and_light_speed_discovery | Io]] goes dark when it enters Jupiter's shadow and becomes bright again as it emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. By continuously observing [[ios_orbit_and_light_speed_discovery | Io]] through a telescope, astronomers could mark the exact time it reappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Initially, these reappearances seemed to occur in precise 42-hour increments, like clockwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

However, it was not entirely consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. At different times of the year, [[ios_orbit_and_light_speed_discovery | Io]]'s reappearance was either ahead or behind schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. When Earth was on the same side of the Sun as Jupiter, [[ios_orbit_and_light_speed_discovery | Io]]'s emergence was about 20 minutes earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Conversely, when Earth was on the opposite side of Jupiter, it took 20 minutes longer for [[ios_orbit_and_light_speed_discovery | Io]] to reappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This constituted a measurable delay in the observed orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## The Discovery of Light's Finite Speed

After precise calculations, Christiaan Huygens realized the explanation for this discrepancy: [[ios_orbit_and_light_speed_discovery | light]] itself was taking approximately 20 minutes to travel the extra distance across Earth's orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This meant that two astronomical units (the diameter of Earth's orbit) were traversed by [[ios_orbit_and_light_speed_discovery | light]] in about 20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Significance of the Discovery

At the time, the true astronomical unit was not precisely known, so the initial estimates for the [[ios_orbit_and_light_speed_discovery | speed of light]] might not appear impressive today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. More importantly, it was not even widely accepted that [[ios_orbit_and_light_speed_discovery | light]] had a finite speed; on Earth, it seemed to travel instantaneously in most experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. However, at astronomical scales, [[ios_orbit_and_light_speed_discovery | light]]'s speed proved to be "really slow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This ingenious method of measuring [[ios_orbit_and_light_speed_discovery | light]]'s speed by observing [[ios_orbit_and_light_speed_discovery | Io]], despite its initial imprecision, established a crucial foundation for more accurate experiments conducted on Earth later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

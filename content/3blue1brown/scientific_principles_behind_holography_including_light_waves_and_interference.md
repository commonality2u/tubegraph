A hologram is a special kind of recording on film that creates the illusion of looking through a window into a recorded three-dimensional scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This phenomenon can feel "magical" because a 3D scene appears behind a piece of glass, allowing a viewer to move their head and see light play off objects in different ways, despite there being only an empty table and a diverging laser beam shining on the glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The single piece of film inside the glass records the entire three-dimensional scene through a special exposure method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

This [[basic_concept_of_holograms_and_its_magical_appearance | illusion]] is surreal, as all visual cues suggest something is truly there, even when nothing is behind the glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Holograms can even record magnified scenes, like a microchip viewed through a microscope, giving the illusion of a 3D object stored on a 2D film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

The incredible aspect of holography lies in the vast amount of information stored on the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Unlike an ordinary photograph that records a scene from a single viewing angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, a hologram provides a continuous range of differing perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Every optical detail from all possible viewing angles is stored on a two-dimensional piece of film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Historical Context
The principle behind holography was discovered by Dennis Gabor in 1947 while he was working on electron microscopy methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. His fundamental insight reportedly came to him while watching a tennis match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. However, holography only became practical decades later with the invention of lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Gabor received the Nobel Prize for his discovery in 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Types of Holograms
There are different types of holograms:
*   **[[detailed_explanation_of_transmission_and_reflection_holograms | Transmission Hologram]]**: This is the simplest version, where the scene is only visible when illuminated with a laser from behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **[[detailed_explanation_of_transmission_and_reflection_holograms | White Light Reflection Hologram]]**: A more advanced variant that can be illuminated using ordinary light reflecting off of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The microscope example shown in the video is a reflection hologram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Recording a Hologram: The Role of Phase

Ordinary photography records a scene from a single viewing angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. In a pinhole camera, light passes through a tiny hole, exposing the film such that each part of the film only "sees" one narrow region of the scene, thereby limiting exposure to a single viewing angle and losing information from all other angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

The goal of a hologram is to recreate the entire light field around a scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This light field is a complex electromagnetic field surrounding objects, with specifics depending on every optical property of the objects and their illumination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. An observer's view depends on their position within this field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Recreating this full field, even without the original objects, creates the desired illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

To record the entire light field, the film must not be limited by a pinhole or lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Exposing film without these would create a blurred mess, but the key is to account for a piece of information about light that normal photography loses: **phase** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### Understanding Light Waves and Phase
Light can be thought of as an oscillating sine wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Amplitude**: The height of this wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Phase**: How far along the wave is in its cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

Only the amplitude of the wave determines how much film gets exposed, based on the average intensity (proportional to the square of the amplitude) over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. If a wave shifts by half its wavelength, it makes no difference to the film's exposure; the film "forgets" the light's phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

To record the phase of light, not just its amplitude, a second beam of light with the same frequency, called the **reference wave**, is shined onto the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   If the first beam (from the object) is *in sync* with the reference wave, they **constructively interfere**, producing a wave with twice the amplitude and strongly exposing the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   If the first beam is *shifted back half a cycle*, they **destructively interfere**, canceling each other out and exposing the film much less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

This interference makes the exposure highly sensitive to phase shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This insight requires all light to have the same frequency, necessitating the use of a **laser** instead of ordinary white light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

### The Holographic Setup
A laser beam is passed through a **beam splitter** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>:
1.  One half (the **object wave**) is spread out, bounces off the scene, and hits the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
2.  The other half (the **reference wave**) is also spread out but does not interact with the scene before hitting the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

These two waves interfere at the film's plane, creating an exposure pattern that is heavily dependent on the phase of the object wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. This pattern looks nothing like the original objects, appearing as a chaotic mess of rapidly oscillating fringes (points of high and low exposure) under a microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

> [!info] Sensitivity to Movement
> The exposure pattern is incredibly sensitive to even tiny movements of objects in the scene during recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. A shift comparable to the wavelength of light (a few hundred nanometers) can completely alter the pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. This is why a meditative stillness is required during the exposure, which can take minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## Reconstruction: The Magic of Diffraction

The mystery of holography is how shining *only* the reference wave through the exposed film (after removing the objects and blocking the object beam) perfectly recreates the object wave, giving the illusion that the scene is still there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. A small piece of a hologram can still show essentially every part of the recorded scene when viewed through it, though not all at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

### Simplest Case: Hologram of a Single Point
Consider recording a hologram of the simplest object: a single point floating in 3D space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   The object wave is a radial wave propagating away from this point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
*   The reference wave is modeled as a plane wave coming in perpendicular to the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. (In practice, the reference beam comes in at an angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>).

The exposure pattern on the film results from the interference between these two waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. If the light from the object hitting the nearest point of the film is in phase with the reference beam, that center point is strongly exposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. For points farther from the center, as the distance to the object increases, the phase of the object wave cycles in and out of phase with the reference wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. This creates a pattern of **concentric rings** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>, where the exposure oscillates between high and low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. This pattern is known as a **Fresnel zone plate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

The distance between these fringes gets smaller farther from the center, approaching the wavelength of light itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. The inner rings get smaller when the object point is closer, and larger when it's farther away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. This pattern encodes the 3D coordinates of the point: the center of the rings gives the x-y coordinates, and the ring spacing uniquely determines the z-coordinate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

### Diffraction Gratings and Reconstruction
When the reference wave shines through this Fresnel zone plate pattern, it acts like a [[geometric_analysis_of_light_projection | diffraction grating]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

> [!info] Mini-Lesson: Diffraction Gratings
> A [[geometric_analysis_of_light_projection | diffraction grating]] is a wall with many thin, evenly spaced slits that light can pass through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. Each slit can be modeled as a single point emanating light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. When light passes through multiple slits, the waves interfere, creating patterns of bright and dark spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. This phenomenon, famously demonstrated by Thomas Young in 1801 with two slits, was early confirmation of light's wave nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.
>
> When a light wave shines through many slits, the pattern emerges: one beam shines down the middle (zeroth order beam), and other distinct beams shine off on either side (first order, second order, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. The angle (theta) of these diffracted beams is determined by the spacing between the slits (d) and the wavelength of the light (lambda) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.
>
> The key equation is: **d * sin(theta) = lambda** (or an integer multiple of lambda) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>.
> *   When `d * sin(theta)` equals a whole wavelength, all beams from different slits are in phase, leading to constructive interference and a distinct beam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.
> *   A narrower grating spacing (smaller d) results in a bigger angle (theta) for the diffracted beams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.
> *   This equation also explains why white light through a diffraction grating separates into distinct wavelengths, like a rainbow, seen in phenomena such as reflections off DVDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.

For a Fresnel zone plate, the spacing between fringes (D) multiplied by the sine of the angle (theta prime) between a line from the film to the object and the perpendicular to the film, exactly equals the wavelength of light: **D * sin(theta prime) = lambda** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>.

When the reference wave shines through the Fresnel zone plate, near any given point on the film, it acts like a [[geometric_analysis_of_light_projection | diffraction grating]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>. One of the resulting first-order diffracted beams exactly matches the angle of the line connecting that point on the film to where the object was during recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.

This implies that for an observer on the other side of the film, every point on the film emits multiple beams, but one of these beams at each point mimics what a beam from the original object would look like if it were still present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>. As the observer moves their head, the apparent bright spot on the glass moves with them, creating the illusion of a floating point of light behind the glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>.

### Holographic Artifacts: Zeroth Order and Conjugate Image
*   **Zeroth Order Beam**: This beam is essentially a rescaled version of the reference wave and appears as a bright glow from everywhere behind the film, which can be distracting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>. It can be mitigated by shining the reference beam in at an angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>.
*   **Conjugate Image**: This is another first-order beam. If lines are drawn along this beam from every point on the film, they converge at a single point on the opposite side of the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>. More generally, it appears as a reflected and often bizarrely warped version of the original scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>. In the earliest days of holography, this conjugate image muddied observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>, but using an angled reference beam allows for a clean separation of the reconstructed object wave from this artifact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>.

When the exposure pattern is not a binary grating (where light is completely blocked or passed), but instead follows a sine wave pattern of opacity, higher-order beams are not produced; only zeroth and first-order beams result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>.

### Generalizing to Complex Scenes
While the single-point explanation is useful for intuition, a complex scene can be thought of as a continuous cloud of many little points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>. The resulting exposure pattern, although effectively looking like random noise for many points, still encodes the 3D position and orientation of the object, enabling reconstruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.

### The Importance of Film Resolution
For holography to work, the film must have extremely high resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>. Standard Polaroid film resolves about 10 lines per millimeter, and microfilm about 100 lines per millimeter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>. Holographic film, however, can resolve many thousands of lines per millimeter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:48">[00:33:48]</a>. This high resolution is necessary because the spacing between fringes in a zone plate becomes very narrow, and faithfully recording these variations is crucial for reconstructing the object beam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>. Without recording the outer fringes, a viewer would not see the object from sharp angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>.

The point-based explanation has limitations; for instance, it doesn't fully explain how objects like a glass Klein bottle, which refract and distort light, are perfectly recreated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>. This requires a more abstract framework.

## Broader Significance and Applications
Beyond art, holograms have significant practical applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>. They are relevant to **interferometry**, a technique that uses wave interference to measure extremely tiny distances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>. By superimposing an object with its own hologram, minute shifts in position become visible as dark stripes due to interference, allowing for precise measurement of these shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. The ability to record and reproduce an entire wavefront is a useful tool for various experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>.

While the discussion primarily covers [[detailed_explanation_of_transmission_and_reflection_holograms | transmission holograms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>, advanced techniques exist, such as [[detailed_explanation_of_transmission_and_reflection_holograms | white light reflection holograms]], where variations in film thickness are relevant for filtering wavelengths during reconstruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>. Holography can also make changes in a scene over time visible from different angles, and convert 3D computer graphics models into holograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>.

## Formal Explanation Using Complex Numbers

A more formal and powerful way to explain holograms involves using complex numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:29">[00:38:29]</a>.

> [!abstract] Algebraic Derivation
> Let `R` be the reference wave and `O` be the object wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.
>
> 1.  **Recording**: The combined wave shining on the film is `R + O` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>. The exposure pattern (opacity) is proportional to the square of the amplitude, which can be represented as the magnitude squared of the complex sum `|R + O|^2` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a>. Using complex numbers, `|X|^2 = X * X*` (where `X*` is the complex conjugate of X) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>. So, the exposure is proportional to `(R + O) * (R* + O*)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:58">[00:41:58]</a>.
>
> 2.  **Reconstruction**: When only the reference wave `R` shines through the exposed film, the wave immediately on the other side can be written as `R * (1 - opacity)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. Substituting the exposure expression (as opacity), the resulting wave is proportional to `R * (R + O) * (R* + O*)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>.
>
> 3.  **Expansion and Interpretation**: Expanding `R * (R + O) * (R* + O*)` yields terms like:
>     *   `R * (R*R + R*O + OR* + OO*)` (distributing R)
>     *   `R*R*R + R*R*O + OR*R* + OO*R*` (further expansion)
>     Simplifying the expression and recognizing `X*X` as a real scaling factor, the terms generally correspond to:
>     *   ` (R*R) * R` (or `|R|^2 * R`): A scaled copy of the reference wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:35">[00:42:35]</a>. This corresponds to the **zeroth order beam** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>.
>     *   ` (R*R) * O` (or `|R|^2 * O`): A scaled copy of the object wave itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:42:55]</a>. This is the **reconstructed object wave** we aim for, corresponding to one of the **first order beams** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>.
>     *   ` (O*R) * R` (or `O*|R|^2` - a complex conjugate version of O scaled by a real number ): A term involving the complex conjugate of the object wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>. This corresponds to the **conjugate image** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>.
>
> This algebraic breakdown demonstrates why a copy of the object wave appears on the other side of the film, regardless of the object wave's complexity or the reference wave's simplicity, as long as the reference wave can be reproduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>. This abstract framework offers reassurance that the limitations of the simpler explanations are surmountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>. The fact that a 3D scene can be stored on 2D film relies on light obeying laws regular enough that the state of a light wave in 3D space is sufficiently constrained by its value on a 2D boundary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.

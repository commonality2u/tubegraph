[[understanding_the_basics_of_bitcoin_and_cryptocurrency | Bitcoin]] is a fully digital currency designed to operate without government issuance or bank management of accounts and transactions, and its inventor remains unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The fundamental nature of [[understanding_the_basics_of_bitcoin_and_cryptocurrency | Bitcoin]] and other cryptocurrencies lies in a clever system of decentralized, trustless verification, underpinned by mathematical concepts from cryptography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Building a Trustless System: From Ledger to Currency

To understand the core of [[understanding_the_basics_of_bitcoin_and_cryptocurrency | Bitcoin]], one can imagine creating a communal ledger to track payments among friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This public ledger, accessible to everyone, would initially operate on an honor system where individuals add new lines and settle up at the end of each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. However, this system faces a significant trust issue: how to prevent unauthorized entries, such as Bob falsely recording "Alice pays Bob $100" without Alice's approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Digital Signatures: Ensuring Authenticity

The first cryptographic element introduced to solve this trust problem is [[digital_signatures_and_256_bit_security | digital signatures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Like handwritten signatures, a [[digital_signatures_and_256_bit_security | digital signature]] allows a sender to prove they approved a transaction, making it infeasible for others to forge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

The mechanism involves each participant generating a public key-private key pair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>:
*   **Private Key (SK):** A secret string of bits kept by the owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **Public Key (PK):** A publicly shared string of bits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

A [[digital_signatures_and_256_bit_security | digital signature]] differs from a handwritten one because it changes for different messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. It is a string of 1s and 0s, commonly 256 bits long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Even a slight alteration to the message completely changes the resulting signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

Formally, producing a signature involves a function that depends on both the message and the sender's private key, ensuring only the owner can create it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. A separate verification function, using the public key, outputs true or false to confirm the signature's validity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

#### Security through [[256_bit_security_and_its_implications | 256-Bit Security]]

The security of [[digital_signatures_and_256_bit_security | digital signatures]] relies on the infeasibility of finding a valid signature without the secret key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. The only known strategy is to guess and check random signatures, which can be verified using the public key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

The number of possible signatures with a length of [[256_bit_security_and_its_implications | 256 bits]] is 2 to the power of 256, an astronomically large number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This vast number ensures that when a signature is verified, there is extreme confidence that it could only have been produced by someone with access to the associated secret key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

#### Preventing Duplication: Unique Transaction IDs

While [[digital_signatures_and_256_bit_security | digital signatures]] prevent forgery, a signed transaction could theoretically be copied multiple times by the recipient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. To counter this, each signed transaction must include a unique identifier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This means every time Alice pays Bob, even the same amount, a completely new signature is required for each entry on the ledger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### From Honor System to Independent Currency

Initially, the ledger still relied on settling debts with physical cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. To eliminate this reliance, a system was devised where participants pre-fund their accounts on the ledger, and transactions are only accepted if the sender has sufficient funds recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Verifying a transaction thus requires knowing the full history of transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

This crucial step separates the ledger from physical currency, allowing "ledger dollars" to function as an independent digital currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. The history of transactions effectively *is* the currency itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

## Cryptographic Hash Functions and Proof of Work: Achieving Decentralized Consensus

In a truly decentralized system like [[understanding_the_basics_of_bitcoin_and_cryptocurrency | Bitcoin]], where everyone keeps their own copy of the ledger and transactions are broadcast publicly, a central challenge arises: how can everyone agree on the correct ledger and transaction order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>?

The solution offered by the original [[understanding_the_basics_of_bitcoin_and_cryptocurrency | Bitcoin]] paper is to trust the ledger that has the most computational work put into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. This involves [[cryptographic_hash_functions_with_256_bit_security | cryptographic hash functions]] to make fraudulent transactions or conflicting ledgers computationally infeasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

### What is a [[cryptographic_hash_functions_with_256_bit_security | Cryptographic Hash Function]]?

A [[cryptographic_hash_functions_with_256_bit_security | hash function]] takes any message or file as input and produces a fixed-length string of bits, like 256 bits, as output (called a hash or digest) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. For a [[cryptographic_hash_functions_with_256_bit_security | cryptographic hash function]] like SHA256, the output appears random, and even a slight change in the input completely alters the hash in an unpredictable way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

A key property of a [[cryptographic_hash_functions_with_256_bit_security | cryptographic hash function]] is its infeasibility to compute in reverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. Given a hash output, there's no better method than guessing and checking to find the input that produced it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Although there's no rigorous mathematical proof for this, modern security, including secure browser connections and banking, heavily relies on this property of [[cryptographic_hash_functions_with_256_bit_security | cryptographic hash functions]] like SHA256 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

### Proof of Work: Verifying Computational Effort

A [[blockchain_and_proof_of_work_in_the_bitcoin_protocol | proof of work]] demonstrates that significant computational effort has been expended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. For example, if someone presents a list of transactions and a "special number" such that the SHA256 hash of the list combined with that number starts with 30 zeros, it indicates they likely performed about a billion guesses to find that number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. Crucially, verifying this work is quick, simply by running the hash, without having to replicate the effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

This work is inherently tied to the data: changing even one transaction in the list would completely alter the hash, requiring a new [[blockchain_and_proof_of_work_in_the_bitcoin_protocol | proof of work]] (i.e., another billion guesses) to validate the modified list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

## Blockchain and Consensus

In [[understanding_the_basics_of_bitcoin_and_cryptocurrency | Bitcoin]], the ledger is organized into "blocks," each containing a list of transactions and its own [[blockchain_and_proof_of_work_in_the_bitcoin_protocol | proof of work]] (a special number making the block's hash start with many zeros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. For ordering, each block must include the hash of the previous block in its header, creating a "blockchain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. This chaining means altering any past block requires redoing all the work for subsequent blocks in the chain, making tampering extremely difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

"Block creators" (miners) listen for transactions, collect them into a block, and perform the work to find the special number for its hash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. They are rewarded with new "ledger dollars" (the "block reward") for successfully creating and broadcasting a valid block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>. This [[bitcoin_mining_and_block_creation | mining]] process introduces new currency into the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.

The core of decentralized consensus in [[understanding_the_basics_of_bitcoin_and_cryptocurrency | Bitcoin]] is that participants always defer to the longest [[blockchain_and_proof_of_work_in_the_bitcoin_protocol | blockchain]]—the one with the most work invested in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. This makes it incredibly difficult to defraud the system. For Alice to fool Bob with a fraudulent block, she would need to continuously out-compute all other miners to maintain a longer chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>. Unless she controls nearly 50% of the total computing resources, the legitimate chain will inevitably grow faster, leading Bob to reject her fraudulent one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>. Therefore, trust in a transaction is established only after several new blocks have been added on top of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>.

This system of decentralized consensus, built on [[blockchain_and_proof_of_work_in_the_bitcoin_protocol | proof of work]] and [[cryptographic_hash_functions_with_256_bit_security | cryptographic hash functions]], forms the fundamental backbone of the [[understanding_the_basics_of_bitcoin_and_cryptocurrency | Bitcoin protocol]] and many other cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. The difficulty of the [[blockchain_and_proof_of_work_in_the_bitcoin_protocol | proof of work]] is automatically adjusted to ensure a new block is found, on average, every 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. While block rewards decrease over time, [[transaction_fees_and_scalability_issues_in_bitcoin | transaction fees]] incentivize [[bitcoin_mining_and_block_creation | miners]] to include payments in new blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.

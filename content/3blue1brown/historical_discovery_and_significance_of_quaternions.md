[[mathematical_properties_and_noncommutative_nature_of_quaternions | Quaternions]] are a captivating and often underappreciated number system in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. While [[complex_numbers_in_mathematics | complex numbers]] represent a two-dimensional extension of real numbers, [[mathematical_properties_and_noncommutative_nature_of_quaternions | quaternions]] are a four-dimensional extension of [[complex_numbers_in_mathematics | complex numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Beyond their abstract mathematical properties, they possess significant practical utility for describing [[applications_of_quaternions_in_3d_rotations_and_quantum_mechanics | rotations in three dimensions]] and even play a role in [[applications_of_quaternions_in_3d_rotations_and_quantum_mechanics | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## The Discovery by William Rowan Hamilton

The story of their discovery is well-known in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton dedicated much of his life to finding a three-dimensional number system analogous to the [[complex_numbers_in_mathematics | complex numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. His son would routinely inquire if he had figured out how to divide "triples," to which Hamilton consistently replied, "not yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

On October 16, 1843, while crossing the Broom Bridge in Dublin, Hamilton experienced a flash of insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. He realized that what was needed was not just one additional dimension to the [[complex_numbers_in_mathematics | complex numbers]], but two more imaginary dimensions, totaling three imaginary dimensions to describe space, with real numbers existing perpendicularly in a fourth dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. He famously carved the crucial equation describing these three imaginary units into the bridge, which is now commemorated with a plaque <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

At the time of Hamilton's discovery, the modern concept of vectors, including the dot product and cross product, did not exist in a standardized form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Initial Reception and Controversy

Following his breakthrough, Hamilton strongly advocated for [[mathematical_properties_and_noncommutative_nature_of_quaternions | quaternions]] to become the primary language for teaching the description of three-dimensional space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. He even established an official quaternion society to promote his discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

However, other mathematicians opposed this view, arguing that the confusing nature of [[quaternion_multiplication_and_fourdimensional_geometry | quaternion multiplication]] was unnecessary for describing three dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This opposition led to "hilarious old-timey trash talk," with some legitimately calling [[mathematical_properties_and_noncommutative_nature_of_quaternions | quaternions]] "evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. It is even believed that the Mad Hatter scene in Lewis Carroll's *Alice in Wonderland* (Carroll himself being an Oxford mathematician) was a reference to [[mathematical_properties_and_noncommutative_nature_of_quaternions | quaternions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The chaotic table placement changes in the scene are thought to mock their [[quaternion_multiplication_and_fourdimensional_geometry | multiplication]], and certain quotes referenced their [[mathematical_properties_and_noncommutative_nature_of_quaternions | non-commutative nature]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Resurgence and Modern Significance

Approximately a century later, the computing industry spurred a resurgence of [[mathematical_properties_and_noncommutative_nature_of_quaternions | quaternions]] among programmers working with graphics, robotics, and anything involving orientation in 3D space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This is because they offer an elegant and computationally more efficient method for describing and computing [[applications_of_quaternions_in_3d_rotations_and_quantum_mechanics | 3D rotations]], while also avoiding many numerical errors common in other methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

The 20th century also saw [[mathematical_properties_and_noncommutative_nature_of_quaternions | quaternions]] gain prominence in [[applications_of_quaternions_in_3d_rotations_and_quantum_mechanics | quantum mechanics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. The specific actions [[mathematical_properties_and_noncommutative_nature_of_quaternions | quaternions]] describe in four dimensions are relevant to the mathematical description of two-state systems, such as electron spin or photon polarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Mathematical Properties

[[mathematical_properties_and_noncommutative_nature_of_quaternions | Quaternions]] are formed by extending real numbers with three imaginary dimensions, represented by the units `i`, `j`, and `k` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. These three imaginary dimensions are mutually perpendicular to the real number line and to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. Each quaternion can be written using four real numbers and resides in four-dimensional space, often conceptualized as a real or scalar part and a 3D imaginary part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. Hamilton coined the term "vector" for [[mathematical_properties_and_noncommutative_nature_of_quaternions | quaternions]] lacking a real part and consisting only of `i`, `j`, and `k` components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

### Quaternion Multiplication
[[quaternion_multiplication_and_fourdimensional_geometry | Quaternion multiplication]] can be defined by rules for how `i`, `j`, and `k` multiply together, requiring that everything distributes nicely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. This algebraic approach is how computers perform [[quaternion_multiplication_and_fourdimensional_geometry | quaternion multiplication]], and its compactness compared to matrix multiplication makes it valuable for graphics programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. There is also an elegant form of this rule involving the dot product and cross product, implying that [[quaternion_multiplication_and_fourdimensional_geometry | quaternion multiplication]] encompasses these notions in three dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>.

Geometrically, [[quaternion_multiplication_and_fourdimensional_geometry | quaternion multiplication]] involves a combination of scaling and a specific type of rotation in four dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. The magnitude of a quaternion, its distance from zero, is found by the square root of the sum of the squares of its components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>. Multiplying one quaternion by another scales the second by the magnitude of the first, followed by a unique 4D rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.

A crucial property of [[quaternion_multiplication_and_fourdimensional_geometry | quaternion multiplication]] is its [[mathematical_properties_and_noncommutative_nature_of_quaternions | non-commutative nature]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. The order of multiplication matters; for example, `i` times `j` equals `k`, but `j` times `i` equals negative `k` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. This [[mathematical_properties_and_noncommutative_nature_of_quaternions | non-commutative]] property is common in many groups of actions on space, similar to how the order of moves matters when solving a Rubik's cube or performing rotations in 3D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>.

### Visualization of Quaternions
Visualizing [[quaternion_multiplication_and_fourdimensional_geometry | quaternions]] in their full four-dimensional nature can be approached through [[stereographic_projection_and_visualizing_quaternions | stereographic projection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>. This method maps a 4D hypersphere into 3D space, similar to how a circle can be mapped to a line or a sphere to a plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This projection helps understand the [[quaternion_multiplication_and_fourdimensional_geometry | quaternion multiplication]] as a "double rotation" in 4D space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

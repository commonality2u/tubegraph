An animation created by Paul D'Steff zooms out by a factor of 10 every three seconds, illustrating the vastness of space. This animation was part of a series of videos discussing how [[distance_measurement_in_the_cosmos | distances to objects in the cosmos]] are determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It effectively shows the many seemingly blank orders of magnitude encountered when departing the solar system before the first star is even visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Limitations of Cosmic Zoom Animations

While illustrative, [[limitations_of_cosmic_zoom_animations | these types of powers of 10 zoom outs]] can risk underselling the true scale of the Universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The implied camera position in such animations moves much faster than the speed of light, making distant objects like other galaxies feel almost accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. In reality, traveling at the speed of light would still take approximately 2.5 million years to reach the nearest galaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

When creating the zoom-out animation, there was a significant effort to remain scientifically accurate and avoid falling into the trap of producing only artist renditions of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)

To conclude the zoom-out animation accurately, a simple point cloud was used to represent data pulled from the Sloan Galactic Survey (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This survey essentially [[scientific_mapping_of_the_universe | maps the distances]] to various galaxies across many different directions in the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

The ability to [[scientific_mapping_of_the_universe | map and study]] these galaxies, which are millions and billions of light-years away and beyond direct human grasp, is considered a mind-boggling testament to the powers of science and deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Through such surveys, patterns like the clusters and strands formed by these billions of galaxies in the vast, unfathomable reaches of space can be studied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

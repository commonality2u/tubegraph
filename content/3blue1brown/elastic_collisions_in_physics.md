In physics, particularly when dealing with theoretical models, **elastic collisions** are a fundamental concept used to simplify complex interactions.

## Definition and Assumptions
[[elastic_collisions_and_their_assumptions | Perfectly elastic collisions]] are defined by specific idealistic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>:
*   **No Friction**: It is assumed there is no friction present in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **No Energy Loss**: Crucially, perfectly elastic collisions mean that no energy is lost during the collision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This implies that kinetic energy is conserved. This is a key aspect of [[conservation_laws_in_classical_physics | conservation laws in classical physics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. In a perfectly elastic collision, there would technically be no sound, as sound production would signify energy loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. However, for demonstration purposes, a "clack" sound is often added to indicate a collision has occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Application in the Colliding Blocks Problem
The concept of elastic collisions is central to the [[colliding_blocks_and_pi_computation | colliding blocks and pi computation]] problem. In this scenario, two sliding blocks and a wall are set up, with the first block moving towards a stationary second block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The problem explicitly assumes perfectly elastic collisions to determine the total number of collisions that occur before the blocks slide off indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Idealized Nature
It is important to note that the conditions required for perfectly elastic collisions are "way over-idealized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Such scenarios quickly "depart from anything that could possibly happen in real physics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Despite their impracticality in real-world demonstrations, these idealized conditions allow for the emergence of unexpected mathematical patterns, such as the appearance of pi in the number of collisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. The underlying reason for this phenomenon involves a "hidden circle" linked to the [[conservation_laws_in_classical_physics | conservation of energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

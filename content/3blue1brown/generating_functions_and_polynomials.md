Generating functions are a powerful mathematical tool used to study discrete sequences by encoding information about them as coefficients of a polynomial or power series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:30">[09:30:30]</a>. The core idea is to transform questions about integer sequences into problems of manipulating and analyzing the properties of these functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>, often involving complex numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This approach can reveal surprising insights that are difficult to obtain by direct analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.

## Encoding Discrete Problems with Polynomials

A common use of generating functions is to represent combinatorial problems. For instance, consider the puzzle of finding the number of subsets of a given set (e.g., 1 to 2000) whose elements sum to a value divisible by 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

To approach this using generating functions, a specific polynomial is constructed:
$$(1+x)(1+x^2)(1+x^3)...(1+x^N)$$
where N is the largest element in the set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. For the set 1 to 5, this polynomial is $(1+x)(1+x^2)(1+x^3)(1+x^4)(1+x^5)$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.

### The Role of Expansion
When this polynomial is algebraically expanded (similar to [[polynomial_multiplication_and_convolution | polynomial multiplication and convolution]]), each term in the expansion corresponds to a unique subset of the original set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>. The exponent of 'x' in each term represents the sum of the elements in that corresponding subset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. For example:
*   Choosing '1' from each parenthetical corresponds to the empty set (sum 0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.
*   Choosing 'x' from the first parenthetical and '1' from others corresponds to the subset {1} (sum 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.
*   Choosing 'x' from the first and 'xÂ²' from the second parenthetical, and '1' from others, results in an $x^3$ term, corresponding to the subset {1, 2} (sum 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>.

When all like terms are collected, the coefficient of $x^n$ (denoted as $c_n$) represents the number of distinct subsets whose elements sum to 'n' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. For example, if the coefficient of $x^{10}$ is 3, it means there are 3 distinct subsets whose sum is 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.

## Manipulating Generating Functions

Once the problem is encoded in a generating function, `f(x)`, the task shifts to analyzing `f(x)` without full expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>.

### Basic Evaluations
*   **`f(0)`**: Plugging in `x=0` into the polynomial `f(x)` (in its expanded form) isolates the constant term, $c_0$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>. For the subset sum problem, `f(0) = 1`, which means there is one subset with sum 0 (the empty set) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>.
*   **`f(1)`**: Plugging in `x=1` causes all powers of `x` to become 1, resulting in the sum of all coefficients, $\sum c_n$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>. This sum represents the total number of subsets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>. For a set of N elements, there are $2^N$ total subsets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. For the set 1 to 2000, `f(1) = 2^2000` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>.

### Filtering with Negative One
Evaluating `f(-1)` reveals the alternating sum of coefficients ($c_0 - c_1 + c_2 - ...$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>. For the subset sum problem on the set 1 to 2000, `f(-1)` is 0 because the first term $(1+x)$ becomes 0 when $x=-1$, making the entire product 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>.
This implies that $c_0 + c_2 + c_4 + ... = c_1 + c_3 + c_5 + ...$, meaning half of all subsets have an even sum, and half have an odd sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>.
Adding `f(1)` and `f(-1)` and dividing by 2 provides the sum of only the even coefficients ($c_0 + c_2 + c_4 + ...$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a>.

## The Role of Complex Numbers

To find the sum of coefficients whose indices are multiples of a specific number (e.g., multiples of 5), complex numbers become "unreasonably useful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

### Roots of Unity
The key is to use the **roots of unity**. These are complex numbers that, when raised to a specific power (e.g., 5), result in 1. For the problem involving divisibility by 5, the fifth roots of unity are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:39:00">[18:39:00]</a>.
These roots are located on the unit circle in the complex plane, rotating by equal angles with successive powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:33:00">[17:33:00]</a>. The primary root, denoted as $\zeta$ (zeta), is $e^{2\pi i/5}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>. Its powers $\zeta^0, \zeta^1, \zeta^2, \zeta^3, \zeta^4$ cycle through the five roots, with $\zeta^5 = \zeta^0 = 1$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22:00]</a>. This cycling behavior is fundamental to their utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>. [[exponential_functions_and_their_properties | Exponential functions and their properties]], particularly Euler's formula, provide the framework for understanding these rotations.

### Filtering with Roots of Unity
When evaluating `f(x)` at these roots of unity and summing the results, a powerful filtering effect occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:12:00">[22:12:00]</a>:
*   If the exponent `n` of a term $c_n x^n$ is *not* a multiple of 5, the sum of that term evaluated at all five roots of unity (e.g., $c_n (\zeta^0)^n + c_n (\zeta^1)^n + ... + c_n (\zeta^4)^n$) will cancel out to 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:48:00">[22:48:00]</a>. This is because the sum of the roots of unity themselves (or any permutation of them) is 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>.
*   If the exponent `n` *is* a multiple of 5, each $(\zeta^k)^n$ term will evaluate to 1 (since $n$ is a multiple of 5, $(\zeta^k)^n = (\zeta^n)^k = 1^k = 1$) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:52:00">[22:52:00]</a>. Thus, the sum for that term will be $c_n \times 5$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:55:00">[22:55:00]</a>.

Therefore, the sum $f(\zeta^0) + f(\zeta^1) + f(\zeta^2) + f(\zeta^3) + f(\zeta^4)$ equals $5 \times (c_0 + c_5 + c_{10} + ...)$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:18:00">[23:18:00]</a>. Dividing this sum by 5 directly gives the desired count of subsets whose sums are divisible by 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:24:00">[23:24:00]</a>.

### Calculating the Roots of Unity Sum
To apply this, one needs to evaluate `f(x)` at each of the roots. For the generating function $(1+x)(1+x^2)...(1+x^{2000})$, evaluating it at a root of unity $\zeta^k$ (where $k \neq 0$) means calculating:
$$f(\zeta^k) = (1+\zeta^k)(1+(\zeta^k)^2)...(1+(\zeta^k)^{2000})$$
Since powers of $\zeta^k$ repeat every 5 terms, this long product can be grouped into 400 repetitions of the product of the first five terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:43:00">[24:43:00]</a>:
$$(1+\zeta^k)(1+\zeta^{2k})(1+\zeta^{3k})(1+\zeta^{4k})(1+\zeta^{5k}) \times ... \times (1+\zeta^k)(1+\zeta^{2k})...$$
The product of the first five terms $(1+x)(1+x^2)(1+x^3)(1+x^4)(1+x^5)$ can be precisely evaluated using the factorization of $z^5 - 1$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:25:00">[27:25:00]</a>:
$$z^5 - 1 = (z-\zeta^0)(z-\zeta^1)(z-\zeta^2)(z-\zeta^3)(z-\zeta^4)$$
By dividing by $(z-1)$ and substituting $z = -1$, it can be shown that $(1+\zeta^1)(1+\zeta^2)(1+\zeta^3)(1+\zeta^4)(1+\zeta^0)$ evaluates to $2$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:30:00">[28:30:00]</a>.
Consequently, for any $k \in \{1,2,3,4\}$, $f(\zeta^k) = 2^{400}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:55:00">[28:55:00]</a>.
For $\zeta^0=1$, $f(1) = 2^{2000}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:16:00">[29:16:00]</a>.

Summing these up:
$f(1) + f(\zeta) + f(\zeta^2) + f(\zeta^3) + f(\zeta^4) = 2^{2000} + 4 \times 2^{400}$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:38:00">[29:38:00]</a>.
The final answer for the number of subsets with sums divisible by 5 is therefore:
$$\frac{1}{5} (2^{2000} + 4 \times 2^{400})$$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:42:00">[29:42:00]</a>.

## Broader Implications

The technique of using generating functions and complex analysis to solve discrete problems is widespread and powerful:

*   **Riemann Hypothesis**: The modern understanding of prime number distribution involves studying the Riemann zeta function, which is a Dirichlet series (a type of generating function) whose properties are analyzed using complex-valued inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. Questions about primes are often easier to answer by analyzing this complex function than by directly studying primes themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
*   **Frequency Analysis**: The use of roots of unity to detect "frequency information" is a core idea in [[fourier_transforms | Fourier transforms]] and Fourier series, which are fundamental in signal processing, image analysis, and many other scientific fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:52:00">[33:52:00]</a>.
*   **Quantum Computing**: Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers on quantum computers leverages the use of roots of unity to detect frequency information in a quantum system, allowing for significantly faster computation than classical methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:59:00">[33:59:00]</a>.

These examples highlight how extending mathematical domains to include complex numbers offers greater power in making deductions about seemingly unrelated discrete problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:22:00">[32:22:00]</a>.

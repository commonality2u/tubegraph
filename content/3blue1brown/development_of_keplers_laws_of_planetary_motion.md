The development of [[keplers_contributions_to_astronomy | Kepler's laws]] stemmed from his initial attempt to prove what he considered "the most elegant theory in astronomy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Kepler's Initial Theory

[[Keplers_model_of_the_solar_system | Kepler's model]] involved a geometric theory based on nesting Platonic solids and spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. He envisioned a sequence:
*   A sphere inscribed within an octahedron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.
*   The smallest possible sphere fitted around that octahedron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
*   The smallest possible icosahedron around that sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.
*   Another sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   A dodecahedron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   One more sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   A tetrahedron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   One more sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   A cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   A final sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

This construction resulted in six spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Kepler believed that the ratios between the sizes of these spheres would match the ratios of the orbits for the six then-known planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. He felt this concept was a "very natural or Universal set of ratios" because it was based on Platonic solids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Data Analysis and Discovery

To confirm his theory, Kepler obtained [[historical_orbital_data_analysis | orbital data]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. His method of analysis was described as "completely heroic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. However, his initial theory did not fit the observed data, consistently being off by a few percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

Despite starting with an incorrect premise, this rigorous pursuit of his theory led Kepler to become the first person to understand the actual motion of planets around the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This work ultimately led to the development of his famous astronomical laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

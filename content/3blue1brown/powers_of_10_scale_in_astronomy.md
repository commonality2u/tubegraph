An animation created by Paul D'Step illustrates the vastness of space by zooming out by a factor of 10 every 3 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This animation was part of a series of videos discussing how the [[distance_measurement_in_the_cosmos | distances to various cosmic objects]] are determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Strengths of the Visualization
The animation effectively demonstrates the immense emptiness of space, particularly how many "blank orders of magnitude" exist between the solar system and the first visible star <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Challenges and Limitations
While useful, [[patterns_and_powers_of_two_in_mathematics | powers of 10]] zoom-outs can potentially "undersell the true scale of the Universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The implied camera speed in such animations far exceeds the cosmic speed limit, the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This can misleadingly make distant objects, like other galaxies, appear more accessible than they are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. For instance, traveling at the [[impact_of_astronomical_units_on_light_speed | speed of light]], it would still take approximately 2.5 million years to reach the nearest galaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Scientific Accuracy and Mapping Distant Galaxies
There was a significant challenge in scientifically accurately concluding the zoom-out without resorting to artistic renditions of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The solution was to use a simple point cloud representing data from the [[galaxies_and_the_sloan_digital_sky_survey | Sloan Galactic Survey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This survey essentially [[scientific_mapping_of_the_universe | maps]] the distances to numerous galaxies in various directions across the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

It is considered a remarkable feat of science and deduction that humanity can map and study patterns, such as the clusters and strands formed by billions of galaxies, despite them being millions and billions of light-years away and seemingly beyond our grasp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

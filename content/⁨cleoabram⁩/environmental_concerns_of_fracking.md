[[Fracking and its impact on energy production | Fracking]], also known as "hydraulic fracturing," is a method energy companies use to extract oil and gas from deep underground rock formations where fossil fuels are trapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The process involves drilling into the rock and pumping in fluid at high enough pressure to crack it open, allowing the trapped oil and natural gas to escape into pipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

In the mid-2000s, American politicians were concerned about the nation's dependence on foreign oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. While companies worldwide typically extracted fossil fuels from deposits about a mile underground, deeper reserves trapped in harder rock represented a path to energy independence for American companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The perfection of [[Fracking and its impact on energy production | fracking]] technology allowed the U.S. to become the top crude oil producer, significantly increasing the availability and burning of oil and natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Environmental Concerns of [[Fracking and its impact on energy production | Fracking]] for Fossil Fuels

Despite its role in energy independence, the widespread adoption of [[Fracking and its impact on energy production | fracking]] for fossil fuels carries significant environmental costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### Climate Change
The primary concern is that [[Fracking and its impact on energy production | fracking]] enables the extraction and burning of more fossil fuels, which directly drives [[The potential of clean energy for innovation and environmental benefits | climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This contributes to issues such as increased fires, extreme weather, and drought, pushing civilization towards exceeding its adaptive capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Water Pollution
Beyond [[The potential of clean energy for innovation and environmental benefits | climate change]], [[Fracking and its impact on energy production | fracking]] has been linked to groundwater pollution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The fluid used to crack rock contains chemicals that are effective for oil and gas extraction but are harmful to people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

Specific concerns include:
*   **Surface Accidents:** Accidents on the surface, especially with leftover fluids that come up after [[Fracking and its impact on energy production | fracking]], can pollute drinking water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Pipe Cracks:** While less common if pipes are operating correctly, cracks in pipes extending underground could also pose a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Induced Earthquakes
Another significant concern is that [[Fracking and its impact on energy production | fracking]] may contribute to an increase in earthquakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. The primary cause of these seismic events is not the fracturing of rock itself, but rather the disposal of the nasty leftover fluid by injecting it back into the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. In the U.S., earthquakes linked to oil and gas operations have been primarily related to wastewater injection into basement rock, not hydraulic fracturing directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Despite the risks, injecting wastewater underground is considered the best alternative, as keeping it on the surface would be more environmentally problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## Potential for Redemption: [[Enhanced geothermal systems with fracking technology | Geothermal Energy]]

Despite the environmental challenges associated with fossil fuel [[Fracking and its impact on energy production | fracking]], the underlying technology might be key to unlocking a vast source of clean energy: [[Enhanced geothermal systems with fracking technology | geothermal energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The Earth's heat content is immense, with estimates suggesting that just 0.1% could supply humanity's total energy needs for 2 million years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

Traditionally, [[Enhanced geothermal systems with fracking technology | geothermal energy]] has been harnessed by tapping into natural reservoirs of hot water and steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. However, to access the much larger untapped reserves, scientists are working on "[[Enhanced geothermal systems with fracking technology | enhanced geothermal systems]]" (EGS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. This involves drilling down, injecting water into hot rock, cracking the rock to allow water to pass through, and then collecting the heated water to spin a turbine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Conceptually, this rock-cracking process is the same as [[Fracking and its impact on energy production | fracking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

### Addressing Environmental Concerns in [[Enhanced geothermal systems with fracking technology | Geothermal Fracking]]
The environmental concerns raised by fossil fuel [[Fracking and its impact on energy production | fracking]] are being addressed in the context of [[Enhanced geothermal systems with fracking technology | geothermal]] applications:

*   **Fluid Composition:** Unlike fossil fuel [[Fracking and its impact on energy production | fracking]] which uses harmful chemicals, [[Enhanced geothermal systems with fracking technology | enhanced geothermal systems]] typically inject only water or fluids very similar to water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. These "environmentally benign fluids" mean that the main source of objection to [[Fracking and its impact on energy production | fracking]] (toxic chemicals) does not apply to [[Enhanced geothermal systems with fracking technology | geothermal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

*   **Induced Earthquakes:** The concern about seismic activity does apply, though to a lesser extent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. While poor practices could create seismic activity, especially in older [[Enhanced geothermal systems with fracking technology | geothermal]] projects, scientific advancements have significantly reduced this risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Experts believe it can be done safely, emphasizing the need to prioritize prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

While there are still alternative [[The potential of clean energy for innovation and environmental benefits | clean energy]] options like closed-loop [[Enhanced geothermal systems with fracking technology | geothermal systems]] (where no fluids leave the pipes) or continued focus on wind and solar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, [[Fracking and its impact on energy production | fracking]] in [[Enhanced geothermal systems with fracking technology | enhanced geothermal]] applications could significantly increase energy extraction rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. The potential exists for this technology, which contributed to [[The potential of clean energy for innovation and environmental benefits | climate change]], to help mitigate it, representing a "redemption story" for how technology can be used to improve the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

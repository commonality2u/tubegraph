A Farnsworth fusor is a compact device capable of achieving nuclear fusion on a small scale, distinct from commercial-grade reactors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This type of device can be built and operated outside of large industrial or governmental facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion_and_its_principles | Principles of Nuclear Fusion]]

[[basics_of_nuclear_fusion | Nuclear fusion]] involves forcing two particles together at very high energies until they fuse and form a heavier particle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This process requires significant energy, typically delivered through high voltage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

In a fusor, two deuterium atoms—each consisting of a neutron and a proton—are fused together to form helium-4, which has two protons and two neutrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The resulting helium-4 molecule is extremely hot, and this heat is the energy harvested from the reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Each fusion reaction produces "tremendously more energy than it took to actually fuse them together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Confinement Methods

All fusion devices, including the Farnsworth fusor, utilize a vacuum chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Different approaches are used to confine the plasma needed for fusion:
*   **Gravitational Confinement** The Sun uses gravity to confine plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Magnetic Confinement** This method uses magnets to confine plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Inertial Confinement** One form uses lasers to push plasma close together, leading to fusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

The Farnsworth fusor employs [[electrostatic_inertial_confinement_in_fusion_devices | electrostatic inertial confinement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. In this spherical setup, ions stream in from all angles towards a central core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. As these ions collide in the core, fusion occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### [[challenges_in_nuclear_fusion_energy_production | Challenges in Nuclear Fusion]]

While individual fusion reactions yield immense energy, a primary [[challenges_in_achieving_sustainable_nuclear_fusion | challenge in achieving sustainable nuclear fusion]] is generating enough net electricity from the entire system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The energy output from the atomic reaction is significant, but the difficulty lies in getting more total electricity out of the system built to facilitate the reaction than what is put into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Building and Operating a Fusor

The process of building and operating a Farnsworth fusor involves several key steps:

### Construction
1.  **Vacuum Chamber Assembly** The first step is to assemble the vacuum chamber, which involves rotating a turbo pump into place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
2.  **Safety Precautions** Working with high voltage requires strict safety protocols, such as avoiding two-handed contact and keeping body parts away from the energized components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
3.  **Vacuum Pumping** Air is extracted from the chamber using a roughing pump and then a turbo pump to create a high vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Leaks in the system can hinder the vacuum process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Achieving a sufficient vacuum is crucial, as air molecules prevent fusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Operation
1.  **Fuel Introduction** Deuterium gas is slowly introduced into the evacuated chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
2.  **Power Supply Activation** The power supply is connected, and voltage is gradually increased (e.g., to 6000 volts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
3.  **Plasma Formation** As the voltage and gas pressure reach appropriate levels, plasma forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. The current is kept low once plasma starts to flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. The deuterium plasma appears as a fuchsia color due to the combination of blue and bright red photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
4.  **Achieving Fusion** Fusion occurs when the plasma reaches the correct density, pressure, and voltage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This is visually evident through the formation of a "core" and "pinch points" within the plasma, where ions are focused and blast inward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Monitoring the machine's sounds is also important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
5.  **Sustaining Plasma** Maintaining precise gas control is essential to sustain the plasma for long enough to confirm fusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. If the gas decays too much, the plasma cannot be sustained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## Fusors vs. Commercial [[commercial_applications_and_future_of_nuclear_fusion | Fusion Reactors]]

While a fusor demonstrates the principles of fusion, it is not a commercial electricity system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. Commercial [[fusion_reactor_experiments_and_societal_impact | nuclear fusion]] systems are typically larger and more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Examples of commercial-scale devices include stellarators (twisty and turny) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, Helion's cylindrical devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, and tokamaks (donut-shaped with a D-shaped cross-section) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

Private companies and governments are now building systems capable of commercial levels of fusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. The goal is to get these systems on the electrical grid as quickly as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. Experts believe that electricity from fusion could be available on the grid within our lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

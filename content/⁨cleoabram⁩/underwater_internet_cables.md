The vast majority of current international internet traffic, estimated to be up to 99%, is carried by [[importance_of_detailed_ocean_mapping | underwater internet cables]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. As of 2021, there were approximately 436 such cables in service, spanning over 800,000 miles across the world's oceans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## How They Work

[[importance_of_detailed_ocean_mapping | Underwater internet cables]] transmit information as flashes of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This information, composed of binary "1s and 0s," is sent millions of times per second down tiny glass fibers across entire oceans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This method, using visible light, has historically been faster, cheaper, and more reliable than satellite communication methods that use radio waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

### Bandwidth and Latency

When discussing internet performance, two key terms are:
*   **Bandwidth**: Analogous to the width of a water pipe, bandwidth refers to how much information (measured in megabits per second) can pass through in a set period of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. A "bit" is a single "1" or "0" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Latency**: Like the length of the pipe, latency is the time it takes for information to travel from one end to the other, measured in milliseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

For optimal internet performance, high bandwidth and low latency are desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Installation and Placement

[[importance_of_detailed_ocean_mapping | Underwater internet cables]] are laid by specialized ships that load the cable and slowly traverse the ocean, typically at speeds around 6 knots (7 miles per hour) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This process can take weeks, as the cable is continuously dropped off the back of the vessel, forming a literal web around the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

Despite the extreme depths of certain ocean trenches (some deeper than Mount Everest is tall), cable-laying companies do not build bridges or allow cables to hang suspended in the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Instead, enough cable is laid for it to settle all the way to the ocean floor, even in deep parts. This process is difficult and expensive, leading companies to try and avoid the deepest areas of the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Public Perception

Many people mistakenly believe that the internet primarily resides in space, rather than underwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This perception is influenced by common terminology like "the cloud," "upload," and "download" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## Limitations and the Rise of Satellite Internet

While the existing [[importance_of_detailed_ocean_mapping | internet infrastructure]] based on cables is a marvel of human ingenuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, it has limitations, leading to the ongoing [[the_great_internet_space_race | Great Internet Space Race]] involving companies like [[starlink_and_satellite_internet | Starlink]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, Project Kuiper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, and OneWeb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

Challenges with cable-based internet include:
*   **Difficulty in laying cables**: In some regions, it is prohibitively difficult to install cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Threats**: Ground-based service can be threatened by political instability or war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Financial viability**: Companies may decide it's not financially worthwhile to lay cables in areas with low population density, as there might not be enough paying customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. This can lead to higher costs for consumers in rural areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **[[digital_divide_and_internet_accessibility | Digital Divide]]**: These factors contribute to the [[digital_divide_and_internet_accessibility | Digital Divide]], a significant problem both between and within countries, where many people lack access to fast, affordable internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

While fiber optic cables using visible light are generally faster and more reliable than older satellite systems using radio waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, new satellite technologies, such as [[starlink_and_satellite_internet | Starlink]], aim to provide better, cheaper, and more widely available internet, potentially challenging fiber's dominance in certain areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. However, fiber is still expected to remain superior in the vast majority of locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. The existing internet infrastructure remains a "monument to human creativity, hard work, and the desire to connect," but it is not yet finished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

Traditionally, when people think of nuclear waste, they imagine glowing green goo in yellow barrels—a dangerous, radioactive substance requiring storage for hundreds of thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This perception often leads to debates about the viability of nuclear power, given the challenge of storing such hazardous material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. However, technology exists that could transform this "radioactive trash" into a valuable clean energy resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## A Forgotten Technology

As early as 1962, a nuclear reactor was built by Argonne National Laboratory that could produce electricity from nuclear waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Predictions at the time suggested that by the year 2000, more than half of the country's electric power would come from atomic sources using this technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Despite this early promise, today the United States does not reuse any of its nuclear waste; instead, it simply accumulates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## The Potential of Used Nuclear Fuel

During a visit to Argonne National Laboratory, the speaker learned that there is enough used nuclear fuel (nuclear waste) in the U.S. alone to power the country for the next 150 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. While the exact duration may vary among experts, there is general agreement that current nuclear waste could serve as a significant energy source using existing technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

Beyond generating more electricity, [[nuclear_waste_recycling | reusing nuclear waste]], especially multiple times, can dramatically reduce the period for which the waste remains radioactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. This transforms the problem of storing waste for hundreds of thousands of years to potentially just hundreds of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, making long-term storage much more manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. The primary barriers to implementing this technology are cost and global politics, not fundamental technological limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## The Nuclear Fuel Cycle

### Current "Once-Through" Cycle
Nuclear power plants typically heat a liquid into steam to spin a turbine, which then generates electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. In nuclear power, this heat comes from splitting atoms within special rocks, primarily uranium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Less than one percent of natural uranium is Uranium-235, the "breakable" kind that can sustain a nuclear reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. After enrichment to increase the concentration of Uranium-235, fuel pellets are inserted into metal rods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Neutrons are fired at Uranium-235, causing it to split, release energy (heat), and throw off more neutrons, creating a chain reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

After approximately four to six years, enough Uranium-235 is broken down that the reaction becomes inefficient, and the fuel is considered high-level nuclear waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This spent fuel contains leftover Uranium-235 and Uranium-238, along with unstable atoms that emit ionizing radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. This radiation can be deadly in large doses and remains dangerous for hundreds of thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

Currently, most nuclear waste in the U.S. is stored in dry casks designed to last decades, not millennia, leading to an ongoing debate about long-term solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. This process—mining uranium, using it once, and then storing it indefinitely—is known as the "once-through" fuel cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

### The [[Nuclear waste recycling | Recycling]] Process (Electrorefining)
Argonne National Laboratory is one of the few places in the U.S. still testing [[nuclear_waste_recycling | nuclear waste recycling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. The process involves:
1.  Cutting up nuclear waste into small pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
2.  Dissolving these pieces in a vat of molten salts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
3.  Running electricity through the vat to separate uranium and other useful materials from the waste, creating deposits of useful material on the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
4.  Making new fuel rods from these deposits for reuse in a reactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

This process can be repeated multiple times, not only generating more electricity but also consuming the longest-lasting radioactive materials, reducing the waste's radioactive lifespan from hundreds of thousands of years to potentially hundreds of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

### The [[Closed nuclear fuel cycle | Closed Fuel Cycle]]
This method creates a [[closed_nuclear_fuel_cycle | closed fuel cycle]]: uranium is mined, used in a reactor, filtered, reused multiple times, and then placed into much shorter-term, manageable storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. This is not hypothetical; countries like Japan already implement this, citing reduced dependence on imported fuel, uranium conservation, and reduced nuclear waste radioactivity as benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

## [[Challenges and future of nuclear recycling | Challenges and Future of Nuclear Recycling]]

### Policy Shift and Economic Barriers
In 1977, President Jimmy Carter halted all [[nuclear_waste_recycling | nuclear recycling]] in the U.S. to address nuclear proliferation concerns, specifically the separation of plutonium (a highly radioactive element usable in weapons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. The U.S. shifted away from "fast reactors," which could handle nuclear waste, towards "light water reactors," which are common today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Although President Reagan lifted the ban in 1981, companies had already invested in reactors that couldn't recycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

The main argument against [[nuclear_waste_recycling | nuclear fuel recycling]] today is its high cost compared to using cheap and plentiful new uranium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. However, this incentive structure is changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. The increasing need for diverse clean energy sources and concerns over global fuel supply disruptions are reawakening interest in this dormant technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

The technology for [[nuclear_waste_recycling | recycling nuclear waste]] is not a dream; it has been demonstrated and proven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. The primary step now is to commercialize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. This shift requires changing minds and overcoming fears to fully utilize resources and technology for a better future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
Other energy sources mentioned include [[geothermal_energy_as_a_clean_energy_source | geothermal energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

In the mid-2000s, American politicians were concerned about the United States' dependence on foreign oil, as the country was producing significantly less oil than other nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This led to a strong push to reduce reliance on foreign oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | Fracking]] and Fossil Fuel Extraction
Traditionally, companies worldwide extracted [[challenges_of_replacing_fossil_fuels_with_renewable_energy | fossil fuels]] like oil and natural gas from deposits approximately one mile underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. However, deeper reserves of oil and gas are trapped within harder rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This deeper rock represented an opportunity for energy independence for American companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

[[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | Fracking]], or "hydraulic fracturing," is a process perfected to extract these trapped resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. It involves drilling into rock and pumping fluid at high pressure to crack it open, allowing oil and natural gas to escape into pipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This method, nicknamed "fracking," proved effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, leading to a significant increase in US crude oil production and a reduction in dependence on foreign oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Environmental and Seismic Concerns with Fossil Fuel Fracking
The increased extraction and burning of [[challenges_of_replacing_fossil_fuels_with_renewable_energy | fossil fuels]] through [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]] comes with a cost, increasingly recognized in relation to [[challenges_of_replacing_fossil_fuels_with_renewable_energy | climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Beyond climate change, [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]] has faced opposition due to other environmental impacts:
*   **Groundwater Pollution:** The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has linked oil and gas drilling, including [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]], to the pollution of groundwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The fluid used in fracking includes chemicals that are effective for extraction but harmful to people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Accidents on the surface, particularly involving leftover fluids, can pollute drinking water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Cracks in pipes could also cause problems if not operating correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Induced Earthquakes:** There is a concern that [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]] may be causing a rise in earthquakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. The primary cause of these earthquakes is often the disposal of nasty leftover fluid by injecting it back into the ground, particularly into basement rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Keeping these fluids on the surface would be even more environmentally problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## The Hopeful Twist: [[geothermal_energy_as_a_renewable_resource | Geothermal Energy]]
Despite its controversial past, the technology perfected for [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]] to extract [[challenges_of_replacing_fossil_fuels_with_renewable_energy | fossil fuels]] might be crucial for unlocking a much larger, [[the_potential_of_clean_energy_for_innovation_and_environmental_benefits | clean energy]] source: [[geothermal_energy_as_a_renewable_resource | geothermal energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### The Potential of [[geothermal_energy_as_a_renewable_resource | Geothermal Energy]]
The Earth itself is a massive heat source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Estimates from the US agency researching advanced energy technologies suggest that just 0.1% of the Earth's heat content could meet humanity's total energy needs for two million years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

Traditionally, [[geothermal_energy_as_a_renewable_resource | geothermal energy]] has been harnessed by tapping into naturally occurring hot springs or reservoirs of hot water and steam, primarily in geographically concentrated areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. This involves digging down, finding hot steam, and channeling it through a turbine to generate electricity, or using the heat directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

### Enhanced Geothermal: Applying [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | Fracking]] Technology
A significant amount of [[geothermal_energy_as_a_renewable_resource | geothermal energy]] remains untapped because it's not always found in natural reservoirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This has led to the development of "enhanced geothermal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. Conceptually, enhanced geothermal utilizes the same principles as [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]]:
1.  Drilling down into hot rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
2.  Injecting water at high pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
3.  Cracking the hot rock to create artificial reservoirs, allowing the water to pass through and heat up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
4.  Collecting the heated water to spin a turbine and generate electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

Professor Mukul Sharma, known as the "Frack King" for his expertise in improving hydraulic fracturing processes for oil and gas companies, is now working on applying this technology to [[geothermal_energy_as_a_renewable_resource | geothermal energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. He believes this technology can make [[geothermal_energy_as_a_renewable_resource | geothermal energy]] more commercially viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

## Safety and Environmental Considerations for Geothermal Fracking
While enhanced geothermal uses a similar cracking process to [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]] for [[challenges_of_replacing_fossil_fuels_with_renewable_energy | fossil fuels]], key differences mitigate some environmental concerns:
*   **Fluid Composition:** For geothermal, the injected fluid is primarily water, or very close to it, making it environmentally benign compared to the chemical-laden fluids used in fossil fuel [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. This largely addresses the main objection regarding water contamination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   **Earthquake Risk:** The concern about induced earthquakes remains, but the risk is significantly reduced with modern science and practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Experts believe it can be done safely, provided precautions are taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## [[the_potential_of_clean_energy_for_innovation_and_environmental_benefits | Geothermal Energy]] in a [[challenges_of_replacing_fossil_fuels_with_renewable_energy | Clean Energy]] Future
Although [[geothermal_energy_as_a_renewable_resource | geothermal energy]] currently contributes a small amount to global electricity generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, it holds significant promise for a [[the_potential_of_clean_energy_for_innovation_and_environmental_benefits | clean energy]] future. As the world transitions away from [[challenges_of_replacing_fossil_fuels_with_renewable_energy | fossil fuels]], the use of wind and solar power is expected to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. However, [[geothermal_energy_as_a_renewable_resource | geothermal energy]] offers a crucial advantage: it is an extremely reliable and consistent source of energy, unlike intermittent sources like wind and solar, which depend on weather conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

Alternative [[geothermal_energy_as_a_renewable_resource | geothermal]] systems, such as closed-loop systems where no fluids leave the pipes, are also under development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. While these systems avoid [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]] entirely, they offer a significantly lower energy extraction rate compared to systems that create fractures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. The math suggests that [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]] can extract much more energy from the ground, **if** it can be done safely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

## Conclusion: Technology as a Neutral Tool
While some are wary of [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]] due to its past harms and potential for more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>, the potential to repurpose this technology for [[geothermal_energy_as_a_renewable_resource | clean energy]] offers a unique opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. This represents a potential "redemption story," demonstrating how technology itself is neither good nor bad, but its impact depends on how it is utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. For humanity to transition away from [[challenges_of_replacing_fossil_fuels_with_renewable_energy | fossil fuels]], a diverse range of [[the_potential_of_clean_energy_for_innovation_and_environmental_benefits | clean energy]] solutions, including enhanced [[geothermal_energy_as_a_renewable_resource | geothermal]], may be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

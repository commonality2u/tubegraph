A common [[misconceptions_about_clean_energy | misconception about energy]] is that to slow climate change, humanity must perpetually reduce its energy consumption, leading to a vision of a "smaller, less comfortable life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. However, this perspective is considered "backward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The actual objective is to achieve "vastly more energy" to improve lives globally, all while ensuring it is clean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## The "Fossil Fuel Trap" and Conservation

Historically, as long as most energy was derived from fossil fuels, humanity was in a "trap," where using less energy was the primary option to slow climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Until recently, the necessary [[the_role_of_innovation_and_technology_in_clean_energy | technologies]] to replace fossil fuels were not widely available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

To encourage [[public_perceptions_of_global_issues | public awareness]] and action on climate change, scientists and policymakers often employed a "stick" approach: emphasizing that "We need to use less energy. Terrible things will happen if we don’t" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. This message, combined with efficiency improvements and policy changes, did contribute to slowing the rapid increase in energy use in some countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

For a long time, the prevailing thought was that "energy equals fossil fuels, fossil fuels equal energy, fossil fuels are bad, energy is bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Challenging the "Energy Diet"

According to Matt Yglesias, conservation alone is "not good enough environmentally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Instead, the focus should be on achieving a "net zero economy" with zero-carbon energy sources, which would eliminate the need for conservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Yglesias refers to the current approach as an "energy diet" and advocates for ending it by "wildly increas[ing] our [[challenges_and_solutions_in_increasing_clean_energy_production | clean energy ambition]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This new perspective emphasizes the potential of [[transitioning_from_fossil_fuels_to_clean_energy | clean energy]] to improve lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## Global Inequity in Energy Access

The way we think about energy consumption significantly influences what can be achieved in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Rather than focusing solely on what "WILL go wrong if we fail," there's a need for a vision of "what COULD go right if we succeed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This involves embracing "the carrot" of [[transitioning_from_fossil_fuels_to_clean_energy | clean energy]], promoting it for reasons beyond merely avoiding catastrophe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

While increased energy use in the past, such as by Americans with the adoption of electricity, flushing toilets, and refrigerators, was shamefully associated with climate change, it also fundamentally improved human life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

The most crucial goal is to enable everyone to achieve the quality of life often taken for granted in wealthy nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This realistically requires more energy, which cannot be sourced from fossil fuels without accelerating climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

This issue is a significant point of contention on the global stage. Richer countries, which benefited from fossil fuels to achieve high standards of living, are perceived as telling poorer countries they cannot follow the same path due to climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Matt Yglesias argues that imposing a "ceiling" of current energy consumption, suggesting conservation for countries like Vietnam, Ethiopia, or Nicaragua, is not only impractical but also an unacceptable solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

The sooner more zero-carbon energy sources become available, the sooner this ethical and economic conflict becomes irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. If energy no longer results in harmful emissions, it could continue to improve everyone's lives globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## Future Possibilities with Abundant Clean Energy

A future with abundant [[transitioning_from_fossil_fuels_to_clean_energy | clean energy]] could unlock significant advancements:
*   **Carbon Capture:** Developing machines for direct air capture of carbon dioxide, similar to how trees operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Hydrogen as a Zero-Carbon Solution:** Utilizing hydrogen as a clean solution for various problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **Vertical Farms:** Establishing vertical farms to feed cities locally with drastically less water, greater crop efficiency, and less pollution, though they require substantial energy for artificial lighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   **Desalination:** Making saltwater drinkable using existing technologies that are currently not commercially viable due to high energy costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

These are examples of technologies that are scientifically functional but not commercially viable due to the energy cost. However, if more energy can be obtained from clean sources, these possibilities can be realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

Human history is characterized by finding ways to utilize more energy to improve life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. The goal is not to use less energy, but to use *more* energy in a responsible, clean manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

[[dog_aging_and_lifespan | Dogs]] typically have significantly shorter lifespans than humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Efforts are underway to understand and potentially extend these lifespans, particularly through [[scientific_research_on_dog_aging | scientific research on dog aging]] and genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Quantifying Dog Age and Aging

The popular "seven dog years to one human year" myth is not based on any scientific [[scientific_research on dog aging | research]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. It likely originated from the observation that humans generally live to around 70 years, and dogs to around 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

A more [[scientific_research on dog aging | scientific]] method for comparing a dog's age to a human's is based on [[scientific_research on dog aging | research]] by geneticists at UC San Diego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This [[scientific_research on dog aging | research]] indicates that dogs, as a species, age faster than humans when young, and slower when old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. For example, a 1-year-old dog is roughly equivalent to a 30-year-old person, while a 14-year-old dog is only about 70 in human years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Measuring Biological Aging

Quantifying aging is a core goal for companies like Loyal, which focuses on [[efforts_to_extend_dogs_lifespans | slowing aging in dogs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Aging is thought to involve a series of cellular damages that accrue over time, leading to various diseases associated with older age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

One method of measuring biological aging involves looking at changes to DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Specific modifications to DNA, such as "methylation," are thought to change predictably with age, serving as an "aging clock" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. The UC San Diego [[scientific_research on dog aging | research]] used this methylation clock, analyzing DNA from Labradors collected over 16 years and comparing it to human DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This helps to understand underlying age-related changes, including the onset of frailty, cancer, and other diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## Impact of Selective Breeding on Dog Lifespan

There are shocking [[differences_in_lifespan_between_dog_breeds | differences in lifespan between dog breeds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. A Great Dane, for instance, might live only 6-8 years, while a Chihuahua can live for 18 years or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Generally, larger dog breeds have shorter lifespans than smaller ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

This strong correlation is attributed to human selective breeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Humans "accidentally selectively bred" for genetics that caused growth issues in larger breeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Metabolic Differences and Aging

Small dogs appear to hold a secret to longer [[dog_aging_and_lifespan | doggy life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. While dogs are born at very similar sizes, bigger dogs grow metabolically at a much faster rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. It is theorized that the biological processes that enable rapid growth and large size in puppies do not fully "turn off" or function correctly once the dog is fully grown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This continued metabolic activity is believed to cause large dogs to age at a faster rate and consequently die sooner on average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

## Future Directions in Lifespan Extension

[[Scientific_research on dog aging | Research]] by companies like Loyal is focused on understanding these differences between dog breeds to develop [[efforts_to_extend_dogs_lifespans | treatments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Their aim is to make the metabolism of a big dog more similar to that of a small dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. This could potentially extend the lifespan of larger breeds, though not necessarily to the extreme longevity of the smallest breeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

While there isn't currently a pill available to extend a dog's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, [[scientific_research on dog aging | research]] is ongoing to identify specific genetic areas that can be targeted with drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. The long-term mission of these [[efforts_to_extend_dogs_lifespans | efforts]] is to develop drugs that help dogs live longer, healthier lives, with the added benefit of learning more about aging that could potentially benefit humans as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. These [[potential_genetic_enhancements_and_their_implications | potential genetic enhancements]] represent significant progress in the field of [[dog_aging_and_lifespan | dog aging]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

Nuclear power generates a specific type of waste that has long been a subject of concern: nuclear waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Traditionally envisioned as glowing green goo in yellow barrels, this radioactive material results from used fuel and demands storage for hundreds of thousands of years due to its danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The challenges associated with storing this waste have often led to public debate and apprehension about the use of nuclear energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

However, a different perspective on nuclear waste has existed for decades. In 1962, Argonne National Laboratory developed a nuclear reactor that could generate electricity directly from nuclear waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Developers predicted that this [[nuclear_waste_recycling_technology | technology]] would lead to an "incredible clean energy future," with over half of the country's electric power potentially coming from atomic sources by the year 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Despite this early promise, the United States today does not reuse its nuclear waste; instead, it accumulates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. If implemented, [[the_potential_of_reusing_nuclear_waste_for_energy | this technology]] would transform nuclear waste from radioactive trash into a valuable clean energy resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## The Untapped Potential of Used Nuclear Fuel

Research at Argonne National Laboratory, one of the oldest and largest national research centers in the U.S., has continued to explore nuclear power, including the [[nuclear_waste_recycling_technology | nuclear waste recycling reactor]] developed there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Discussions with companies like Oklo, which are working on new nuclear reactors, revealed that the United States currently has enough used nuclear fuel to power the country for the next 150 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. While the technology for this reuse exists, the primary barrier is the lack of commercial facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

Recycling nuclear waste offers significant benefits:
*   It turns a waste product into a large energy source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   It dramatically reduces the time radioactive waste needs to be stored—from hundreds of thousands of years down to potentially hundreds of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   The main obstacles are economic cost and global politics, not fundamental technological limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## The "Once-Through" Fuel Cycle vs. Closed Fuel Cycle

Currently, the United States largely employs a "once-through" fuel cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. This process involves:
1.  Mining uranium from the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
2.  Enriching it to increase the concentration of Uranium-235, the fissionable isotope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
3.  Using it once in a reactor to generate heat, which produces electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
4.  Storing the spent fuel, which is a mix of Uranium-238, leftover Uranium-235, and unstable radioactive atoms, for an "insanely long time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

The concept of only using the easily fissionable Uranium-235 and discarding the rest was analogized in the 1960s as "using the cream and throwing away the milk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

### The Recycling Process (Closed Fuel Cycle)

Argonne National Laboratory is one of the few places in the U.S. still testing nuclear waste recycling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. The process involves:
1.  Cutting nuclear waste into small pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
2.  Dissolving these pieces in molten salts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
3.  Running electricity through the vat to separate uranium and other useful materials from the "junk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
4.  Creating new fuel rods from the useful deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
5.  Reusing these new rods in a reactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

This "closed" fuel cycle can be repeated multiple times, not only generating more electricity but also significantly reducing the radioactivity timeframe of the waste to hundreds of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

## Global Perspectives and Policy Shifts

While the U.S. adopted a "once-through" cycle, other countries, such as Japan, already practice nuclear fuel recycling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Their reasons include reducing dependence on imported fuel, conserving uranium, and mitigating the radioactivity of nuclear waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

The U.S. halted nuclear recycling in 1977 under President Jimmy Carter to curb the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation, specifically focusing on plutonium, a highly radioactive element that can be separated during recycling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. This policy shifted the U.S. away from "fast reactors" (which could handle nuclear waste) to "light water reactors" (which couldn't) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

Although President Reagan lifted the ban in 1981, companies had already invested in reactors that couldn't recycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Today, the main argument against recycling is its high cost compared to cheap and abundant new uranium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

## Reviving the Dream

Despite these [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_nuclear_energy | challenges]], changing global dynamics are shifting incentives. Concerns over global conflict potentially cutting off fuel supply and the urgent need for more clean energy are prompting a re-evaluation of this previously abandoned [[nuclear_waste_recycling_technology | technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

The [[nuclear_waste_recycling_technology | technology]] to recycle nuclear waste is not a distant dream; it has been demonstrated and proven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. The primary step now is commercialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. By overcoming past fears and leveraging existing resources and ingenuity, [[exploring_potential_future_solutions_to_global_challenges | nuclear waste recycling]] could be a significant step toward a better [[future_of_energy_independence and renewable_resources | energy future]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. As one old film noted, "Not only will atomic power be released, someday we will harness the rise and fall of the tides and imprison the rays of the sun. We have indeed just begun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

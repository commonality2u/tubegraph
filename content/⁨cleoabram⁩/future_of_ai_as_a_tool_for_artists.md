The rapid advancements in AI are causing a significant turning point in the music industry, leading to both excitement and apprehension about the [[impact_of_ai_on_the_music_industry | future of music creation and compensation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. While some view AI as a threat to human artistry and income, others see it as a powerful tool that can dramatically enhance human expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Current Capabilities of AI in Music
[[AI in music creation | AI]] is already capable of producing astonishing results:
*   **Voice cloning** allows for realistic renditions of songs by artists who never performed them, such as Frank Sinatra singing "Get Low" or Johnny Cash singing "Barbie Girl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **New song generation** enables the creation of entirely new tracks, including fake collaborations, lyrics, or melodies, within seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   The background music for the video itself was generated by AI simply by typing in a few words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## AI as a Tool for Human Expression

The core argument for AI's positive impact on artists is its potential to "shrink the gap" between an artist's perfect mental idea and what they can realistically create with existing tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Creativity is distinct from technical skill, and historically, lowering the barrier of technical skill required to express creativity has led to more great music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. For example:
*   Centuries ago, musical geniuses like Mozart or Beethoven were rare, partly because the cost of gathering an orchestra to test ideas was immense, requiring them to compose mentally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   More recently, artists like Avicii used computers as their primary tool, vastly expanding the possibilities for music production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

AI is seen as a new, powerful tool in this progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Artists are already using AI tools like ChatGPT to generate lyrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a> and Google's MusicLM to create new melodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. It's possible that AI-generated music is already being streamed on platforms like Spotify without listeners being aware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Artists Embracing AI Tools

While some artists believe AI should not write lyrics or automatically generate music due to potential [[impact_of_ai_on_human_creativity | negative effects on the human mind]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, others are actively embracing its capabilities.

### Grimes's Approach to Voice Cloning
The artist Grimes has been a vocal proponent of AI voice cloning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. She released "Elf Tech," a tool that allows anyone to change their voice into hers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Through this initiative, she has established a unique model:
*   Two verified "Grimes" artist profiles appear on Spotify: human Grimes and a "collaborator" profile for anyone using her voice via Elf Tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   Grimes plans to feature the best AI-generated tracks using her voice, and she intends to release a "competitive AI album" alongside her own human-made album to see which performs better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This model suggests that users of her voice and likeness are expected to compensate her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

## AI and Compensation: The Copyright Debate

A major point of contention is when artists should get paid in a world with [[ai_art_creation_and_its_implications | AI music]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The music industry's existing copyright system distinguishes between "inspiration" and "copying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

The key question specific to AI is whether training AI on an artist's music should be considered "inspiration" or "copying," requiring compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   AI tools require thousands of songs for training, and the companies using these data sets are not always transparent about their sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   AI tools analyze patterns in vast datasets and create entirely new works, rather than directly sampling, interpolating, or covering existing music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   Currently, the industry largely bases compensation on the "output" – whether the final product sounds similar enough to an original work – not the "input" or training data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   Changing this would mean paying artists for what the industry has traditionally called "inspiration," a significant shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

Daniel Ek, CEO of Spotify, emphasized that Spotify receives audio files and wouldn't necessarily know what tools were used in their creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. He believes the crucial aspect is the "output of that training," advocating for new IP that doesn't confusingly mimic someone else's name and likeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

## [[Future of AI and personalized AI | The Future: AI as an Artist?]]

A more complex scenario arises if AI begins to make music more autonomously, potentially becoming less of a tool and more of an "artist" itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. This could lead to AI agents generating millions or billions of songs, creating questions about IP ownership and whether AI should be treated as a creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

Ultimately, if AI serves as a tool to help humans express more of their "awe and love and joy and fear and jealousy" through music, it's viewed as a positive development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. The hope is that AI can help foster more human connections by empowering individuals who may not have realized their musical talent to create and share their unique expressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. This could unlock a vast amount of human expression currently "locked inside people's minds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

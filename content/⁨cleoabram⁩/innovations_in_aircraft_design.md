Recent efforts are focused on building the future of airplanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, with a particular emphasis on electric aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This represents a significant step in re-evaluating plane design and functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## The Rise of Electric Aviation

A company named Beta is developing a new type of electric airplane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, which is described as a "flying electric vehicle take off and landing aircraft" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> and a "combination of a helicopter and a plane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This development is significant because air travel has historically contributed increasing amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The drive for better planes is seen as a collision course between innovation and the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Historically, electric aviation is not a new concept. Before airplanes, airships, some of which were electric, existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. An example from 1883 used a nearly thousand-pound battery made from zinc and chlorine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. However, early batteries were too large and heavy to compete with liquid fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## [[advancements_in_battery_technology_for_aviation | Advancements in Battery Technology]]

A primary challenge for electric airplanes has been the weight of batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. However, there have been substantial [[advancements_in_battery_technology_for_aviation | advancements in battery technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Battery Composition and Energy Density

*   Beta's battery packs utilize commercial off-the-shelf lithium-ion cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   One of their battery packs contains the same amount of energy as a standard Tesla car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   Energy storage in batteries is measured by:
    *   **Volumetric energy density**: How much energy can be stored in comparison to its size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
    *   **Gravimetric energy density (specific energy)**: How much energy can be stored in comparison to its weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   In 2010, the space required for batteries to output the same energy as aviation fuel was significant, and they weighed 50 times more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   Unlike fuel, which gets lighter as it's burned, batteries do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   Over the past decade, batteries have become significantly smaller and lighter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, benefiting from innovations seen in laptops, phones, and electric cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   Innovation extends not only to individual battery cells but also to how densely they can be packed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   Despite these [[advancements_in_battery_technology_for_aviation | advancements]], batteries are still less energy-dense than traditional fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   A key factor in making electric aviation achievable is the drastic reduction in battery costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## Redesigning Aircraft: Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL)

The new wave of investment in electric planes is leading to a redesign of how aircraft look and feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Beta's electric plane features vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

*   While VTOL isn't solely due to electric power, the innovations work together: electric batteries are heavier, but electric motors are lighter and smaller, allowing for more flexible engine placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   This design rethinking allows access to places inaccessible by conventional aircraft, as VTOL opens up aviation to areas without airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   The aircraft can transition from a multi-propeller vertical flight mode to a single-engine aircraft by stowing propellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   Simulations demonstrate the stability of these aircraft, making them easier to control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## Impact on Emissions and Logistics

While electric planes are not expected to replace large fuel passenger planes for long-haul flights anytime soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, they can significantly reduce emissions.

*   A third of passenger aviation emissions come from short-haul flights (less than 1500 kilometers or 932 miles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   Very short flights account for more emissions proportionally due to the greater percentage of fuel used on takeoff compared to cruising, and the use of less efficient planes on these routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Electrifying these flights can make a substantial impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   Electric planes, particularly VTOL models, are focusing on freight and delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This could also reduce carbon emissions from other sources, such as road transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. UPS has signed a deal with Beta, indicating a potential shift in delivery logistics if reliance on roads is reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

These [[advancements_in_battery_technology_for_aviation | advancements in battery technology]] and [[challenges_in_developing_electric_aircraft | innovations in aircraft design]] allow for a move into the future of aviation without waiting for complete technological parity with traditional fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. The rapid progress in aeronautics since the 1940s suggests continued transformative changes are possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

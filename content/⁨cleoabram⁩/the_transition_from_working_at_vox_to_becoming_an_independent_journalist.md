A video journalist who spent five years working for Vox, primarily covering tech and economics, has embarked on a new independent venture [00:00:43]. Having contributed to Vox's Netflix show *Explained* and its YouTube channel, as well as her own TikTok, she is now launching a new show titled "Let me explain" [00:00:46]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Motivation for a New Journalistic Approach

The decision to go independent stems from a critical observation of how new ideas and technologies are often reported [00:03:33]. The journalist highlights a historical pattern of skepticism towards revolutionary concepts. An old newspaper article from October 9th, 1903, titled "Flying Machines Which Do Not Fly," illustrates this, asserting that it would take "from one million to ten million years" to evolve a machine that could truly fly [00:01:00]. Just two months later, the Wright brothers made their famous assisted flight, proving this pessimistic assessment wrong [00:01:31].

This historical example reveals a common journalistic pattern: initial dismissal ("It’s not possible"), followed by critiques about cost and necessity ("It’s too expensive, they can’t get the cost down," "Do people really need that?"), then labeling it a fad, before finally acknowledging its world-changing impact ("Oh my god, it changed the world") [00:01:43].

### Critiquing Journalistic Pessimism
The journalist contends that while not all journalists engage in this, it's often "easier stories to tell" and "people really like to read them" [00:02:00]. This leads to the question: "What are we missing now?" [00:02:14] She acknowledges that many ideas, both technological and policy-related, are currently in the news, and it's uncertain which will succeed in improving lives [00:02:20]. However, some certainly will, and she aims to engage more rigorously with that possibility sooner [00:02:28].

### The Societal Impact of Constant Fear
The journalist argues that excessive pessimism can hinder progress and contribute to a sense of hopelessness, especially among younger generations [00:02:36]. She observes a prevalent feeling on platforms like TikTok that "The world is just not a good place to live in… That it’s getting worse" [00:02:56]. This perspective is fueled by real problems, but also by "very lucrative fear mongering" [00:03:27].

This pervasive negativity leads to a paradox: "We tell people specific ideas won’t work, we tell them the world is getting worse and it’s scary, and then we turn around and we’re like, 'Oh my god, why are young people so pessimistic?? We need them to fix stuff!'" [00:03:55]. This creates a situation where people feel "helpless and powerless" [00:04:09].

To counteract this, the new show seeks to introduce a more optimistic point of view [00:04:12]. While acknowledging the journalist's responsibility to be skeptical and highlight challenges, she also emphasizes another crucial responsibility: "to help people imagine what could go right" [00:04:15]. This approach aligns with [[the_role_of_optimism_and_skepticism_in_journalism | the role of optimism and skepticism in journalism]].

## The New Show: "Let Me Explain"

The show, "Let Me Explain," will feature deep dives into a single "big idea" per episode, exploring its potential to be "HUGE" if it comes to fruition [00:00:27]. It is envisioned as "Black Mirror, but the opposite," offering "genuinely optimistic explanations about technology" [00:00:18].

### Reasons for Independence
The decision to leave Vox was driven by a desire to cover these topics in a way that felt "really personal" and reflected her "tone of voice" [00:04:48]. Going independent allows for a "scrappier" and more experimental approach to exploring complex ideas [00:05:06]. This shift also signifies a move towards a more personal and self-owned creative endeavor [00:05:16].

### Content and Collaboration
Each episode will take one significant idea and "imagine it works" [00:04:36]. The show will delve into questions such as:
*   What would that world look like? [00:04:40]
*   What needs to be done to ensure it helps the most people? [00:04:41]
*   How does it compare to the status quo? [00:04:44]
*   What could go right? [00:04:46]

The show will feature a variety of voices, including:
*   Incredible experts [00:05:24]
*   Other admired journalists [00:05:38]
*   Family members [00:05:44]
*   The audience themselves, who are encouraged to ask questions and suggest topics that make them pessimistic or overwhelmed [00:05:47].

The goal is to investigate these challenging topics and "find the best ways that we have to solve them" [00:05:52]. While there's no promise that solutions will work, the show promises that the ideas explored "will be huge if true" [00:05:59].

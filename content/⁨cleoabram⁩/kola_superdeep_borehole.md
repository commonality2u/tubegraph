The Kola Superdeep Borehole, located in the USSR, represents the deepest point ever dug by humans on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. It is deeper than the deepest part of the ocean and taller than Mount Everest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## History and Motivation
Digging for the borehole began in the 1970s as part of a "space race" equivalent focused on exploring Earth's interior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. While the United States' similar effort only reached 600 feet before funding was pulled, the USSR continued digging for 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The project ultimately penetrated about one-third of Earth's crust before stopping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Achieved Depth and Operational Challenges
The Kola Superdeep Borehole reached an impressive depth of 12.2 kilometers (approximately 7.5 miles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. No humans were sent down the borehole; the drilling equipment was operated remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. To achieve such depths, scientists had to innovate new equipment and drilling methods capable of piercing through thick, hot, and pressurized rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

Despite these advancements, attempts to extend the hole beyond its maximum depth were met with significant challenges, as the new sections tended to collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. One of the scientists involved in the project described it as a "moonshot which will never be repeated or surpassed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.

## Scientific Discoveries
During the drilling process, scientists made notable discoveries, including:
*   New fossilized organisms dating back 2 billion years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.
*   The presence of water at depths much greater than previously thought possible by scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

## Legacy
Despite its record-breaking depth, the Kola Superdeep Borehole only penetrated 0.2% of the way to the Earth's center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

The development of next-generation spacesuits marks a significant shift in space exploration, addressing both the high cost and limited accessibility of previous designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. For 50 years, no one has returned to the Moon, largely due to outdated spacesuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. However, a major upgrade to spacesuits is making the next chapter in space possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Outsourcing Development

For the first time, NASA has outsourced the production of their spacesuits to Axiom Space, the company selected to build the Artemis III spacesuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This decision replaces the legendary but aging and outdated suits previously used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Driving Down Costs

A primary goal for the new spacesuits is to significantly reduce the cost of both the suits themselves and the expense of getting them into space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

### Historical Context of Costs

Previously, NASA's 1970s spacesuits were reported to cost approximately $150 million each in today's dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

### Axiom's Approach

NASA provided Axiom Space $228 million for the development of the new model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. The strategy is to reduce the cost per suit as more units are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. The new suits are designed from the ground up to be maintained on orbit or during missions, making them much more sustainable and helping to reduce spaceflight costs over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## Enhancing Accessibility

Beyond cost reduction, the new spacesuits are designed to increase accessibility for more people to travel to space.

### Wider Range of Body Types

Unlike previous Apollo suits, which were custom-designed for each astronaut at great expense and with limiting effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>, these new suits are engineered to fit a wide range of body types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. They are intended to cover 90% of men and women in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. This is achieved through a modular design, utilizing small, medium, and large base options, with additional pieces swapped out and tailored for the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. This modular approach is expected to open the door to space for many more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

### Sustainability and Maintenance

The new Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) is designed to be fixable in space, a capability that was basically impossible with previous EMUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. This on-orbit maintenance capability contributes to the overall sustainability and reduced cost of operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

These advancements in [[design_and_functionality_of_the_new_spacesuit_by_axiom_space | spacesuit design]] and manufacturing are crucial for the future of space travel, making it more affordable and accessible for humanity's next steps beyond Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. The rigorous [[challenges_and_testing_involved_in_new_spacesuit_development | testing involved in new spacesuit development]] ensures reliability, while the focus on modularity and in-space maintenance supports long-term goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

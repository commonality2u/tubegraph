For much of history, scientists held various theories about Earth's interior, ranging from a central fire with underground lakes and lava chambers to a "Hollow Earth" with concentric shells [00:04:26]. While early ideas, such as Isaac Newton's suggestion that the Earth's center must be denser based on observable gravity [00:04:40], offered some insight, it wasn't until the early 20th century that scientists could definitively prove the existence of a central core and multiple layers above it [00:04:49]. These discoveries were largely thanks to the study of earthquakes [00:04:54].

## Understanding Earth's Interior Through Seismic Waves

When an earthquake occurs on the surface, it also sends seismic waves deep into the Earth [00:04:59]. These waves are similar to sound waves and come in two main varieties: P-waves and S-waves [00:05:04].

*   **P-waves** (primary waves) are capable of traveling through both liquids and solids [00:05:08].
*   **S-waves** (secondary waves) can only travel through solids [00:05:11].

Both types of waves behave differently depending on the density of the rock they move through [00:05:11]. By measuring which waves arrive at various detectors across the Earth's surface, scientists can deduce the composition and state of the material deep within the planet [00:05:15]. This method has been crucial in understanding how the [[earth's_crust_and_mantle | mantle]] differs from the [[earth's_crust_and_mantle | crust]] [00:05:24].

## Discovering the Earth's Cores

### The Liquid Outer Core
A key discovery was made by observing an "S-wave shadow" on the side of the planet opposite an earthquake [00:05:28]. The absence of S-waves in this area indicated that they could not propagate through a specific region of the Earth [00:05:37]. This evidence strongly suggested the presence of a liquid layer deep inside [00:05:42]. This liquid layer is now known as the [[structure_and_composition_of_earths_inner_and_outer_core | outer core]] [00:05:42]. It is a "liquid soup of metals" reaching temperatures around 4,400° C [00:05:46]. In this region, temperature overcomes pressure, allowing the metals to remain in a liquid state [00:05:56]. The constant churning of this hot metal soup is vital, as it generates electric currents that create the Earth's [[earth's_magnetic_field_and_reversals | magnetic field]] [00:06:01]. Without this [[earth's_magnetic_field_and_reversals | magnetic field]], cosmic radiation would end all life on the surface [00:06:09].

### The Solid Inner Core
For a long time, it was assumed that the entire core was molten [00:08:55]. However, later seismic wave studies revealed unusual behavior when waves reached the very center of the Earth; they were bent and reflected by something in the middle [00:09:05]. Mathematical models indicated that a solid core existed within the larger liquid one [00:09:15]. This theory was later confirmed with more precise wave recordings and improved computational models [00:09:20].

The [[structure_and_composition_of_earths_inner_and_outer_core | inner core]] is a solid metal ball, nearly as hot as the surface of the Sun [00:08:45]. It remains solid due to the incredibly high pressure, which is so intense that iron atoms are physically unable to move [00:09:25].

Even stranger, recent data suggests that the Earth's inner core rotates at a different rate than the surface, and this rate changes, speeding up and slowing down [00:09:31]. Very precise seismic data and computer models of the [[earth's_magnetic_field_and_reversals | magnetic fields]] indicate that the inner core's rotation cycles on a roughly 70-year period [00:09:53].

### The Inner Inner Core (Hypothesis)
There is ongoing debate among scientists about the possibility of an "inner inner core" [00:10:38]. New seismic data hints that iron atoms within the innermost part of the core might be packed differently [00:10:44], though some scientists are not yet convinced this evidence is sufficient to declare it a distinct layer [00:10:52].

## Current Research and Future Goals
Scientists are continually refining their understanding of Earth's interior. The cutting edge of research involves finding new ways to analyze seismic waves with better computational models [00:11:05] and even replicating the extreme conditions of the deep Earth on the surface in experiments [00:11:07]. These efforts aim to answer questions such as predicting the Earth's [[earth's_magnetic_field_and_reversals | magnetic field]] behavior and when it might next flip [00:10:57].

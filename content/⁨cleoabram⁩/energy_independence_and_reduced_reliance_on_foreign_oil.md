In the mid-2000s, American politicians were significantly focused on charts showing the US producing less oil than other nations, leading to an urgent push to "end the dependence on foreign oil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, "Lessen our dependence on foreigh oil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, and "cut its dependence on foreign oil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

At the time, energy companies primarily extracted fossil fuels like oil and natural gas from deposits located about a mile underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. However, deeper reserves of oil and gas were trapped within harder rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. For American companies, accessing these deeper reserves represented a path to energy independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, driven by the belief that "The single most important thing we can do is reduce our dependence on foreign oil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## The Role of Fracking

To achieve this goal, companies perfected technologies to drill into the harder rock and pump fluid at high pressure to crack it open, allowing the trapped oil and natural gas to escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This process became known as [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, or "hydraulic fracturing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

The implementation of [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]] proved effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. American dependence on foreign oil decreased each year since the mid-2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. By the previous year, the US had become the top producer of crude oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | Fracking]] enabled significantly more oil and natural gas to be extracted and burned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Consequences of Increased Fossil Fuel Reliance

While achieving energy independence, this increased reliance on fossil fuels came at a cost, particularly in the form of climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Beyond climate change, [[environmental_concerns_associated_with_fracking | environmental concerns associated with fracking]] include:
*   **Groundwater pollution**: The EPA linked [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]] to groundwater pollution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This can occur from accidents on the surface, especially with leftover fluids, and potentially from cracks in pipes if not operating correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The fluid used contains chemicals that are effective for extraction but harmful to people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Induced earthquakes**: There are concerns that [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]] may contribute to an increase in earthquakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. The primary cause of these earthquakes is often the injection of nasty leftover wastewater back into the ground, particularly into basement rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

Despite these concerns, injecting wastewater back into the ground is considered the best alternative, as keeping it on the surface would be more environmentally problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## A Potential Future: Leveraging Fracking for Clean Energy

Even if the direct [[environmental_concerns_associated_with_fracking | environmental concerns associated with fracking]] are set aside, continued reliance on fossil fuels means contributing to a planet harder to live on, signaling a long-term business challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

However, the same technology perfected for fossil fuel extraction might be key to unlocking a vast source of [[transitioning_from_fossil_fuels_to_clean_energy | clean energy]]: [[geothermal_energy_as_a_clean_energy_source | geothermal energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The Earth contains an "almost limitless renewable source" of heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, with just 0.1% of its heat content potentially supplying humanity’s total energy needs for two million years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

Traditional [[geothermal_energy_as_a_clean_energy_source | geothermal energy]] involves tapping into natural reservoirs of hot water and steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. However, a significant amount of [[geothermal_energy_as_a_clean_energy_source | geothermal energy]] remains untapped because it requires finding natural reservoirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

"Enhanced geothermal" aims to create these reservoirs by drilling down, injecting water, and cracking hot rock to allow water to pass through, then collecting the heated water to generate electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]>. Conceptually, this middle part—cracking the rock by injecting fluids at high pressure—is what [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]] is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]>.

One expert in making [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | hydraulic fracturing]] processes better, Professor Mukul Sharma, now views this technology as crucial for [[geothermal_energy_as_a_clean_energy_source | geothermal energy]] to become more commercial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]>.

### Safety and Potential
The environmental concerns associated with [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]] for natural gas largely stem from the composition of injected fluids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]>. However, with [[geothermal_energy_as_a_clean_energy_source | geothermal energy]], the injected fluid is typically water or close to water, making them "environmentally benign fluids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]>. This means the primary source of objection to [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]] does not apply to [[geothermal_energy_as_a_clean_energy_source | geothermal]] applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]>.

While the earthquake concern still applies, it is less significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]>. Although poorly executed operations can cause seismic activity, the science has advanced to a point where this risk is very tiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]>. Experts believe [[geothermal_energy_as_a_clean_energy_source | geothermal fracking]] can be done safely, emphasizing the need for preventative measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]>.

While closed-loop [[geothermal_energy_as_a_clean_energy_source | geothermal]] systems are in development that avoid [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]] altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]>, they limit the energy extraction rate because fluids come into less contact with the hot rock compared to systems with numerous fractures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]>.

Given the need for extremely reliable energy sources in a [[transitioning_from_fossil_fuels_to_clean_energy | clean energy]] future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]>, [[geothermal_energy_as_a_clean_energy_source | geothermal energy]] could be a significant contributor if enough of it can be harnessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]>. This presents an opportunity to use a technology that contributed to climate change to help address it, demonstrating how technology's impact depends on its application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]>.

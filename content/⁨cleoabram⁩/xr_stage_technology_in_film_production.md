The technological advancements in filmmaking have led to increased complexity and realism in movie production, making it difficult to distinguish between what is real and what is not in modern video content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. This evolution is transforming how media is created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.

## What is an XR Stage?
An XR stage, or "Extended Reality" stage, is essentially a giant LED wall capable of displaying any desired background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. It allows for the creation of a whole live virtual world in the background that perfectly matches the movements of the cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

## How it Works
Unlike older "rear projection" techniques, which used still images or videos behind actors and suffered from a lack of **motion parallax** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>, an XR stage dynamically adjusts the background. Motion parallax refers to the phenomenon where objects closer to the camera shift at a different speed than those farther away as the camera moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. The XR stage solves this by making the background move as if it were a real environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

The stage uses a sophisticated system where a small gadget on top of each camera provides position information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. This allows the "moving window" (what the camera sees) to adjust perfectly, making the virtual background look realistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

### Multi-Camera Capabilities
One of the most advanced features of an XR stage is its ability to display different content to multiple cameras simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. This is achieved by refreshing the LED wall at a very high frame rate (e.g., 120 FPS), with each camera capturing alternate frames (e.g., 60 FPS each) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>. This technology can support up to six cameras, each seeing a different virtual environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Blue-Green Test
> In a demonstration, one camera viewing the XR stage saw a green screen, while another simultaneously saw a blue screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. Crucially, reflections on shiny surfaces also displayed the correct color for each camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>.

## Advantages over Green Screen
Traditional green or blue screens pose a significant challenge known as "spill," where the screen's color reflects onto actors or props, especially reflective surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. This "spill" is difficult to remove in post-production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

> [!CHECKBOX] Key Benefits of XR Stage:
> - **Realistic Lighting and Reflections:** The XR stage eliminates green spill, ensuring that the lighting and reflections on set look correct during shooting, regardless of how shiny the surfaces are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.
> - **Seamless Integration:** It creates an extension of the real set, blending physical props with virtual environments, making it challenging to discern where the real set ends and the screen begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
> - **Rapid Scene Changes:** Production teams can quickly change backgrounds, such as altering the time of day, making productions cheaper and faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. This significantly reduces the need for numerous physical standing sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.

## Impact on Film Production
The XR stage has revolutionized film production, notably for [[disneys_use_of_tech_for_storytelling_and_emotional_connection | Disney's The Mandalorian]], which used an XR stage called "The Volume" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. This technology allowed for gorgeous reflections on characters' reflective armor, avoiding the need to replace it with CGI armor in post-production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. Richard Bluff, visual effects supervisor for The Mandalorian, highlighted how the virtual walls and ceiling cast realistic light and shadows on characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. For The Mandalorian, the LED Volume meant they could load different sets across the entire season, despite only having three physical locations for shooting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.

## Future Implications and [[accessibility_of_advanced_video_production_techniques | Accessibility]]
The [[impacts_of_video_technology_on_the_film_and_content_creation_industry | impact of video technology on the film and content creation industry]] suggests a future where these high-tech movie production methods become increasingly [[accessibility_of_advanced_video_production_techniques | accessible]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>, enabling more people to tell stories with advanced tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:04:00">[15:04:00]</a>. Advances in video technology allow creators to tell stories that were previously impossible, at a much faster pace and lower budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:00">[15:09:00]</a>. The focus is less on the technology itself, and more on what creators can achieve with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19:00">[15:19:00]</a>. There are many stories yet to be explored that are ripe for the existing technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>.

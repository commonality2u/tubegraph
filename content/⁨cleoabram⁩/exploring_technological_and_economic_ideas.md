Johnny Harris has launched a new show, "Let Me Explain," focused on providing journalistically rigorous and genuinely optimistic explanations about [[technological_advancements_and_future_potential | technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The series aims to explore ideas that could significantly change lives if they come true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Harris describes it as "like Black Mirror, but the opposite," intending to counteract the narrative that the world will be terrible in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## A New Journalistic Approach

As a video journalist who previously worked for Vox, covering [[the_economic_and_technological_implications_of_f1 | tech and economics]] for five years on shows like Netflix's *Explained* and Vox's YouTube channel, Johnny Harris brings a background in explaining complex topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. His new independent venture aims to [[engagement_with_new_possibilities_in_journalism | rigorously engage with the possibility]] of positive futures brought about by new ideas, sooner than traditional media often does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

The inspiration for this new approach stemmed from an old newspaper article from October 9th, 1903, titled "Flying Machines Which Do Not Fly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This article, published just two months before the Wright brothers' famous flight, asserted that flying machines might evolve only after "one million to ten million years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This historical example revealed a pattern in how new ideas are discussed: from "It's not possible" to "It's too expensive," then "Do people really need that?" and "Oh, it's just a fad," eventually leading to "Oh my god, it changed the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Journalists, Harris observes, often find it easier to tell stories about why new ideas are implausible, and these stories are popular with readers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Countering Pessimism and Fear-Mongering

Harris notes a prevalent feeling, especially on platforms like TikTok, that the world is "not a good place to live in" and is getting worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This sentiment is fueled by real problems and "lucrative fear mongering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. He argues that telling people specific ideas won't work, coupled with narratives of constant decline, leads to pessimism and a feeling of helplessness, particularly among young generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

Harris believes journalists have a responsibility not only to be skeptical and point out challenges but also to help people imagine "what could go right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. The show's aim is to foster a more optimistic perspective, suggesting that people could better guide [[technological_advancements_and_future_potential | new tools early]] and collectively course-correct before things go "off the rails" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Ultimately, it seeks to empower people to feel that "there was more that we could do to make the world better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## The Show's Vision and Format

Going independent allowed Harris to explore topics in a personal and experimental way, injecting his own tone and grappling with questions on camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Each episode of "Let Me Explain" will take one big idea and imagine its successful implementation:
*   What would that world look like? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>
*   What is needed to ensure it helps the most people? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>
*   How does it compare to the status quo? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>
*   What could go right? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>

The show will feature incredible experts like Matt Yglesias, David Roberts, and Dr. Tia Jackson-Bey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, as well as other journalists and family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. The creator of Reddit, Alexis Ohanian, is also featured, emphasizing that "when you get enough momentum around such a big idea, there's just no going back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

The show also seeks audience participation, encouraging viewers to ask questions and suggest topics that make them feel pessimistic or overwhelmed, with a promise to find potential solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. While unable to guarantee success, Harris promises that the ideas explored will be "huge if true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

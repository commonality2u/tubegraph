Research into areas such as [[artificial_wombs_and_their_development | artificial wombs]] extends beyond human reproduction to include the vital field of growing organs for transplantation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This specific area of research focuses on growing independent organs, not full human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

## Current Challenges in Organ Transplantation
Organ transplantation faces significant challenges:
*   There are 106,285 people on the waiting list for organ transplants in the U.S. alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This number has increased recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   Seventeen people die daily while waiting for a transplant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   Transplant rejection rates range from 5% to 40%, depending on the organ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Dr. Jacob Hanna's Research and Motivation
Dr. Jacob Hanna is a leading researcher whose work on growing mouse embryos in an artificial environment is directly motivated by the challenges of organ transplantation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. His "holy grail" is to develop a method where a patient, for example, with liver disease, could provide a drop of blood to create a structure containing their own liver cells for transplant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

The benefits of such a development include:
*   Eliminating the need to find donors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   Preventing transplant rejection, as the DNA of the grown organ would be identical to the patient's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

Dr. Hanna's research contributes to understanding organ development, which is crucial for achieving this goal and ultimately saving more lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

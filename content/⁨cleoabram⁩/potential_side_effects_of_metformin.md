The decision to take metformin, particularly for purposes beyond diabetes management, involves weighing its perceived benefits against potential side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Dr. Nir Barzilai, an expert on aging, outlines some of these effects.

## Common Side Effects
Metformin has "very common side effects in the first week of use" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. These can include:
*   **Early satiety** (feeling not hungry) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>
*   **Upset stomach** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>
*   **Diarrhea** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>

## Impact on Exercise
Metformin can also affect how the body responds to exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. While muscle capacity may still increase with exercise, the "muscle wouldn't be as big" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a> when taking the drug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

## Personal Considerations
Ultimately, the choice to take metformin, especially for [[metformin_as_an_antiaging_drug | anti-aging]] purposes, is a personal one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Individuals weigh their perceived benefits against these potential side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, considering factors such as their view of existing [[research_on_metformins_effects_on_aging | studies]] and how urgently aging feels to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

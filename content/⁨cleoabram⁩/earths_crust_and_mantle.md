The Earth is composed of several distinct layers, much like a giant onion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. Early theories about Earth's interior ranged from a central fire with underground lakes and lava chambers, to a hollow Earth potentially with concentric shells and life on each ring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. Isaac Newton suggested that the material at the Earth's center must be denser than the surface based on observable gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. Modern understanding, largely developed since the early 20th century, confirms that the Earth has a central core and multiple layers above it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

The layered structure of the Earth formed at its beginning when the entire planet was a molten magma ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. During this period, the densest materials, like iron metal, sank to form the core, while lighter minerals floated to the top, resulting in segregation by density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

## The Earth's Crust

The Earth's crust is the outermost solid layer of the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. On land, it typically measures less than 40 kilometers deep, which is shorter than the length of a marathon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. As one descends into the crust, the temperature gradually increases, rising by approximately 25 degrees Celsius for every kilometer deeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:00:13]</a>.

Within the crust, layers of soil and hard rock are found, along with precious metals and fossils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. Humans have constructed impressively deep structures within the crust, including:
*   The Kamioka and Sanford research Labs, which conduct dark matter and neutrino physics research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.
*   China's nuclear command bunker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.
*   The deepest discovered cave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
*   Some of the world's deepest mines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

### The Kola Superdeep Borehole

The deepest point ever dug by humans is the Kola Superdeep Borehole, excavated by the USSR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This hole is deeper than the deepest part of the ocean and taller than Mount Everest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Digging commenced in the 1970s and continued for 20 years, reaching a depth of 12.2 kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. The project made it about a third of the way through Earth's crust before stopping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

No humans were sent down the borehole; the equipment was operated remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. To achieve such depths, scientists had to invent new equipment and drilling methods to penetrate the thick, hot, and pressurized rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. Along the way, they discovered new fossilized organisms dating back 2 billion years and found water much deeper than previously thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. Despite several attempts, further drilling was hindered by the hole's tendency to collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. The project was considered a "moonshot which will never be repeated or surpassed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.

Even at its deepest point, the Kola Superdeep Borehole only represents 0.2% of the distance to the Earth's center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

## The Earth's Mantle

Around 30 to 50 kilometers deep, the rock composition changes, indicating a transition from the crust into the Earth's mantle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. Initially, the rock in the mantle appears brittle, similar to the crust, but it is denser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. As the depth increases and temperatures rise to over 1300 degrees Celsius, the rock takes on a "hot plastic" or "gooey" consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. This occurs because, despite temperatures exceeding the melting point of the rock, the immense pressure keeps it solid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

The mantle is characterized by [[structure_and_composition_of_earths_inner_and_outer_core | giant convection currents]], where hot material slowly moves from the bottom of the mantle towards the top over millions of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. This stirring action transports enormous amounts of heat from the Earth's center towards the crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

The Earth's internal heat originates partly from radiation and partly from leftover heat generated during the planet's formation through the repeated smashing together of meteorites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. The Earth is cooling very slowly, a process that will take billions of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

## How We Know About Earth's Interior

Direct access to the deep Earth is impossible, as humans have only reached a depth of 12 kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. Dr. Megan Newcombe, a geologist and vulcanologist at the University of Maryland, describes studying the deep Earth as being like a detective, requiring the assembly of indirect pieces of evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.

Breakthrough discoveries about the Earth's layered structure, including how the mantle differs from the crust, were largely made possible by studying [[seismic_waves_and_earths_core | seismic waves]] generated by earthquakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. [[seismic_waves_and_earths_core | Seismic waves]] are similar to sound waves and come in two main varieties:
*   **P waves:** These can travel through both liquids and solids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.
*   **S waves:** These can only travel through solids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

The behavior of these waves changes depending on the density of the rock they move through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. By measuring which waves arrive at different detectors across the Earth's surface, scientists can infer what is occurring within the planet's interior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. This method has been crucial in understanding the composition and state of Earth's layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.

From: [[⁨cleoabram⁩]] <br/> 

The proliferation of satellites like those used in [[starlink_and_satellite_internet | Starlink]] has raised concerns among astronomers. While [[starlink_and_satellite_internet | Starlink]] aims to provide internet access globally, its presence in low Earth orbit can interfere with astronomical observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

## The Threat to Astronomy
The increasing number of satellites in low Earth orbit poses a significant threat to ground-based astronomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. An astronomer voiced concern about the scale of these deployments:
> "I think it's really a threat to send not a couple of hundred satellites but having 10 thousand, 20 thousand, 50 thousand satellites in low earth orbit..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>

This issue is considered a "big deal" and should not be dismissed, even by proponents of [[starlink_and_satellite_internet | Starlink]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

### Importance of Ground-Based Astronomy
Ground-based astronomy is vital for answering fundamental questions about our universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Beyond scientific discovery, it also plays a role in planetary defense against asteroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

## Finding a Balance
The challenge lies in balancing the need to provide internet access to the remaining 4 billion people on the planet with the need to continue observing the cosmos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. The goal is to find ways to do both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

Potential solutions include:
*   Sharing more precise data on satellite locations to allow astronomers to avoid them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
*   Implementing more regulations regarding where these satellites can be positioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

Dogs generally live much shorter lives than humans, a reality that can be "cruel" for their human companions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. However, there are [[efforts_to_extend_dogs_lifespans | ongoing efforts]] and [[scientific_research_on_dog_aging | scientific research]] aimed at understanding and potentially slowing down aging in dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Debunking the "Dog Years" Myth

The common belief that "one human year equals seven years for dog years" is a myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Veterinarians refer to this as "the myth that never dies," stating it's not based on any research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Instead, it was likely derived from the approximate human lifespan of 70 years compared to a dog's lifespan of about 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

A more [[scientific_research_on_dog_aging | scientific way]] to compare a dog's age to a human's involves a non-linear chart, based on research by geneticists at UC San Diego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This research suggests that dogs, as a species, age faster than humans when they are young, but slower when they are old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. For example, a 1-year-old dog is roughly equivalent to a 30-year-old person, not 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Quantifying Aging

One of the core goals of companies like Loyal, founded by Celine Halioua, is to develop a comprehensive quantified aging process for dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Aging is thought to involve a series of cellular damages that accrue over time, eventually leading to age-related diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

A key method for measuring aging is by looking at changes to DNA, specifically through a process called "methylation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Methylation refers to modifications on DNA that are thought to change predictably with age, serving as an "aging clock" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. The UC San Diego research used DNA from Labradors collected over 16 years, compared to human DNA ranging from ages 1 to 103, to understand this biological aging process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This helps reveal underlying changes beyond visible signs like thinning hair or wrinkles, such as frailty, cancer, and disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## [[differences_in_lifespan_between_dog_breeds | Differences in Lifespan Between Dog Breeds]]

Dog breeds exhibit surprisingly different lifespans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. For instance, a Great Dane might live 6-8 years, while a Chihuahua can live 18 years or more, representing a 2x variance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Generally, big dogs live shorter lives than small dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This significant correlation is partly due to human [[genetics_and_selective_breeding_in_dogs | selective breeding]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

The rapid growth rate of larger dogs is thought to contribute to their shorter lifespans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. The biological mechanisms that cause them to grow quickly and become large may not fully "turn off" or function correctly after they are fully grown, causing them to age faster and die sooner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Small dogs seem to hold a secret to longer doggy life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## [[efforts_to_extend_dogs_lifespans | Efforts to Extend Dog Lifespans]]

Loyal is focused on [[scientific_research_on_dog_aging | research]] into these inter-breed differences, aiming to understand what is different between dog breeds to develop treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Their goal is to make the metabolism of a big dog more like that of a small dog, potentially extending their lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This research is currently in the phase of identifying specific areas to target with drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

The mission of Loyal is to develop drugs that help dogs live longer, healthier lives, and in doing so, to learn more about aging that could eventually help people too <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## What Owners Can Do Now

While a definitive anti-aging solution for dogs is not yet available, there are several things owners can do to help their dogs live longer lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The time spent with dogs is considered precious and a "real gift" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. It is significant that human and dog lives overlap at all, and for a dog's entire life, their human companion will likely be there taking care of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

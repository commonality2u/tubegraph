When approaching a [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black hole]], reality as known begins to change, with time warping and a strange sensation of being stretched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Once past a certain point, nothing can escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## The Event Horizon

A [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black hole]] forms when a massive star collapses, squashing its mass into an incredibly tiny space. For example, if the Sun were collapsed to a radius of just 3 kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, the gravity at its surface would be so immense that the escape velocity would exceed the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This means even light rays emitted from the surface would be trapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This boundary, beyond which light cannot escape, is known as the [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### External vs. Internal Perspective

The [[einsteins_theory_of_relativity_and_black_holes | theory of relativity]] states that [[einsteins_theory_of_relativity_and_black_holes | spacetime]] is stretchy and warps in response to matter and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. A [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black hole]] represents the most extreme distortion of [[einsteins_theory_of_relativity_and_black_holes | spacetime]] known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. This distortion creates two very different experiences of a journey into a [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black hole]]:

*   **From an external observer's perspective**: As an object approaches the [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | event horizon]], its time appears to tick more and more slowly, eventually stopping on the horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. The object would appear to be infinitely redshifted, becoming redder and redder as its light struggles to climb away from the intense gravitational field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. From afar, observers would never actually see anything fall into the [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **From an internal observer's perspective**: For someone falling into a [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black hole]], crossing the [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | event horizon]] would be imperceptible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. There is no special feeling or barrier at the horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. However, once past this point, escape is impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This is because space itself acts like a river flowing inward, moving at the speed of light at the horizon and faster than light inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

## Spaghettification

After passing the [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | event horizon]], the next dramatic phenomenon is [[spaghettification_and_tidal_forces_near_black_holes | spaghettification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. This occurs as gravity increases faster and faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. The primary cause is the immense difference in gravitational pull across an object's length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

*   **The Process**: The gravity at one's feet would be so much stronger than at one's head that the body would begin to stretch dramatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This distortion in [[einsteins_theory_of_relativity_and_black_holes | spacetime]] is not constant over the length of the body, leading to both stretching and squashing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. As one gets closer to the [[inner_workings_of_black_holes | singularity]], these effects become so extreme that the body ceases to stay together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. First, the body would be ripped into a long string of atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, then the atoms themselves would separate, followed by the protons, and finally the quarks inside the protons, until everything is ripped apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
*   **Towards the Singularity**: All the ripped-apart pieces continue to race inward towards the [[inner_workings_of_black_holes | singularity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. The [[inner_workings_of_black_holes | singularity]] is not just an infinitely dense point in space, but also "the end of time" according to [[einsteins_theory_of_relativity_and_black_holes | Einstein's theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. It behaves like a future event that cannot be escaped, much like one cannot "run away from tomorrow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

### The Information Paradox and Ongoing Research

According to [[einsteins_theory_of_relativity_and_black_holes | Einstein's theory]], once an object has been [[spaghettification_and_tidal_forces_near_black_holes | spaghettified]] and reached the [[inner_workings_of_black_holes | singularity]], there is no escape; it is "all over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. However, [[hawking_radiation_and_black_hole_evaporation | Stephen Hawking]] discovered that [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black holes]] are "not so black" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. He found that [[hawking_radiation_and_black_hole_evaporation | Hawking radiation]] is emitted, causing [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black holes]] to lose energy and eventually evaporate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

This led to the [[hawking_radiation_and_information_paradox | information paradox]]: if [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black holes]] evaporate, what happens to the information of everything that fell in, given that the laws of nature state information cannot be destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>? Recent research suggests that [[hawking_radiation_and_black_hole_evaporation | Hawking radiation]] is not information-free, meaning the information about everything that fell in is imprinted in the radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

The mechanism by which this information escapes remains a cutting-edge area of research with no agreed-upon picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. Some theories propose that the [[inner_workings_of_black_holes | interior]] of the [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black hole]] might be connected to the exterior, potentially through wormholes, allowing information to "go through the wormholes and coming out again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. Other ideas suggest that there might not be an "in" to a [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black hole]] at all, or that reality is fundamentally based on information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. These concepts stretch the limits of human understanding, revealing the hidden structure of [[einsteins_theory_of_relativity_and_black_holes | spacetime]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

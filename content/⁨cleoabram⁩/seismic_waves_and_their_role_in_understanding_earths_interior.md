Understanding the [[geological_layers_of_the_earth | Earth's interior]] has been a long-standing challenge, often compared to being a detective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Since humans have only directly dug about 12.2 km into the Earth, scientists rely on indirect evidence to decipher what lies beneath the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Breakthrough [[exploration_and_discoveries_about_earths_core | discoveries about Earth's core]] and its internal structure largely came about in the early 20th century, thanks to the study of seismic waves generated by earthquakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

## How Seismic Waves Work
When an earthquake occurs, it sends seismic waves deep into the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. These waves are similar to sound waves and come in two main varieties: P waves and S waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **P waves (Primary waves)**: Can travel through both liquids and solids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **S waves (Secondary waves)**: Can only travel through solids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

The behavior of these waves changes depending on the density of the rock they move through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. By measuring where these waves arrive at different detectors across the Earth's surface, scientists can infer the properties of the material they've passed through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## Unveiling Earth's Layers
Seismic data has been crucial in distinguishing the Earth's various layers:

### Mantle
Seismic waves have been a major way to understand how the mantle differs from the crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. The mantle begins approximately 30 to 50 km down, where the rock density changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Outer Core
The discovery of a liquid layer deep within the Earth was made possible by observing an "S wave shadow" on the opposite side of the planet from an earthquake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Since S waves cannot propagate through liquids, their absence indicated a liquid layer, which is now known as the outer core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This liquid outer core, composed of metals at about 4,400°C, churns to generate the Earth's magnetic field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### Inner Core
For a long time, it was assumed the entire core was molten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. However, scientists studying seismic waves noticed unusual bending and reflection patterns as the waves reached the Earth's center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Mathematical models based on these observations suggested a solid core existed within the larger liquid outer core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. This theory was later confirmed with more precise wave recordings and improved computational models <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. The inner core is solid because the immense pressure prevents iron atoms from moving, despite the extreme heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

### Core Rotation
More recently, subtle discrepancies in seismic data have indicated that the Earth's inner core rotates at a different, and changing, rate than the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Precise seismic data and computer models of the [[earths_magnetic_field_and_its_reversals | Earth's magnetic field]] reveal that the inner core speeds up and slows down on an approximately 70-year cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

### Potential Inner-Inner Core
New seismic data suggests the possibility of an "inner inner core" where iron atoms are packed differently, though scientists are still debating if this warrants a new layer classification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

## Advancements in Seismic Research
The cutting edge of research into the Earth's interior involves finding new ways to analyze seismic waves using better computational models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. Scientists are also building experiments that mimic inner Earth conditions on the surface to further understand these phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

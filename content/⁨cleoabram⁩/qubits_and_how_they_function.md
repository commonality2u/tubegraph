[[classical_vs_quantum_computing | Quantum computers]] operate on a fundamentally different principle than [[classical_vs_quantum_computing | classical computers]], primarily due to their use of "qubits" instead of traditional bits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>. This difference is key to understanding why [[classical_vs_quantum_computing | quantum computers]] are a significant technological advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Classical Bits vs. Qubits

### Classical Bits
A [[classical_vs_quantum_computing | classical computer]] relies on "bits," which are typically made of silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>. These bits can exist in one of two states: zero (ground state) or one (excited state) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>. All information processed by a [[classical_vs_quantum_computing | classical computer]], whether words, numbers, or colors, is translated into this binary language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>.

### Qubits
In contrast, [[classical_vs_quantum_computing | quantum computers]] run on "qubits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>. Qubits are more complex than classical bits and do not simply represent a one or a zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>. They can be thought of as a wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. Each qubit carries a probability of being either zero or one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>:
*   A qubit can be "really likely to be zero," which corresponds to a lower energy wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>.
*   A qubit can be "really likely to be one," which corresponds to a higher energy wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.

## How Qubits Function

The operational difference of qubits fundamentally changes how [[classical_vs_quantum_computing | quantum computers]] calculate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. When a [[classical_vs_quantum_computing | quantum computer]] is running an algorithm, the probabilities of multiple qubits interact with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. These interactions can be constructive or destructive, similar to how waves in a pond interact when two points are tapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>.

It is a common misconception that [[classical_vs_quantum_computing | quantum computers]] "try all the options" simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>. Instead, a [[classical_vs_quantum_computing | quantum computer]] "watches" these wave interactions and identifies the most probable answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:03]</a>. As the controller of the computer, the user can alter these probabilities while the algorithm is running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>.

## Implications of Qubits

Because [[classical_vs_quantum_computing | quantum computers]] calculate differently, they excel at different tasks than [[classical_vs_quantum_computing | classical computers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>. They are not necessarily faster at all computations; for instance, a calculator on a phone is perfectly adequate for addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>. However, [[classical_vs_quantum_computing | quantum computers]] are particularly adept at finding structure within vast amounts of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.

The power of a [[classical_vs_quantum_computing | quantum computer]] is often measured by its number of qubits. For example, to perform Shor's Algorithm—which has significant implications for [[quantum_computers_and_encryption | encryption]]—a [[classical_vs_quantum_computing | quantum computer]] would likely need a million qubits or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>.

## Current State of Qubit Technology

As of the transcript, IBM has set a record with a 433-qubit [[classical_vs_quantum_computing | quantum computer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>. While the leap from hundreds to millions of qubits is substantial, experts are confident that this goal will be reached sooner than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>. The progression of [[classical_vs_quantum_computing | quantum computer]] technology is incredibly fast, solving problems that were unimaginable just a few years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>. There are no known mathematical or physical limitations preventing further advancements, suggesting that engineers will continue to find ways to improve the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>.

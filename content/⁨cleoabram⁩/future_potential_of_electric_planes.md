The concept of electric aviation is gaining significant attention due to advancements in battery technology and the urgent need to address the [[environmental_impact_of_electric_aviation | environmental impact]] of air travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. While air travel has profoundly transformed human interaction and global understanding, it has also contributed increasing amounts of CO2 to the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Developing better planes is crucial for the future, and new tools make this possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Building better planes presents an opportunity not only to reduce carbon emissions but also to fundamentally rethink aircraft design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Historical Context and Early Challenges

The idea of electric aviation predates climate change concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Early examples include electric airships, such as one in 1883 that utilized a nearly thousand-pound battery made from zinc and chlorine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. However, it quickly became apparent that batteries were too large and heavy to compete with the efficiency of burning liquid fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Overcoming Battery Limitations

A significant [[technological_advancements_and_future_potential | advancement]] in battery technology has made electric planes more viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Modern electric aircraft, like those built by Beta, use commercial off-the-shelf lithium-ion cells, similar to those found in Tesla cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. A single battery pack in a Beta plane holds the same amount of energy as a standard Tesla car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

While battery density (gravimetric or specific energy) is crucial for planes, in 2010, batteries providing the same energy as aviation fuel would have weighed 50 times more and taken up significant space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Unlike fuel, which burns and lightens the plane during flight, batteries maintain their weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. However, over the last decade, batteries have become significantly smaller and, more importantly for aviation, lighter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. This innovation extends beyond individual cell improvement to how densely batteries can be packed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Furthermore, the cost of batteries has dramatically decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This progress has led to a surge of investment in electric aircraft development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## Rethinking Plane Design

The drive to build new types of planes allows for a complete redesign of aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. While electric batteries are heavier, electric motors are lighter and smaller, offering greater flexibility in their placement on the aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

Beta's electric plane, for instance, features vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. This innovation, while not directly tied to being electric, is enabled by the flexibility of electric motors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. VTOL aircraft can access locations without traditional airports, opening up aviation to new areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## Impact on Emissions and New Applications

Electric planes, even if they primarily serve shorter routes, can significantly impact aviation emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Short-haul flights (less than 1500 kilometers or 932 miles) account for approximately one-third of passenger flight emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Moreover, very short flights contribute a disproportionately higher percentage of emissions due to the greater fuel consumption during takeoff compared to cruising, and the use of less efficient planes on these routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Electrifying these shorter segments can make a substantial reduction in overall emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

Beyond passenger transport, electric planes are also focusing on freight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. VTOL capabilities, in particular, could revolutionize delivery by reducing reliance on roads and potentially cutting emissions from other sources, such as trucking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. UPS has already partnered with Beta, suggesting a future where logistics are transformed by aerial delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

The [[challenges_of_electric_planes | challenges of electric planes]] still include battery range and charging infrastructure, but ongoing innovation promises to address these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Electric planes represent a critical step towards moving into the future of transportation without waiting for distant developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Just as vast strides have been made in aeronautics since the 1940s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, the [[technological_advancements_and_future_potential | technological advancements]] in electric aviation hold immense promise for overcoming current environmental, financial, and technological challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

The public's initial reaction to Boston Dynamics' Spot robot dog has been varied, ranging from amazement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a> and an instinct to pet it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, to finding it terrifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. As these robots become more common in the real world, their deployment raises significant [[Ethical debates and societal implications | ethical debates and societal implications]].

## Current Deployments and Concerns

Robot dogs like Spot are being deployed in various sectors, including fire departments, factories, defunct nuclear power plants, and deep mines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. However, their use by police departments has proven more controversial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

Examples of Spot's jobs include:
*   Inspecting packaging for air leaks at a dog food factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   Inspecting oil rig equipment for corrosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   Inspecting grave robber tunnels in Pompeii for Italian police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   Measuring radiation levels and ensuring safety at the Fukushima nuclear power plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, where it navigates areas untouched by humans since 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

These roles often involve tasks that are dangerous for humans, require constant or reliable inspection, or are simply incredibly boring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Military and Police Interest

Historically, early quadruped robots from Boston Dynamics received funding from the US military, which sought robotic pack mules for rough terrain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. While initial models were too loud, improved [[Technological advancements and future potential of robot dogs | four-legged robot technology]] has reignited military interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

Other companies, such as Ghost Robotics, are actively building robot dog technology for military applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. For instance, in 2020, the Air Force partnered with Ghost Robotics to use robot dogs for inspections at Tyndall Air Force Base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

Police departments have also adopted robot dogs. The New York Police Department used a remote-controlled Spot in 2021 to locate a man hiding after a shooting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## [[Nonweaponization pledges and military interest in robot dogs | Non-Weaponization Pledges]]

The prospect of "robot dogs with weapons" is a significant concern, highlighted by scenarios depicted in media like Black Mirror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. In response, Boston Dynamics signed a pledge asserting that general-purpose robots like Spot should not be weaponized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. They advocate for other robotics companies to commit to similar pledges, aiming to ensure robots improve quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. However, it is evident that not all companies agree on the intended purpose of robot dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

## Societal Questions and the "Platform" Nature of Robot Dogs

Beyond weaponization, there are strong disagreements about other appropriate jobs for robot dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>:
*   Should an unarmed robot dog lead firefighters or police into dangerous areas? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>
*   If Spots can identify a person experiencing a health crisis, should they patrol cities? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>
*   Does it matter if these robots collect video data, especially if other cameras are already present in an area? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>

Robot dogs are described as a "platform" technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, meaning users can develop new capabilities and applications for them by adding different payloads like thermal cameras, acoustic sensors, or lidar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. This flexibility allows for both beneficial and potentially harmful uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. The ultimate future of robot dogs is not guaranteed and requires collective societal decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

Traditionally, nuclear waste is viewed as a dangerous byproduct of energy production, requiring storage for hundreds of thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. However, there is a historical and currently developing [[nuclear_waste_recycling_technology | technology]] that could transform this "radioactive trash" into a valuable [[the_potential_of_clean_energy_for_innovation_and_environmental_benefits | clean energy resource]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## A Forgotten Future: The 1960s Vision
In 1962, Argonne National Laboratory developed a nuclear reactor capable of generating electricity from nuclear waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This development led to predictions that by the year 2000, atomic sources would supply over half of the country's electric power, ushering in an "incredible [[the_potential_of_clean_energy_for_innovation_and_environmental_benefits | clean energy future]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Despite these optimistic projections, the U.S. currently reuses none of its nuclear waste; instead, it accumulates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Understanding Nuclear Power and Waste
Most power plants convert heat into steam to spin a turbine, generating electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. In nuclear power, this heat comes from splitting atoms (nuclear fission) inside special rocks, primarily uranium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

The process involves:
1.  **Uranium Fuel**: Less than one percent of natural uranium is Uranium-235, the "breakable" isotope that can sustain a nuclear reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Uranium undergoes "enrichment" to increase the proportion of Uranium-235 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
2.  **Chain Reaction**: Uranium fuel pellets, about the size of a finger's first joint, are placed into metal rods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Neutrons are fired at Uranium-235, splitting it into unstable atoms and releasing more neutrons, creating a chain reaction that generates immense heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. This heat boils water, spins a turbine, and produces electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
3.  **Nuclear Waste**: After four to six years, the fuel becomes less efficient and is considered high-level nuclear waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This waste contains leftover Uranium-238 and Uranium-235, along with unstable atoms that emit ionizing radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. This radiation can be dangerous in large doses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. The waste remains radioactive for an "insanely long time," sometimes hundreds of thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

### The "Once Through" Fuel Cycle
In the United States, the current approach is a "once through" fuel cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. Uranium is extracted, used once, and then stored, often in dry casks at nuclear power plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. These casks are designed to last decades, not the hundreds of thousands of years required for full decay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. This practice was likened in the 1960s to "using the cream and throwing away the milk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

## [[nuclear_waste_recycling_technology | Nuclear Waste Recycling Technology]] (Closed Fuel Cycle)
[[nuclear_waste_recycling_technology | Nuclear waste recycling]], or a "closed" fuel cycle, involves filtering out still-useful material from the waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Argonne National Laboratory is one of the few places in the U.S. still actively testing this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

The recycling process demonstrated at Argonne involves:
1.  Cutting nuclear waste into small pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
2.  Dissolving these pieces in a vat of molten salts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
3.  Running electricity through the vat to separate uranium and other useful materials from the junk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
4.  Creating new fuel rods from the useful deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
5.  Placing these new rods back into a reactor for continued energy production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

This process can be repeated multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Experts agree that the existing nuclear waste in the U.S. alone could power the country for at least 150 years if recycled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

### Benefits of Recycling
Beyond generating more electricity, [[nuclear_waste_recycling_technology | recycling nuclear waste]] dramatically reduces the time it remains radioactive, from hundreds of thousands of years to sometimes just hundreds of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. This makes long-term storage much more manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

## [[history_of_nuclear_power_and_waste_management | History of Nuclear Power and Waste Management]] and [[global_perspectives_on_nuclear_fuel_recycling | Global Perspectives]]
In 1977, President Jimmy Carter implemented policies to halt all nuclear recycling in the U.S. due to concerns about nuclear proliferation, specifically the separation of plutonium, a highly radioactive element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. The U.S. shifted from "fast reactors," which could handle nuclear waste, to "light water reactors," which are common today and cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

However, other countries did not stop recycling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. President Reagan lifted the ban in 1981, but by then, companies had already invested in non-recycling reactors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. Countries like Japan continue to recycle nuclear fuel, citing reduced dependence on imported fuel, uranium conservation, and decreased waste radioactivity as reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_nuclear_energy | Challenges and Opportunities]]
The main argument against [[nuclear_waste_recycling_technology | nuclear fuel recycling]] today is its high cost compared to using new, cheap, and plentiful uranium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. However, this is changing. Global conflicts affecting fuel supply and the pressing need for more [[the_potential_of_clean_energy_for_innovation_and_environmental_benefits | clean energy]] are renewing interest in this previously abandoned technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

The [[nuclear_waste_recycling_technology | technology]] to recycle nuclear waste already exists and has been demonstrated; the primary hurdle is commercialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. The potential to transform nuclear waste into a reusable resource represents a significant opportunity for our energy future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

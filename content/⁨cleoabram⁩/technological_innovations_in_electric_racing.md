[[formula_1_vs_formula_e | Formula E]] is a fully [[electric_vehicles_in_racing | electric car racing]] series, often described as [[formula_1s_impact_on_car_innovation_and_future_trends | Formula 1]]'s younger sibling that is rapidly growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. It was conceived as a "space program" for [[electric_vehicles_in_racing | electric cars]], with the goal of rapidly advancing technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

## Origins and Purpose
The idea for [[formula_1_vs_formula_e | Formula E]] originated at a dinner in Paris 11 years ago, attended by Spanish businessman Alejandro Agag, former European Commissioner for Transport Antonio Tajani, and Jean Todt, the president of the FIA (the governing body for [[formula_1s_impact_on_car_innovation_and_future_trends | Formula 1]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. They discussed the impending shift towards electrification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>, with Antonio Tajani emphasizing that electric vehicles were the future and that the European Commission would push for electrification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

At the time, [[formula_1s_impact_on_car_innovation_and_future_trends | F1]] could not simply switch to [[electric_vehicles_in_racing | electric cars]] because their races require covering at least 305 kilometers (190 miles) in under two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. Batteries from 11 years prior were not capable of handling such demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. Furthermore, many of [[formula_1s_impact_on_car_innovation_and_future_trends | F1]]'s car companies did not produce [[electric_vehicles_in_racing | electric cars]] in 2011 and did not want the sport to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.

As a result, a new, separate championship, [[formula_1_vs_formula_e | Formula E]], was created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. An exclusive 25-year license was granted to [[formula_1_vs_formula_e | Formula E]] to be the only fully [[electric_vehicles_in_racing | electric]] championship, preventing [[formula_1s_impact_on_car_innovation_and_future_trends | Formula 1]] from becoming purely electric and conflicting with this license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. This license began in 2014 and expires in 2039 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.

## Technological Progression through Car Generations
The advancement of [[electric_vehicles_in_racing | electric racing]] technology in [[formula_1_vs_formula_e | Formula E]] can be seen through its car generations. All [[formula_1_vs_formula_e | Formula E]] teams are mandated to use the same chassis and battery, with their focus on developing powertrain components like the rear motor, inverter, gearbox, and associated software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>. This design encourages investment and experimentation in key [[engineering_and_technology_in_formula_1 | technologies]] deemed most important for electric vehicle advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>.

### Gen 1
The first [[formula_1_vs_formula_e | Formula E]] car, Gen 1, was a pioneering design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. However, its primary challenge was limited battery life, a common issue for [[electric_vehicles_in_racing | electric cars]] around 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. To complete races, each driver was provided with two cars, necessitating a mid-race car swap where drivers would physically exit one car and enter another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.

### Gen 2
After four years of racing with Gen 1 cars, the Generation 2 car was developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>. The major improvement of Gen 2 was its ability to cover twice the distance, allowing drivers to complete an entire race with a single car, eliminating the need for car swaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.

### Gen 3
The Gen 3 car is the fastest and most powerful [[electric_vehicles_in_racing | electric race car]] ever built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. It represents the biggest technological leap for [[formula_1_vs_formula_e | Formula E]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>. Key advancements include:
*   **Increased Power**: Power output increased from 250 kilowatts to 350 kilowatts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.
*   **Reduced Weight**: The car's weight decreased from over 900 kilograms to approximately 850 kilograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>. These changes result in a significantly faster car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>.

### Regenerative Braking System
A significant [[engineering_and_technology_in_formula_1 | technological innovation]] in the Gen 3 car is the absence of rear mechanical brakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. Instead, the cars stop using their [[electric_vehicles_in_racing | electric motors]], which convert kinetic energy back into electrical energy to recharge the batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>. This means that all braking capacity from the rear of the car comes from the electric motors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>. This system can recuperate up to 80% of the energy back into the battery during braking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>. Despite initial "scare moments" during testing where the system didn't always work, it represents pushing the [[engineering_and_technology_in_formula_1 | technology]] forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>.

## Impact on Road Cars
[[formula_1_vs_formula_e | Formula E]] serves as an experiment and a "group science project" to advance [[electric_vehicles_in_racing | electric car]] [[engineering_and_technology_in_formula_1 | technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>. The innovations developed in [[electric_vehicles_in_racing | electric racing]], such as advanced battery management and regenerative braking, are intended to transfer to consumer [[electric_vehicles_in_racing | electric vehicles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>. This will enable future road vehicles to travel more miles, drive faster, be cleaner, and charge much quicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>.

With governments worldwide, including California and the entire European Union, planning to ban new gas car sales by 2040, the [[future of car racing | future of car racing]] must align with the [[electric_vehicles_in_racing | electric]] shift in the consumer market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. If racing championships don't reflect the [[engineering_and_technology_in_formula_1 | technology]] being sold to the public, they risk losing relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>.

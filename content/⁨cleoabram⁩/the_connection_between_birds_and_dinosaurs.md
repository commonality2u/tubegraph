The scientific understanding of dinosaurs has evolved significantly, revealing that a common misconception is that all dinosaurs went extinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. In fact, many scientists consider birds to be modern-day dinosaurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

## Defining a Dinosaur

What scientifically qualifies as a dinosaur is a "phylogenetic question" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. Scientists trace ancestry back to a small, lizard-like creature called an amniote, which lived over 10 to 15 million generations ago and is considered the most recent common ancestor with dinosaurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Over millions of years, the descendants of amniotes adapted, leading to various new species grouped by their characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

### What is and isn't a Dinosaur

Scientifically speaking, everything that descended from a specific branch onward is considered a dinosaur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. This means some animals commonly associated with dinosaurs are not actually classified as such <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>:
*   Pterosaurs belong to a different group of reptiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
*   Mosasaurs, Plesiosaurs, and Ichthyosaurs, although they lived at the same time, are also different groups of reptiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
*   Crocodiles were alive during the age of dinosaurs but branched off earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

However, based on this phylogenetic definition, birds are definitively dinosaurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. They are not merely descendants of dinosaurs, but are considered actual dinosaurs by the most scientific definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

## The [[the_extinction_of_dinosaurs_and_its_impact_on_earths_history | Extinction Event]] and Survival

Approximately 66.04 million years ago, a massive rock wider than Mount Everest and traveling at 20 to 30 kilometers per second struck Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. This impact caused an apocalypse, including a "thermal pulse" (a wave of heat) and mega tsunamis across the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. The ejecta from the impact blocked out the sun, leading to the death of plants and subsequently, the animals that relied on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

The creatures that survived this cataclysm were typically small (the size of a German Shepherd or smaller) and had refugia, meaning they could retreat into water or live underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. After 180 million years, the reign of the large non-avian dinosaurs effectively ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. This "bad day on planet Earth for the dinosaurs" was "a really great day for mammals," including humans, who are here today because of that extinction event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. The survival of birds, a lineage of dinosaurs, highlights the distinction between the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs and the continued existence of avian dinosaurs.

Only 12 people have ever walked on the Moon, all within a four-year span. For the last 50 years, no one has returned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. However, this is set to change. Astronauts will soon return to the Moon to prepare for long-term human habitation and future missions to other planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. To achieve this, they need to be able to survive and work for hours in space, one of the most dangerous environments for humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

The current spacesuits for lunar missions have not been updated in decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. To enable this next chapter in space exploration, spacesuits are undergoing a major upgrade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. These new suits will provide astronauts with enhanced capabilities, allowing them to do more for longer durations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This development is part of a significant transition in how humanity approaches human spaceflight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## The Artemis III Mission

[[History and future of lunar exploration | Lunar exploration]] is poised for a significant step forward with the Artemis III mission. NASA has selected Axiom Space to build the spacesuit for this mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This marks the first time NASA has outsourced the production of its spacesuits to replace their aging and outdated designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

The plan for the Artemis III mission is as follows:
*   **Launch Date**: In 2026, four astronauts will depart Earth aboard one of the most powerful rockets ever built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Lunar Surface Stay**: After a multi-day journey to the Moon, two astronauts will descend to the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. They will spend 6.5 days there, which is twice as long as any previous human lunar stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This will be the first time humans have returned to the Moon since 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Exploration Area**: Astronauts will explore the region near the lunar south pole for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. They hope to discover vital resources like water and metals, which are crucial for establishing a lunar base and facilitating future missions to Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## The Need for Next-Generation Spacesuits

To accomplish the ambitious goals of Artemis III, astronauts require [[design_and_features_of_next_generation_spacesuits | new kinds of spacesuits]] that allow them to stay on the lunar surface longer than ever before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The new suits must provide:
*   **Protection**: Robust protection against extreme heat and cold, especially in permanently shaded regions that receive no sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Mobility**: Greater flexibility and range of motion to perform their tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Fit**: The ability to fit a wider range of body types to enable more people to travel to space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Understanding Spacesuits
Spacesuits are not merely high-tech clothing; they are effectively human-shaped spacecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. Their primary function is to protect astronauts from the deadly [[survival_conditions_and_challenges_in_space | conditions of space]], including:
*   **Lack of Atmosphere**: Providing oxygen and pressure for the body to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
*   **Temperature Extremes**: Shielding from temperatures that can range from 150°C in sunlight to -150°C in shade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Radiation**: Protection from harmful radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Debris**: Guarding against high-velocity flying objects and punctures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

Historically, spacesuits fall into two main categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>:
*   **Launch and Entry Suits**: These (like the orange space shuttle suits or white and black SpaceX suits) act as an atmosphere in case the vehicle loses cabin pressure, allowing for safe re-entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Suits**: Known as the "Extravehicular Mobility Unit" (EMU), these suits enable astronauts to work outside a spacecraft, whether floating in low Earth orbit or walking on the Moon's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

## Axiom Space's Innovations

The [[development_and_testing_of_NASAs_new_spacesuit | new spacesuits]] being developed by Axiom Space are designed to be more sustainable and cost-effective than previous models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Maintainability**: Unlike older suits designed for 14-day missions and refurbishment on Earth, Axiom's suits are built from the ground up to be maintained and repaired in orbit or on mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This reduces long-term spaceflight costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **Cost Reduction**: NASA's 1970s suits reportedly cost around $150 million in today's dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. NASA provided Axiom $228 million for the new model's development, with a plan to decrease the cost per suit as more are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

### Design and Features of the New Suits
Axiom's spacesuits incorporate several advanced features:
*   **Modular Design**: Unlike custom-fitted Apollo suits, Axiom uses small, medium, and large base options, with additional pieces tailored to individual astronauts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. This modular approach aims to fit 90% of men and women in the United States, making space travel accessible to more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
*   **Layered Construction**: A spacesuit consists of several crucial layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>:
    *   **Inner Bladder Layer**: This proprietary material, similar to dishwashing gloves, holds the internal pressure and oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
    *   **Restraint Layer**: This layer, on top of the bladder, prevents the suit from inflating like a balloon and defines how the suit can move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. Astronauts must learn specific movements to operate within these constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
    *   **Insulation Layer**: The outermost layer provides thermal insulation and protection against radiation, dust, and debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. This layer will be white on the Moon to reflect as much light as possible and keep astronauts cool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.
*   **Integrated Cooling**: Astronauts wear liquid cooling garments underneath the suit, with water running through tubes to regulate body temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **Life Support System**: While prototypes use external tubes for oxygen, the final suit will have a "primary life support system" in a backpack to process oxygen and carbon dioxide internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
*   **Specialized Boots**: The boots feature unique proprietary elements to insulate astronauts' feet from the extremely cold lunar surface, especially in permanently shaded regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

### Manufacturing and Testing
Axiom Space's [[development_and_testing_of_NASAs_new_spacesuit | prototype spacesuits]] undergo rigorous testing in their suit test lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, where the lives of astronauts depend on the precision and quality of the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. The manufacturing process for these highly technical suits is largely handmade, requiring extreme precision in stitching and extensive quality control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. While some processes like cutting are automated, the low volume of production means that human precision remains vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.

Astronauts also train in "1G analog suits" or training suits, which help them understand the specific motions they can and cannot perform while wearing a pressurized suit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. For example, lifting an arm requires a very specific path of motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. The suits are pressurized to 4.3 PSI, which creates a sensation similar to diving to the bottom of a pool, requiring astronauts to clear their ears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. An astronaut can spend up to 13 hours in the suit during a real EVA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

## Conclusion

The new spacesuits being developed by Axiom Space represent decades of human engineering achievements, encompassing advances in spaceflight, manufacturing, design, chemistry, textile science, and thermodynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. They are a critical next step in humanity's interplanetary future, enabling extended exploration, sample collection, research, and traverse of the lunar surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. This portable spacecraft, designed to be as small, flexible, and human-shaped as possible, aims to push humanity farther than ever before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>.

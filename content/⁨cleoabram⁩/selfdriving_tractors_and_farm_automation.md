The world is currently experiencing what experts call the [[fourth_agricultural_revolution | Fourth Agricultural Revolution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This pivotal moment in food history is driven by the need to feed a rapidly growing global population, which is projected to reach 9 billion in just 12 years and peak at 10.3 billion by 2084 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. To meet this demand, food output must increase by over 50% by 2050, all while protecting the Earth long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Historical Agricultural Revolutions

To understand the current shift, it's helpful to look at past agricultural transformations:
*   **First Agricultural Revolution** The invention of farming, marking the seed of modern civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Second Agricultural Revolution** Farming became industrialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Third Agricultural Revolution** Between 1950 and 1970, farmers developed new chemicals for pests and weeds, and focused on "monocropping" (one plant per field) to address global hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. While saving lives, monocropping came at a cost, hurting soil over time, causing health problems from pesticides and herbicides, and straining water resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## Five Steps to Feed the World

Experts propose a five-step solution to feed an additional 2 billion people and solve the problems created by previous solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Step One: Freeze Land Use
Humans have already cleared an area the size of South America for agriculture. Therefore, nearly all new food for the growing population must come from existing land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### Step Two: Grow More on Existing Land
One controversial but crucial option is to use robots to farm faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Farm robots can increase farming speed, operate in various weather conditions, and work at different times of day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This is complex due to concerns about farm labor jobs, but also addresses shortages in certain farm labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Robots are already accomplishing tasks previously thought impossible, like picking soft fruits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

To feed billions more people, large agricultural machines are becoming smarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

#### Self-Driving Tractors
The process of growing food involves tilling soil, planting seeds, nurturing plants, and harvesting crops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Modern tractors can drive themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
Although [[current_state_of_selfdriving_cars | self-driving]] tractors have existed for a while, the technology is improving and becoming easier to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. A single farmer could potentially run multiple "Farm Roombas" using a phone, creating detailed routes with precise GPS to cover every part of a field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. GPS technology allows positioning accuracy to within 1 inch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

This technology enables [[precision_agriculture_and_technology | precision agriculture]], where AI and ultra-precise GPS generate efficient field path plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. This increases food output by reducing "dead spots" (missed areas) and "overlap" (areas hit twice, overusing resources) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Self-driving tractors use cameras and sensors to avoid humans and obstacles, optimizing routes and maximizing output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

#### High-Speed Planters
Once the field is tilled, high-speed planters are used to get seeds into the ground. These machines can plant at roughly 10 mph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. They precisely control seed placement, ensuring optimal distance between plants to prevent competition for resources and correct depth for moisture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. This precision can increase crop yield by up to 20% if every seed becomes a plant and emerges simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. The machines use a system of hoses, vacuums, sensors, and cameras to scan, drop, and record seeds within a fraction of a second across thousands of seeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### Step Three: Use Resources More Wisely
This involves nurturing crops by applying fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides more efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **"See and Spray" Technology**: Machines like the 18-ton, 120-foot-wide "See and Spray" use computer vision and machine learning with Nvidia GPUs to identify weeds versus crops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. They can spray a tiny squirt of herbicide only on the identified weeds, dramatically reducing chemical use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Even at speeds of 15 mph, cameras can identify and spray weeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   **Laser Weeders**: Some machines completely eliminate chemicals by using lasers to burn weeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   **Physical Force**: Other options involve using visual recognition systems and physical force to destroy weeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

This [[precision_agriculture_and_technology | precision agriculture]] can broadly help use fewer chemicals, less fertilizer, and less water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. It could also enable the return of "intercropping," an older farming method that keeps soil healthy by planting different kinds of plants in the same field, a practice challenging with traditional monocropping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

### Step Four: Shift Our Diets
Only 55% of the world's crop calories feed people directly; the rest feed livestock, which is less efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

### Step Five: Cut Down on Food Waste
Roughly 25% of the world's total food calories are lost or wasted before consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Outlook

While [[technological_advancements_and_global_competition_in_ai | technology]] is crucial for the [[fourth_agricultural_revolution | Fourth Agricultural Revolution]], it brings significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. As reliance on technology increases, questions arise about job changes and existing job structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. Farmers advocate for the "right to repair," seeking the freedom to repair and maintain their equipment independently, similar to ongoing discussions in other industries like cars and phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. Overcoming these challenges is essential to successfully feed an estimated 10 billion people globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

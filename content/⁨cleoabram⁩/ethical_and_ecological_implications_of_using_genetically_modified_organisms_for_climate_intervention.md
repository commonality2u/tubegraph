Researchers are utilizing [[genetic_engineering_in_trees_to_capture_more_co2 | genetic engineering]] to combat [[the_potential_role_of_genetically_modified_trees_in_combating_climate_change | climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This involves creating "supertrees" designed to capture more carbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The overarching idea behind this work is that humanity will soon need to take on the responsibility of deliberately and continuously regulating the atmosphere of the planet for all living things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. A key question arises: how much should other species be changed to achieve this goal? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Genetic Engineering for Enhanced Carbon Capture

Genetic engineering has enabled the manipulation of living things, including crops, animals, and even humans, over the past few decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. In the context of trees, the goal is to make the photosynthesis process more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### The Mechanism: Targeting Rubisco
Trees absorb carbon dioxide, sunlight, and water to produce oxygen and sugars through photosynthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. A crucial enzyme in photosynthesis, called "rubisco," sometimes picks up oxygen instead of carbon dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This leads to "photorespiration," a process that wastes energy and releases carbon dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. By altering the expression of genes controlling this process, researchers aim to reduce photorespiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### The "Gene Gun"
A tool known as a "gene gun" is used for this genetic alteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This device coats gold particles with DNA fragments and then shoots these particles into plant cells, allowing for the incorporation of new genes into the plant cell's genome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This method is considered popular from a regulatory perspective because it does not introduce any non-plant pest genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

### Early Results
Early results indicate that some genetically engineered seedlings show enhanced photosynthesis and a higher rate of carbon assimilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This suggests that it is possible to meaningfully increase the amount of carbon some trees extract from the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

## Rationale and Scale of Intervention

A primary question regarding [[the_potential_role_of_genetically_modified_trees_in_combating_climate_change | genetically modified trees]] is why modify trees instead of simply planting more of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
The current estimate suggests that a trillion trees would need to be planted to account for anthropogenic human carbon emissions if their carbon drawdown ability isn't increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Enhancing the trees could reduce this number to slightly over 500 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. A small change in an individual organism can significantly magnify when applied to a larger number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

## Ecological Considerations

The practice of mass tree planting, even with un-altered trees, has become controversial due to ecological concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### The Carbon Cycle: Fast vs. Slow
When trees absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis, they reduce atmospheric carbon around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. However, much of this carbon is released back into the atmosphere within a year or a few years when leaves fall or the trees decompose; this is the "fast" carbon cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Burning fossil fuels, conversely, releases CO2 from the "slow" carbon cycle—biomass trapped underground for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Therefore, planting trees that only engage in the fast carbon cycle isn't enough; efforts are needed to make them contribute more to long-term carbon sequestration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Trees that trap more carbon could be helpful if that carbon is then trapped themselves over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

### Concerns about Invasive Species
A common concern with [[potential_genetic_enhancements_and_their_implications | genetic engineering]] for plants in the wild is the risk of creating invasive species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. To address this, the approach is not to plant a single genetically engineered species at scale universally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Instead, the focus is on enhancing native species, such as loblolly pine in Southeastern Georgia and longleaf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Planting non-native trees, even if they grow quickly, can worsen the carbon problem by disrupting the delicate balance of local ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. The goal is to provide an example of how scientists can enhance photosynthesis in plants native to their specific environments, inspiring local groups globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Researchers are sharing their findings publicly to encourage more companies to work on climate change and carbon removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### Growth Rate vs. Final Size
Genetically engineered seedlings show faster biomass accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. However, there is no evidence yet that this will result in a larger final adult tree size; it simply means the tree reaches its mature size more quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

## Future Vision and Societal Implications

The company Living Carbon is moving towards commercial tree-planting operations, with a capacity to plant over 10 million trees by the end of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This represents the first commercial planting of a photosynthesis-enhanced organism in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

The broader vision is that humanity will need to become the species that regulates the atmosphere's composition for the entire biosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Humans are not the first species to destabilize the atmosphere; for example, the evolution of algae produced oxygen, causing a mass extinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. This future scenario might involve a "Subcommittee for Survival," a "Ministry for the Continuation of Life on Earth," or a "United Atmospheric Supervision Force" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Such a responsibility would be unprecedented for any known species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. The hope is that while humans may not be the first species to destabilize the atmosphere, they could be the last <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

[[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | Fracking]], or hydraulic fracturing, is a method used by energy companies to extract oil and natural gas from underground rock formations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This process involves drilling into rock and pumping fluid at high pressure to crack it open, allowing trapped oil and natural gas to escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. While it has enabled significant [[energy_independence_and_reduced_reliance_on_foreign_oil | energy independence]] for the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>, it also carries substantial environmental costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

## Climate Change Contribution
A primary concern with [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]] is its contribution to climate change. The process makes it possible to extract and burn much more oil and natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>, which are fossil fuels. The use of fossil fuels is a major driver of climate change, leading to observable impacts such as increased fires, extreme weather events, and droughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

## Groundwater Contamination
Another significant concern associated with [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]] is the pollution of groundwater.
*   **Chemicals in Fluid:** The fluid used to crack rock contains chemicals that are effective for extraction but harmful to people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. The extent and exact manner in which these chemicals enter people's water remain controversial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
*   **Surface Accidents:** Reports indicate that accidents on the surface, particularly involving leftover fluids that return to the surface after [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]], can pollute drinking water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
*   **Pipe Cracks:** While cracks in the pipes extending underground could pose a problem, reports suggest this is not an issue if operations are carried out correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has linked the oil and gas drilling method to the pollution of groundwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

## Induced Seismic Activity
[[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | Fracking]] has also raised concerns about causing a rise in earthquakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. While it might seem that the act of busting up rock underground is the main cause, the primary problem leading to seismic activity is actually the disposal of the nasty leftover fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. This fluid is sometimes injected back into the ground for disposal, which can cause significant issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

> "In oil and gas, we have seen earthquakes primarily in the US in two locations, and that was not related to hydraulic fracturing. Most of these were related to a wastewater injection in the basement rock.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>

Injecting wastewater back into the ground is considered the best alternative for disposal, as keeping it on the surface would be far more environmentally problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.

## Future Implications and Alternative Applications
Despite these significant environmental concerns, the technology perfected for [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]] fossil fuels is also being explored for its potential in [[enhanced_geothermal_technology_using_fracking_techniques | enhanced geothermal]] energy, a clean and almost limitless renewable source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. This new application uses similar techniques to create reservoirs in hot rock to heat water, with the key difference being that the fluids injected are usually water or close to water, making them environmentally benign compared to the chemicals used in fossil fuel [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. While the earthquake concern still applies, the science has advanced to make that risk very tiny in modern applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the debate around [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]] involves weighing its established environmental harms and potential for more against the need for reliable energy sources. While focusing on closed-loop systems or other [[misconceptions_about_clean_energy | clean energy]] sources like wind and solar are options, the potential for [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]] techniques to unlock more [[misconceptions_about_clean_energy | clean energy]] from geothermal sources presents an opportunity for the technology to contribute to solving climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>.

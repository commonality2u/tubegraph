Nuclear power plants, at the end of their fuel cycle, produce what is commonly known as "nuclear waste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This waste is often imagined as "glowing green goo in yellow barrels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, a highly radioactive material that requires storage for hundreds of thousands of years due to its danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Concerns about the storage and existence of this waste frequently lead to debates about the viability of nuclear energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

However, historical records and current research suggest that nuclear waste is not merely dangerous trash, but potentially an "incredible clean energy resource" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Historical Context: Early Innovations

As early as 1962, a nuclear reactor was developed by [[Argonne National Laboratory | Argonne National Laboratory]] that could make electricity directly from nuclear waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This technology led to predictions that "by the year 2000 more than half the electric power of the country will come from atomic sources" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Despite these early advancements and optimistic forecasts for a [[clean_energy_future | clean energy]] future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, the United States today does not reuse any of its nuclear waste; instead, it continues to pile up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## The Untapped Potential of Used Nuclear Fuel

A visit to [[Argonne National Laboratory | Argonne National Laboratory]] revealed that the same lab developed the historic [[nuclear_waste_as_energy | nuclear waste recycling]] reactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Discussions with representatives from Oklo, a company developing new types of nuclear reactors, uncovered a startling fact: there is "enough used fuel [nuclear waste] to power the country for the next 150 years" just from existing stockpiles in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. While experts may differ on the exact number of years, there is broad agreement that the nuclear waste currently possessed could serve as a substantial energy source using existing technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### Beyond Energy: Waste Reduction Benefits

Recycling nuclear waste offers more than just energy production; it can also dramatically reduce the time it remains radioactive. Reusing the waste, especially multiple times, can decrease the hazardous period from hundreds of thousands of years to just hundreds of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. This significantly simplifies the challenge of long-term storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. The primary hurdles are cost and global politics, rather than fundamental technological limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## The Science of Nuclear Waste Recycling

The core of nuclear power production involves heating a liquid into steam to spin a turbine, generating electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. In nuclear reactors, this heat is produced by splitting atoms inside special rocks, primarily uranium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

Only a small fraction (less than 1%) of natural uranium is the "breakable" kind, Uranium-235 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. This is typically enriched from Uranium-238 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Fuel pellets, about the size of a finger joint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, are placed into metal rods. Neutrons are fired at Uranium-235, causing it to split into unstable atoms and release more neutrons, initiating a chain reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This fission process converts a small amount of mass into energy, making the rods hot, heating water, spinning turbines, and generating electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

After four to six years, the fuel becomes "spent" as the special uranium is depleted, making the reaction inefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. This spent fuel is classified as high-level nuclear waste, containing leftover Uranium-235 and Uranium-238, plus unstable atoms that emit ionizing radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. This radiation can be deadly in large doses and remains potent for "hundreds of thousands of years sometimes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

### Current Storage and the "Once-Through" Fuel Cycle

Currently, most nuclear waste in the United States is stored in dry casks designed to last decades, not hundreds of thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. This practice of mining uranium, using it once, and then storing it indefinitely is known as the "once-through" fuel cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Critics, even in the 1960s, likened this to "using the cream and throwing away the milk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

### The Recycling Process: A "Closed" Fuel Cycle

[[Argonne National Laboratory | Argonne National Laboratory]] continues to test nuclear waste recycling in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. The process involves:
1.  Cutting nuclear waste into small pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
2.  Dissolving these pieces in molten salts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
3.  Running electricity through the vat to separate useful uranium and other materials from the rest of the junk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
4.  Collecting deposits of the useful material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
5.  Creating new fuel rods from these deposits for reuse in a reactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

This "closed" fuel cycle involves mining uranium, using it in a reactor, filtering out useful components, and reusing them multiple times before storing the remaining waste for a much shorter, more manageable period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Some countries, like Japan, already implement variations of this process to reduce reliance on imported fuel, conserve uranium, and minimize waste radioactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

## Why the US Stopped and What's Changing

In 1977, President Jimmy Carter announced new policies halting all [[nuclear_waste_as_energy | nuclear recycling]] in the US, citing concerns about nuclear proliferation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. A key material separated during recycling, plutonium, was deemed a high concern for nuclear weapons development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. The US then shifted away from "fast reactors" (which could handle nuclear waste) to "light water reactors" (which couldn't) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

While the US ceased recycling, other countries continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. President Reagan lifted the ban in 1981, as the ban was no longer seen as effective in slowing proliferation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. However, companies had already invested in reactors that couldn't recycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

Today, the main argument against nuclear fuel recycling is its perceived high cost and lack of economic viability compared to cheap and plentiful new uranium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. However, incentives are shifting. The need for more [[clean_energy_future | clean energy]] and concerns about global conflict impacting fuel supply are renewing interest in this previously abandoned technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. This technology has been demonstrated and proven before; the challenge now is to commercialize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

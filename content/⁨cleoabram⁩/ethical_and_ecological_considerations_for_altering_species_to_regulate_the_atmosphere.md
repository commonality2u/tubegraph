Humanity is facing a man-made disaster of global scale, driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions [00:00:22]. In response, researchers are exploring [[genetic_engineering_for_enhanced_carbon_capture_in_trees | genetic engineering to help slow climate change]] [00:00:35]. This involves creating "supertrees" designed to capture more carbon [00:00:03]. This approach, however, raises significant [[ethical_debates_and_societal_implications | ethical debates and societal implications]] [00:01:32] and ecological considerations.

## The Promise of Supertrees

A genetically engineered tree can capture more carbon than its unaltered counterparts [00:00:03]. The goal is to strengthen one of humanity's best allies in the fight against climate change [00:00:44].

### How Genetic Engineering Enhances Carbon Capture
Genetic engineering has given scientists the power to manipulate living things, including crops, animals, and even humans, over the past few decades [00:00:11]. The process of photosynthesis, where trees take in carbon dioxide, sunlight, and water to produce oxygen and sugars, is central to carbon capture [00:02:30]. To get a tree to capture more carbon, the aim is to make this process happen more efficiently [00:02:39].

One key part of photosynthesis is an enzyme called "rubisco" [00:02:45]. Rubisco sometimes picks up oxygen instead of CO2, leading to "photorespiration," which wastes energy and releases carbon dioxide [00:02:50]. Scientists can alter the expression of genes that control this process [00:03:02].

A tool called a "gene gun" is used for this alteration [00:03:07]. This device coats gold particles with DNA fragments and shoots them into plant cells, incorporating new genes into the plant's genome [00:03:12]. This method is popular from a regulatory perspective because it doesn't introduce non-plant pest genes [00:03:38].

Early results suggest that some genetically engineered seedlings show enhanced photosynthesis and a higher rate of carbon assimilation, indicating it's possible to meaningfully increase how much carbon trees absorb [00:03:56].

### Why Alter Trees Instead of Just Planting More?
While planting more trees is a step in the right direction, it has limitations [00:00:57]. If humanity only plants more trees without enhancing their carbon drawdown ability, an estimated trillion trees would be needed to account for anthropogenic carbon emissions [00:04:42]. Genetically enhancing trees could potentially reduce this number to slightly above 500 billion, representing a significant reduction in the scale of planting required [00:04:58]. A small change in one organism can magnify significantly when spread across a larger number [00:05:14].

## Ecological Considerations

While the potential benefits are clear, there are important [[ethical_considerations_of_genome_editing | ethical considerations of genome editing]] and ecological concerns.

### The Carbon Cycle: Fast vs. Slow
Trees absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis, reducing atmospheric CO2 [00:05:42]. However, when leaves fall or trees die and decompose, much of that carbon is released back into the atmosphere within a short period (the "fast" carbon cycle) [00:05:49]. This is why graphs of carbon dioxide concentrations show a yearly zigzag, as plants take in and release carbon [00:06:04].

In contrast, burning fossil fuels releases CO2 from the "slow" carbon cycle—compressed biomass trapped deep underground or in the ocean for centuries [00:06:13]. Therefore, it's crucial that efforts to plant trees also contribute to trapping more carbon in the long term, potentially through enhanced decay processes [00:06:30].

### Addressing the Invasive Species Concern
A common concern with genetically engineered plants intended for the wild is the risk of them becoming invasive species [00:06:51]. However, the companies developing these supertrees aim to enhance photosynthesis in plants native to their specific environments, rather than introducing new species [00:07:01]. For example, loblolly pine and longleaf pine are native to Southeastern Georgia, where they are being worked on [00:07:11]. Planting non-native trees, even fast-growing ones, can worsen the carbon problem by disrupting the delicate balance of local ecosystems [00:07:20]. The goal is to inspire others to enhance native plants worldwide [00:07:40].

## The Broader Vision: Regulating the Atmosphere

The development of genetically engineered trees is part of a much larger idea: humanity taking on the responsibility to deliberately and continuously regulate the atmosphere of the planet for all living things [00:01:15]. This responsibility is unprecedented for any species [00:01:20].

Humans are not the first species to destabilize the atmosphere; for instance, when algae first evolved, their oxygen production caused a mass extinction [00:10:03]. The current efforts represent a recognition that in the future, it will be necessary for humans to regulate the atmosphere's composition for the biosphere [00:10:13]. This raises the question of how much other species should be changed to achieve this [00:01:34].

The first commercial planting of a photosynthesis-enhanced tree at commercial scale occurred in 2023 [00:09:34]. This marks a beginning, not a complete solution, to [[role_of_supertrees_in_climate_change_mitigation | climate change mitigation]] [00:09:48]. It highlights the growing challenge and opportunity in [[future_implications_and_challenges_of_genetic_modification | future implications and challenges of genetic modification]] for global environmental management.

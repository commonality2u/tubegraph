The Higgs Boson, also known as the "God Particle," is a mystery particle that was predicted to exist near the beginning of our universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. Its detection was considered of "vital importance to universal existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>.

## The Standard Model and the Mystery of Mass
The existence of the Higgs Boson was predicted by [[particle_physics_and_the_standard_model | The Standard Model]], a mathematical description of how humans believe the world works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>. This model helps understand "where we came from, where we're going, what we're made of" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.

The Higgs Boson was crucial because its detection would confirm an underlying field responsible for giving other particles mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>. This means it would help scientists understand "why stuff exists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. The underlying field was the best mathematical explanation for this fundamental mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

## The Role of the Large Hadron Collider
To detect the Higgs Boson, enough energy needed to be concentrated in one place to create it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>. This was a primary reason for building the [[cern_and_the_large_hadron_collider | Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.

The [[cern_and_the_large_hadron_collider | LHC]], located on the border between France and Switzerland, is the largest science experiment ever built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It's a 27 km long tunnel, over 100 meters underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Inside, two pipes are kept colder and emptier than outer space, where particles smaller than atoms are fired in opposite directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. These particles, specifically protons, are pushed to nearly the speed of light before they collide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

The collision process involves:
*   Firing 100 billion protons in bunches in each direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.
*   On average, about 50 or 60 collisions occur per crossing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.
*   This process is repeated 30 million times per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

These collisions release an enormous amount of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. A key principle of [[particle_physics_and_the_standard_model | particle physics]] states that energy and mass are related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>, meaning that high enough energy from these collisions can turn into physical mass, potentially creating mysterious or unknown particles – more of the universe's building blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>. The Higgs Boson was one such predicted mystery particle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.

Scientists at [[cern_and_the_large_hadron_collider | CERN]] then analyze the "crime scene" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>, working backward to reverse-engineer what happened at the moment of collision and identify what mystery particles might have been present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>.

## The Confirmation
After building the [[cern_and_the_large_hadron_collider | LHC]], thousands of scientists spent two more years collecting data at two different detectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>. Finally, they announced that they had reliably created the Higgs Boson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.

The proof of its existence was a "bump on a chart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. Scientists had mathematically predicted that if the Higgs Boson existed, such a bump – indicating more particles being produced at a specific energy – would appear when particles were smashed together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>. The appearance of this bump confirmed that the math was right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.

## Significance and Future Impact
The confirmation of the Higgs Boson's existence did not immediately change the world for everyday people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>. However, it demonstrated that humanity is "on the right track" in understanding the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>.

Discovering these fundamental building blocks of reality, like the Higgs Boson, is essential for future advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>. Just as Sir Isaac Newton could not have foreseen humans on the moon after revealing the motion of planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>, the full impact of today's discoveries will be realized by future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. A better understanding of how these particles work could lead to new technologies that change lives in 20, 30, or 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>.

The [[cern_and_the_large_hadron_collider | Large Hadron Collider]] has also shaped our understanding of how elementary particles interact and combine, continuously testing theories about the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>. The pure science conducted at [[advancements_and_applications_from_cern_research | CERN]] has already resulted in numerous applications, including:
*   New therapies for cancer treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>
*   Better medical imaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>
*   More efficient electric cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>
*   More sensitive radiation detectors used in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>
*   The development of the World Wide Web, initially a way for scientists to communicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>

While some scientists believe the current collider might have reached its learning limits, and a bigger one like the proposed [[future_circular_collider_and_its_potential_impact | Future Circular Collider]] may be needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>, the pursuit of fundamental research remains crucial. It lays the groundwork for all applied research, akin to elementary schooling for higher education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42:00">[14:42:00]</a>.

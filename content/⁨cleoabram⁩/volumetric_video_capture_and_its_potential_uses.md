Volumetric video capture is an advanced technology that creates real-time, three-dimensional holograms of subjects by surrounding them with cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. This method allows users to move themselves and the virtual camera anywhere within the captured 3D space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

## How it Works
Unlike [[motion_capture_and_its_application_in_modern_filmmaking | motion capture]], volumetric video does not require the subject to wear a special suit or undergo a prior scan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. As soon as someone steps into the designated capture volume, they are immediately transformed into a 3D hologram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. For a demonstration, six cameras were used to capture the volumetric video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. The resulting camera angle viewed is not a real physical camera angle but a stitch of the six different camera feeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

## Applications and Future Potential
Marques Brownlee highlighted the transformative potential of volumetric video for content creation, particularly in the realm of online video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>:

> "This is one of those things where like people have asked, 'Marques what is the future of video?' and to me I've always been trying to make videos as realistic as possible which is like first person view, wide angle, you see the device in your hands and it almost feels like a natural feature of that is like putting the device in your hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

He compared it to 360-degree video, which allows viewers to look around a sphere but not "look to the side and like check underneath" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Volumetric video, however, adds an "added dimension of that interactivity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. This technology could enable new forms of [[future_of_video_content_creation_and_accessibility | video content creation and accessibility]], allowing creators to tell stories previously thought impossible due to budget or technical constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

One playful example of its potential is the idea of "beaming in and out of places" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>, hinting at capabilities related to [[digital_teleportation_and_the_future_of_virtual_presence | digital teleportation]] or enhanced virtual presence. Marques even humorously suggested that Cleo could choreograph an entire MKBHD video using this technology without him needing to "lift a finger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. The advancements in video tech, including volumetric capture, signify a future where "more people's creativity" will be accessible, enabling creators to "do so much more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

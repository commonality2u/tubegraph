The current era has been dubbed the "ultimate election year," with countries representing half of the world's population preparing to vote for their leaders, marking a significant test for democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This massive undertaking requires millions of polling places and billions of ballots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. While voting can be challenging due to travel, long lines, or work schedules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, the idea of online voting often emerges as a potential solution for greater convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

However, the question of "Why can't I vote online?" reveals a highly controversial, complicated, and high-stakes answer, according to voting and [[security_concerns_in_online_voting | security experts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Concerns about systems being "vulnerable to cyber attacks" and "simply not secure enough" are prominent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Current Landscape of Online Voting

Online voting has surprising origins, with one of the first instances occurring in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. In 1997, Texas enabled an astronaut to vote from the Mir Space Station, a tradition that continues with American astronauts on the ISS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

Currently, several US states offer online voting options primarily for military and overseas citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Approximately 300,000 Americans voted online in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Globally, many countries also provide online voting options to varying degrees, but these are mostly limited to individuals with special circumstances, rather than being universally available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Traditional Voting Methods

In contrast, most of the world still relies on traditional in-person voting methods:
*   **India**: As the world's largest democracy, voters go to polling stations and use electronic machines, with their fingers inked to prevent fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Gambia**: Voters place marbles into colored drums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **United States**: Many voters mark paper ballots, which are then counted by optical scan ballot counters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The physical paper ballot is crucial as a backup for audits or recounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

Official election results can take weeks to finalize as ballots are fully counted and audited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Despite the efforts, only about two-thirds of eligible US citizens typically vote, a lower rate compared to other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## The Promise and Peril of Online Voting

The primary aspiration for online voting is to increase voter turnout and make participation in democracies easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. However, this is only viable "if and only if we can do it safely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

The stakes for online voting are exceptionally high, given that it concerns how "the most important well-armed countries in the world" choose their leaders and attempt to influence their adversaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This involves [[the_role_of_cybersecurity_in_voting | cybersecurity]] on an entirely different level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Experts caution against using current methods like emailing or faxing ballots for an entire country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## [[challenges_of_online_voting | Challenges of Online Voting]]

Cybersecurity experts Dr. Joe Kiniry and Dr. Josh Benaloh highlight four basic [[challenges_of_online_voting | challenges to voting online]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>:

### 1. Credentials
Online voting requires reliable "digital credentials" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Estonia** provides every citizen with an electronic ID card used for various services, including online voting since the early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **United States**: There has been strong resistance to a national ID system, and while Social Security numbers exist, their expansion into a national ID is a "no go" from a [[political_and_technical_barriers_to_online_voting | political standpoint]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

### 2. Coercion
This challenge involves both technical and [[political_and_technical_barriers_to_online_voting | political barriers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Online voting makes it easier for someone to be coerced into voting a certain way, as a device could be handed over after authentication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. The secret ballot is crucial to prevent vote selling, buying, and manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Estonia's solution**: Voters can recast their vote online multiple times, with only the last recorded vote being counted, allowing individuals to revote if coerced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   Unlike online banking, where transactions are part of a public ledger visible to both the user and the bank, voting requires absolute secrecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### 3. Client Malware
[[security_concerns_in_online_voting | Client malware]] poses a significant threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. If internet voting is implemented, every voter's device becomes part of the election's infrastructure, vastly expanding the "attack surface" for hackers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. The main concern is "vote flipping," where malware changes a voter's selection without their knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

Online voting is different from other secure online activities like banking because of the inability to confirm that actions have been done properly due to the secret ballot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

*   **The Benaloh Challenge**: Invented by Josh Benaloh, this method allows voters to mathematically prove the system is working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Voters can choose to "check" their encrypted vote (e.g., by revealing if it's red or black in a card analogy) or "keep" it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. By checking enough times, a voter can gain confidence in the system's integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Statistically, if even 1% of 100 million voters perform a check, a small number of flipped votes (e.g., 100) would likely be caught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   However, if finding a problem on a phone could call an election into question, it could lead to deliberate acts of voters introducing malware to upset results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

### 4. Denial of Service Attacks
This is potentially the highest-stakes challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. The goal is to overload a system with fake traffic, causing websites to crash or internet outages in specific areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Even a slowdown for a few hours could be catastrophic, akin to creating "online weather" to influence turnout in specific locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

The adversaries behind such attacks are "extremely talented," possessing "unbounded amounts of hackers, computers, networks, and cash," focusing on influencing national elections rather than typical email scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

## Conclusion

Beyond the technical hurdles, a significant [[Public perceptions of global issues | public trust]] problem exists, which is not solely a technological issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. While progress is being made on online voting, "unsolved problems" and inherent difficulties remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. The future might hold a viable online voting system, but for now, the act of voting itself, a right many fought for, remains a human endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

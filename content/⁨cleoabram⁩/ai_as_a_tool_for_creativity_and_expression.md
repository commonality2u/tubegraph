AI is rapidly transforming the music landscape, offering new avenues for [[the_creative_potential_unlocked_by_ai_tools | creativity and expression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. This new technology is viewed as a powerful tool that can help bridge "the gap" between an artist's idea and their ability to realize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

## Shrinking the Creativity Gap
The "gap" refers to the difference between a perfect idea in one's head and what can realistically be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. Often, individuals may shrink their ideas to fit the available tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. AI's potential lies in reducing the technical skill required to express creativity, a historical trend that has led to more great music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

Historically, creating compositions required musical genius like Mozart or Beethoven, with significant costs associated with testing ideas with an orchestra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. Modern tools, like the computer for artists such as Avicii, have already lowered this barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. AI is seen as the next evolution of this, a very powerful new tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

## Current Applications in Music
AI is enabling the creation of entirely new songs through fake collaborations, or by generating lyrics and melodies in seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. Background music can even be created by typing in a few words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

Examples of AI-generated music include:
*   Frank Sinatra's voice singing Lil Jon's "Get Low" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   Linkin Park singing the "Pokemon Song" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   Johnny Cash singing "Barbie Girl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

Specific AI tools for artists include:
*   **ChatGPT**: Used to generate lyrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
*   **Google's MusicLM**: Used to create new melodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. These may already be present on platforms like Spotify without listeners knowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
*   **Elf Tech (by Grimes)**: Allows users to change their voice into Grimes' voice for new songs and recordings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>.

## Artist Perspectives on AI Tools
Artists hold differing views on the appropriate use of AI.

### Grimes
Grimes has publicly supported the use of AI, particularly voice cloning, becoming one of the first artists to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. She teaches people how to use her Elf Tech tool for voice transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. On Spotify, there is a verified "human Grimes" and a "collaborator" profile for those using her voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. She plans to release a competitive AI album alongside her own album <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

However, Grimes believes that AI should not write lyrics or automatically generate music, as she thinks this might not be good for the human mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

### Spotify CEO Daniel Ek
Daniel Ek, CEO of Spotify, views AI as a natural progression of [[technological_advances_enabling_ai_capabilities | technological advances]] that democratize music creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. He doesn't believe Spotify would necessarily know what tools artists use to create their music, as they receive audio files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. Ek highlights that musicians have always learned from past artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>. He emphasizes that the output of AI training should be new intellectual property (IP), not something that "drafts off someone else's name and likeness" or is "confusingly similar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>.

## Broader Implications for Expression
The potential for AI to aid human expression is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. While concerns exist about [[the_ethical_and_economic_implications_of_aigenerated_art | compensation for musicians]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>, AI can be a tool to foster more connections through music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>. The belief is that many people who may not realize they have musical talent could discover it through this technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>. This could unlock a vast amount of human expression currently "locked inside people's minds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>.

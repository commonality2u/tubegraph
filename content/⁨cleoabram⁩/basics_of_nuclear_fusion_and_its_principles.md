[[basics_of_nuclear_fusion | Nuclear fusion]] is a process where two particles are forced together at very high energies, causing them to fuse and form a heavier particle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This process requires high energies, typically achieved through high voltage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Methods of Confinement

To achieve [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion | fusion]], plasma must be confined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Different methods are used for this:

*   **Gravitational Confinement** The Sun uses gravity to confine plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Magnetic Confinement** This method uses magnets to confine plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Examples include stellarators, which have "twisty turny" vacuum chambers, and tokamaks, which have a "d-shaped cross section" like a donut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Helion's devices are cylindrical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Inertial Confinement** This broadly involves pushing plasma together. One type uses lasers to bring plasma close enough for fusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### Electrostatic Inertial Confinement

The [[building_a_farnsworth_fusor_for_nuclear_fusion | Farnsworth fusor]], a compact device for achieving some amount of [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion | fusion]], uses "electrostatic inertial confinement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. In this method, ions stream from all angles into a spherical central core where they collide and fuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## Fusion Reaction Example: Deuterium to Helium-4

A common [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion | fusion]] reaction involves taking two deuteriums (each a neutron and a proton) and fusing them together to form helium-4 (two protons and two neutrons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This larger molecule is "really hot," and that heat is the energy extracted from the particle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Energy Production and [[challenges_in_nuclear_fusion_energy_production | Challenges]]

Each [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion | fusion]] reaction produces tremendously more energy than it took to fuse the particles together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. However, a significant [[challenges_in_nuclear_fusion_energy_production | challenge]] in [[using_nuclear_fusion_as_an_energy_source | using nuclear fusion as an energy source]] is producing enough energy to counteract the energy spent on the electronics and systems required to make the reaction happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. While an enormous amount of energy can be obtained from the atomic reaction itself, generating more total electricity from the overall system remains a hurdle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Detecting Fusion

When [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion | fusion]] occurs within a plasma, it generates light. Deuterium plasma, for instance, appears "pink" or fuchsia because the eye perceives combined blue and bright red photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Scientists also monitor temperature and particle energy levels to confirm that [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion | fusion]] is taking place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## Current State and [[commercial_applications_and_future_of_nuclear_fusion | Future Outlook]]

While devices like the [[building_a_farnsworth_fusor_for_nuclear_fusion | Farnsworth fusor]] can achieve [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion | fusion]] on a small scale, they are not suitable for [[commercial_applications_and_future_of_nuclear_fusion | commercial electricity systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. [[commercial_applications_and_future_of_nuclear_fusion | Commercial systems]] will be larger and more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. However, the rate of technological progress in [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion | nuclear fusion]] is significant, with private companies and government projects now building systems capable of achieving commercial levels of [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion | fusion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. The goal is to get these systems on the grid as quickly as possible, with predictions suggesting that [[using_nuclear_fusion_as_an_energy_source | fusion electricity]] could be available within our lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

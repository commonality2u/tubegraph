Initially, there was skepticism about the immediate future of [[current_state_of_selfdriving_cars | self-driving cars]], with predictions often feeling like "bullshit" and the technology always seeming "a few years away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. However, recent developments indicate that driverless taxis are now operational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Dozens of people in San Francisco are already requesting rides and finding no one inside the arriving vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Current State and Operational Context

The advent of self-driving technology is not a binary switch, but rather a gradual evolution over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This journey has been categorized into [[levels_of_automation_in_selfdriving_technology | levels of self-driving-ness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>:
*   **Level 0:** Momentary help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **Level 1:** More continuous support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Level 2:** Newer systems like highway piloting, where humans are still largely in charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

Urban self-driving taxis, or robotaxis, operate at a higher level, fitting into a category where the car is "fully in charge, but only in certain situations or areas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This is often referred to as Level 4, or "full self-driving but within constraints" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. These vehicles are trained for complex urban areas but are geographically constrained, meaning they cannot simply be dropped into a new city without prior training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## The Urban Robotaxi Vision: Cruise

One of the leading companies in the urban robotaxi space is Cruise, whose CEO, Kyle, was observed taking his first driverless ride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Cruise represents the vision of self-driving cars operating in complex urban environments and carrying people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This approach contrasts with others focusing on less complex situations (like highways) or not carrying people (such as [[future_of_autonomous_trucking_and_delivery_robots | autonomous trucking]] or delivery robots) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

## Challenges and Nuances

As this technology meets the real world, "sometimes it's a little bit bumpy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Companies like Cruise are learning the "weird nuances between humans and machines that we take for granted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

Notable challenges include:
*   **Sleeping Passengers:** Passengers occasionally fall asleep in the back of the robotaxi. The car will wait, and if the person doesn't exit quickly, customer support intervenes via audio to check on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Interactions with Authorities:** A viral incident showed a driverless Cruise car being pulled over by police <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. The car initially pulled over but then drove across an intersection to find a safer place to stop when the officer walked away and turned off sirens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This highlighted the need for the vehicle's complex system of audio and visual detection for sirens and flashing lights to seamlessly interact with human unpredictability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## Future Developments in Robotaxis

Cruise is developing its "Origin" model, which fundamentally differs from traditional cars by removing components like the steering wheel and brake pedals, as they are no longer necessary for a driverless vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Passengers in current Cruise vehicles are already unable to take control, being separated by plexiglass, because human interference would likely worsen the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

## Societal Impact

The [[impact_of_selfdriving_cars_on_society_and_transportation | impact of self-driving cars on society and transportation]] is expected to be profound. In the longer term, people might view human driving as "barbaric," given the risks associated with putting human teenagers behind the wheel of "huge death machines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Beyond safety, robotaxis promise to return significant time to individuals, potentially an hour or more daily, which is seen as a "profound" benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The future of self-driving is being made in this "messy, messy middle" of current development and real-world application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

In the 1970s, physicist Stephen Hawking made a groundbreaking discovery that challenged previous understandings of black holes: they are not entirely black. His calculations showed that black holes emit radiation, now known as [[Hawking Radiation and Information Paradox|Hawking radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>. This phenomenon implies that black holes have a finite lifetime and will eventually evaporate, turning into the normal vacuum of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>.

## The Emission of Hawking Radiation

[[Hawking Radiation and Information Paradox|Hawking radiation]] arises from the disruption of the quantum vacuum around a black hole's [[The Concept of Event Horizons and Spaghettification|event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:14">[00:32:14]</a>. In quantum mechanics, empty space is not truly empty but has a rich structure where particles are constantly coming in and out of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>, in accordance with the uncertainty principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>.

The black hole's distortion of space and time disrupts this structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>. An analogy, given by Hawking himself, describes particle pairs appearing near the horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a>. One particle might fall inside the horizon towards the singularity, while its partner escapes as a real particle, viewed as [[Hawking Radiation and Information Paradox|Hawking radiation]] from the outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.

This emission of particles means the black hole is glowing and losing energy, implying it has a temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:12">[00:34:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>. For known black holes, their lifetimes are immense, exceeding 10^100 years for supermassive ones, far greater than the current age of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>.

## The [[Hawking Radiation and Information Paradox|Information Paradox]]

The concept of black hole evaporation introduced a profound challenge to physics, known as the [[Hawking Radiation and Information Paradox|information paradox]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.
If a black hole eventually evaporates into nothing, what happens to the information about everything that fell into it? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a> The laws of nature, particularly quantum mechanics, clearly state that information cannot be destroyed; it can only be scrambled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:49">[00:37:49]</a>.

Initially, Hawking's 1974 calculation suggested that the emitted [[Hawking Radiation and Information Paradox|radiation]] was "informationless" or purely thermal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>. This meant that any record of what fell into the black hole would be erased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>. This contradicted the fundamental principle of information conservation, bothering physicists for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:59">[00:37:59]</a>.

For example, if a piece of paper is burned, its information is theoretically still present in the ashes and radiation, though scrambled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. However, the initial understanding of black holes suggested that such information was truly lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>.

### Recent Developments and Proposed Solutions

In 2019, a series of papers, including one by Jeff Pennington, suggested that Hawking might have missed a subtle aspect of his calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>. These papers propose that the [[Hawking Radiation and Information Paradox|radiation]] is *not* information-free at the end of the process, and all information about what fell in is imprinted in the radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>.

This idea leads to a complex physical picture, as it implies information can somehow escape the black hole without violating the rule that nothing can come out of a black hole once it crosses the [[The Concept of Event Horizons and Spaghettification|event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>.

#### The Holographic Principle

A key concept in understanding this is the [[Black Holes and Their Impact on Understanding Space and Time|holographic principle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:49">[00:40:49]</a>. Discovered by Jacob Bekenstein in the 1970s, the entropy of a black hole (a measure of hidden information) is proportional to the surface area of its [[The Concept of Event Horizons and Spaghettification|event horizon]], not its volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:45">[00:42:45]</a>. This suggests that information about the interior of a black hole might be encoded on its surface, as if the universe is a hologram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.

This principle suggests a "dual description of nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:52">[00:52:52]</a>, where a 3D reality can be fully described by a 2D surface. This allows for the possibility that information about objects falling into a black hole is stored near the horizon and can be released via [[Hawking Radiation and Information Paradox|Hawking radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>.

#### Black Hole Complementarity

The [[Hawking Radiation and Information Paradox|information paradox]] also highlights the idea of "black hole complementarity," proposed by Leonard Susskind and Gerard 't Hooft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>. This concept suggests that both perspectives of an object falling into a black hole are correct:
*   **From the infalling object's perspective:** According to [[Einsteins theory of relativity and black holes|Einstein's theory]], an observer freely falling into a large black hole would not notice anything as they cross the [[The Concept of Event Horizons and Spaghettification|event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. They would eventually be [[Spaghettification and tidal forces near black holes|spaghettified]] as they approach the singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>.
*   **From an external observer's perspective:** Time appears to slow down for the infalling object as it approaches the horizon, eventually seeming to stop there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. The object would appear to get redder and redder (redshifted) and slowly fade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>. From this external view, the object would be "vaporized" before crossing the horizon, and its "ashes" or information would be collected as [[Hawking Radiation and Information Paradox|Hawking radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>.

The idea of complementarity suggests that both "demises" (incineration from outside, [[Spaghettification and tidal forces near black holes|spaghettification]] inside) are valid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>. This raises further questions about whether the infalling information is "copied," but the "no cloning theorem" in quantum mechanics states that a quantum state cannot be perfectly copied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>.

#### Wormholes and Entanglement

One speculative picture to resolve the paradox involves wormholes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:18">[00:48:18]</a>. It's theorized that the interior of the black hole might be connected to the exterior via wormholes, allowing information to exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>. This idea is linked to the "ER = EPR" conjecture, where Einstein-Rosen bridges (wormholes) are equivalent to Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) quantum entanglement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. This suggests that quantum entanglement might be understood as a wormhole connecting two entangled particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>.

#### The Firewall Paradox

The "firewall paradox" is a related problem that challenges the equivalence principle, a core idea in [[Einsteins theory of relativity and black holes|Einstein's theory of relativity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>. It suggests that the [[The Concept of Event Horizons and Spaghettification|event horizon]] might not be smooth from the infalling observer's perspective, but rather a "firewall" of high energy that incinerates anything crossing it, thereby violating the equivalence principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>. This implies there might not truly be an "inside" to a black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06">[01:01:06]</a>. The jury is still out on whether this paradox has been fully resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>.

## Broader Implications

The study of [[Hawking Radiation and Information Paradox|Hawking radiation]] and the [[Hawking Radiation and Information Paradox|information paradox]] is at the forefront of modern physics, acting as a "Rosetta stone" to translate between different pictures of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>. It's helping to unlock deeper questions about the universe itself, particularly regarding the nature of space and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:53">[00:57:53]</a>.

This research has connections to:
*   **[[Inner Workings of Black Holes|Inner Workings of Black Holes]]**: Our understanding of what happens inside a black hole.
*   **[[Black Holes and Their Impact on Understanding Space and Time|Emergent Spacetime]]**: The idea that space and time might not be fundamental but emerge from a deeper underlying structure, possibly a network of quantum bits (qubits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. This concept, known as "it from bit," was proposed by John Wheeler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>.
*   **Quantum Computing**: The techniques developed to understand black holes are the same ones needed to comprehend how quantum computers work, and insights from black hole research are contributing to building these powerful devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:12">[00:58:12]</a>.
*   **[[Potential connections between black holes and the universes beginning|The Universe's Beginning]]**: The singularity inside a black hole, being the "end of time," is often compared to the Big Bang singularity, the "beginning of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:43">[01:03:43]</a>. While different (black holes are high entropy, the early universe was low entropy), understanding one might shed light on the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>.

This field is rapidly developing, with new papers and discussions constantly emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. The fundamental questions posed by black holes continue to push the boundaries of our understanding of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>.

A new show titled "Let me explain" is launching, aiming to provide "journalistically rigorous, genuinely optimistic explanations about technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The creator describes it as "like Black Mirror, but the opposite, and journalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, suggesting that the world might not be terrible in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Each episode will be a deep dive into an idea that "could change all of our lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

The show's creator is a video journalist who previously worked for Vox for five years, primarily covering tech and economics for *Explained* (Netflix/Vox YouTube) and TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Critique of Current Media Narratives

The journalist observes a historical pattern in how new ideas are discussed: from "It’s not possible" to "It’s too expensive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, "Do people really need that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, and "Oh, it’s just a fad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, before eventually acknowledging, "Oh my god, it changed the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

Journalists often "love to shit on new ideas as implausible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, partly because such stories are "easier to tell" and popular with readers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This approach can lead to missing out on potential positive developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

There is a perceived prevalence of fear-mongering and pessimism in media, especially noticeable on platforms like TikTok, where there's a strong feeling that "The world is just not a good place to live in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a> and "it’s getting worse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This contributes to political nihilism and economic fear, making people feel helpless and powerless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

The journalist believes that while it's a journalist's job to be skeptical and point out [[challenges_and_optimism_in_media_narratives | challenges]], there is also a responsibility to "help people imagine what could go right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. An earlier engagement with the possibility of positive outcomes could lead to better guidance for new tools and technologies, allowing for course correction before things go "off the rails" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## A New Journalistic Approach

To pursue this more optimistic perspective, the journalist has decided to undertake a [[transition_from_vox_to_independent_journalism | transition from Vox to independent journalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. This allows for covering topics in a "personal" and experimental way, with a distinct tone of voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

The new show will:
*   Take one big idea and "imagine it works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   Explore what that world would look like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   Discuss what is needed to ensure it helps the most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   Compare it to the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   Focus on "what could go right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

The show aims to feature insights from "incredible experts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, other journalists, and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. There's also an emphasis on audience engagement, encouraging viewers to ask questions and suggest topics that make them feel pessimistic or overwhelmed, with the promise to "try and find the best ways that we have to solve them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

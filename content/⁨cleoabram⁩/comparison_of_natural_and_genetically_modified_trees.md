Genetic engineering has enabled the manipulation of living organisms, including crops, animals, and humans, over recent decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. In the face of a global man-made disaster driven by increased carbon dioxide and other emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, researchers are now applying [[genetic_engineering_for_enhanced_carbon_capture_in_trees | genetic engineering]] to mitigate [[role_of_supertrees_in_climate_change_mitigation | climate change]] by developing "[[role_of_supertrees_in_climate_change_mitigation | supertrees]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This endeavor is part of a future responsibility for humanity to deliberately and continuously regulate the atmosphere for all living things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. A key ethical question arises: "How much do we change other species to do it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## How Genetically Modified Trees Differ

Maddie Hall, CEO of the company engineering these trees, explains that [[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | genetic engineering]] involves incorporating new genes, often from other plants, into tree cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. These altered plant cells are then grown on "selection media" to develop into shoots and roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Enhanced Photosynthesis

Natural trees perform photosynthesis, taking in carbon dioxide, sunlight, and water to produce oxygen and sugars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. A primary goal for engineered trees is to make this process more efficient, thereby increasing carbon capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

A key difference lies in the enzyme "rubisco," crucial for photosynthesis. In natural trees, rubisco sometimes incorrectly picks up oxygen instead of carbon dioxide, leading to "photorespiration." This process wastes energy and releases carbon dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Through [[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | gene editing]], the expression of genes controlling this process can be altered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### The Gene Gun Technology

A tool called a "gene gun" is used to introduce new genes. This device coats gold particles with DNA fragments and then shoots them into plant cells, leading to the incorporation of these genes into the plant's genome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This method is favored from a regulatory standpoint because it does not introduce non-plant pest genes or use bacteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

Early results indicate that some genetically modified seedlings exhibit enhanced photosynthesis and a higher rate of carbon assimilation compared to their natural counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This demonstrates the potential to significantly increase the amount of carbon trees can absorb from the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

## Why Genetically Modify Trees Instead of Just Planting More?

Patrick, a co-founder of the tree engineering company, addresses why modifying trees is necessary:
*   **Scale of the Problem:** If only natural trees were planted without enhancing their carbon drawdown ability, approximately a trillion trees would be needed to account for anthropogenic carbon emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Efficiency:** By enhancing carbon capture, the required number of trees could be reduced to around 500 billion, significantly lessening the planting effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **Magnified Impact:** A small change in an individual organism can be magnified to a much larger impact when spread across a vast number of organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### Limitations of Natural Tree Planting

Planting a massive number of natural trees, even the unaltered kind, faces challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>:
*   **Fast Carbon Cycle:** While trees absorb CO2 during photosynthesis, much of this carbon is released back into the atmosphere when leaves fall or the tree decomposes within a few years. This is part of the "fast" carbon cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Slow Carbon Cycle:** Burning fossil fuels introduces CO2 from the "slow" carbon cycle (carbon trapped deep underground for centuries), which is different from the carbon exchanged by living trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Ecological Impact:** Planting non-native trees, even if they grow quickly, can worsen the carbon problem by disrupting the delicate balance of local plants, microbes, and soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

## Addressing Concerns: Invasive Species and Native Environments

Maddie Hall emphasizes that the goal is not to plant a single genetically engineered species everywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Instead, the focus is on enhancing photosynthesis in plant species native to their specific environments, such as loblolly pine in Southeastern Georgia and longleaf pine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This approach aims to inspire local groups globally to improve the carbon capture capabilities of their native flora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. The research findings on photosynthetic efficiency have been made public to encourage more organizations to work on climate change and carbon removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

## Growth and Future Vision

While genetically engineered trees appear larger at similar ages, Patrick clarifies that there is no evidence yet that their final adult size will be different. Instead, they accumulate biomass more quickly, reaching their mature size faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

The company plans to scale up to commercial tree-planting operations, aiming for over 10 million trees by the end of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This marks the first commercial planting of a photosynthesis-enhanced organism in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

The broader vision is that humanity will need to take on the responsibility of regulating the atmosphere for the biosphere, a role no species has ever had before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. While humans are not the first species to destabilize the atmosphere (e.g., algae producing oxygen caused a mass extinction event) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, this initiative suggests that humanity could become the species that regulates atmospheric composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

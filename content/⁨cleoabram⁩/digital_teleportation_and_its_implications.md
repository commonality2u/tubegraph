Digital teleportation, as envisioned through [[augmented_and_virtual_reality_technology | augmented and virtual reality technology]] like the Apple Vision Pro, refers to the ability to instantaneously "jump to any place anytime" and "bring other people to you" in a digital space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. This concept extends beyond typical computer monitors or solo gaming, representing a direct path to a science-fiction-like ability that is physically impossible in the real world but potentially achievable in the digital one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. The ultimate goal is to create a sense of realism that allows people to feel genuinely present with others or in different environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

## Current Capabilities with Apple Vision Pro (V1)

The first version (V1) of the Apple Vision Pro showcases [[advancements_in_immersive_experiences | advancements in immersive experiences]] and a "profound technology" for spatial computing, blending digital content with the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

Key features contributing to early forms of digital teleportation include:
*   **Intuitive Control** The device offers hands-free interaction, with the cursor controlled by eye movement, making it feel more intuitive and "magical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. Users can select items by looking at them and tapping their fingers together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.
*   **[[advancements_in_immersive_experiences | Immersive Environments]]** Users can spin a button to become "more fully immersed" in 360-degree environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. The realism is enhanced by objects appearing "rock solid" in their space due to a sensor array and the R1 chip processing data in real time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. Additionally, realistic shadows are added to digital objects, moving as the objects are repositioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>. High-resolution micro OLED displays contribute to the convincing visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.
*   **Stereopsis for Depth** The headset leverages stereopsis, providing each eye with a slightly different image to create a sense of depth, mimicking how the brain perceives the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.
*   **Spatial Video for Memories** New iPhones can record "spatial video" that can be watched back in 3D on the Vision Pro, making memories feel "much more like memories," as if one can "teleport into them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. This offers the potential to revisit past moments or interact with digital representations of loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.
*   **Realistic Digital Objects** The device can render digital objects, such as a Formula 1 car, into the room with "shockingly real" reflections that do not "jiggle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>.

## Current Limitations: People Look Like Avatars

While digital objects appear highly realistic, human representations, or "personas," currently look like avatars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>. Apple's Persona feature involves scanning a user's face to create an avatar that, while recognizable, is not fully lifelike; for example, hair may appear "glued" and teeth/tongue are "made up" if not explicitly scanned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>. Despite these limitations, there have been significant improvements from earlier avatars, and competing platforms like Meta have also made strides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>.

## [[Technological advancements and future potential | Future Potential (V10)]] and Implications

The "huge" potential of this [[technological_advancements_and_future_potential | technology]] lies in its ability to enable digital teleportation to other places, into memories, and to see other people with a sense of realism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:19:00">[16:19:00]</a>. The optimistic future envisions a V10 (or later iteration) where digital avatars of people are indistinguishable from real presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

### Connecting People
The primary hope for the [[the_future_applications_of_disneys_technological_innovations | future applications]] of this technology is to enhance human connection and combat isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>. The evolution of telecommunications from telegrams to phone calls and video calls has consistently aimed for greater realism and presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. A realistic hologram that allows for conversation, body language, and eye contact would feel like "spending time with someone," akin to being in person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>.

This could have profound societal implications:
*   **Bridging Distances** Allowing long-distance family members, such as grandparents and grandchildren, or soldiers and their families, to feel connected as if they are in the same room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>.
*   **Combating Isolation** Addressing the trend of increasing isolation and loneliness, where people spend more time alone over their lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>. The goal is to make "spending time with other people" less difficult in a world where many live far from loved ones and work remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>.

### Historical Context
This [[technological_advancements_and_future_potential | technological advancement]] is compared to past innovations like the Apple Macintosh, which unlocked personal computing, and the iPhone, which enabled ubiquitous pocket computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Just as the first iPhone was a "bet on a new technology" that "changed humanity," the Apple Vision Pro could similarly have a "gigantic effect down the road on humans" by transforming how we use technology and share computing experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>. While the V1 is considered the "worst this tech will ever be," the rapid improvements expected suggest a future where digital presence is highly realistic and impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a>.

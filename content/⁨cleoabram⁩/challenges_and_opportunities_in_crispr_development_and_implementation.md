[[Gene editing with CRISPR technology | CRISPR]] (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) and [[Gene editing with CRISPR technology | CRISPR-Cas9]] are microscopic technologies that offer the power to edit genes in living organisms to cure diseases, potentially prevent others, and even enhance bodily capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This technology is already in use for real medicines, in plants to grow new crops, and in animals to create new species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Jennifer Doudna, a Nobel Prize laureate, is credited with its discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Opportunities and Applications

### Therapeutic Applications in Humans
[[Gene editing with CRISPR technology | CRISPR]] offers the potential to eliminate diseases like hemophilia, sickle cell anemia, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The technology provides a "programmable tool" that can be directed to essentially any DNA sequence to make targeted changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, functioning like a "text editor for the instruction manual of life" with quick and precise editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

A significant success is the [[Applications of CRISPR in medicine and agriculture | CRISPR-based therapy]] for sickle cell disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Approved by the FDA and its UK counterpart in late 2023, this one-and-done therapy treats patients with a single genetic mutation causing severe blood disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. It suppresses the disease-causing mutation by reactivating fetal hemoglobin production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Patients like Victoria Gray, the first US patient to receive this treatment, have experienced life transformations, no longer suffering sickle cell crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

[[Gene editing with CRISPR technology | CRISPR]] is well-suited for disorders resulting from a single gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Beyond treating existing conditions, [[Gene editing with CRISPR technology | CRISPR]] is being explored for preventing future diseases. A clinical trial is underway using [[Gene editing with CRISPR technology | CRISPR]] to prevent high cholesterol buildup and cardiovascular disease by making edits in liver DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. This could offer a one-time therapy to avoid daily medication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>.

### [[Potential genetic enhancements and their implications | Potential Genetic Enhancements]]
The technology also opens doors to [[Potential genetic enhancements and their implications | potential genetic enhancements]], such as modifying the MSTN gene for larger muscles, the DEEC2 gene for needing less sleep, or genes related to pain perception, potentially offering pain tolerance to cancer patients or those with chronic pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>.

### [[Applications of CRISPR in medicine and agriculture | Applications in Agriculture and Climate Science]]
The "extraordinary global impact" of [[Gene editing with CRISPR technology | CRISPR]] is expected to be seen first in plant and animal modifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:24">[00:38:24]</a>. Unlike traditional plant breeding, which involves random changes and lengthy processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>, [[Gene editing with CRISPR technology | CRISPR]] enables targeted, precise changes that can alter only one trait without affecting others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. It's possible to edit multiple genes (5, 10, or 15) simultaneously in plants, leading to sophisticated alterations safely and precisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>.

Examples include:
*   Increased yields and nutritional value in crops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>, such as a tomato approved in Japan with higher nutritional value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>.
*   Non-browning mushrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>.
*   Improving agriculture in the US, with tomatoes that are much higher yielding without changes to taste or look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>.
*   [[Innovations in digital biology and climate science | Addressing climate change]] by editing microorganisms in cattle to reduce methane emissions, a significant contributor to global carbon emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>. This could involve a single pill to edit the cow's microbiome sustainably over its lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>.

### Microbiome Editing
[[Gene editing with CRISPR technology | CRISPR]] can also be used to edit microorganisms (the microbiome) to impact human health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>. Research is exploring how the human microbiome profoundly affects health, including links between microbiome-produced molecules and susceptibility to asthma in children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:23">[00:45:23]</a>. [[Gene editing with CRISPR technology | CRISPR]] could potentially turn down the production of such molecules to prevent diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>. Other areas of interest include the connection between the microbiome and the brain, and the microbiome and the immune system, particularly in relation to inflammation and diseases like Alzheimer's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>.

## Challenges and Considerations

### [[Ethical implications of genetic modifications | Ethical Implications of Germline Editing]]
A significant divide in the debate revolves around editing somatic cells (changes end with the individual) versus germline cells (changes passed to future generations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. [[Ethical implications of genetic modifications | Germline editing]] raises concerns akin to eugenics or Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Changes made in embryos are permanent, irreversible, and passed on, potentially altering the "whole genetic makeup of human populations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

The spectrum of changes, from treating diseases to preventing future ones, to [[Potential genetic enhancements and their implications | enhancements]] or "super enhancements," also presents a "gray area" where defining the line between health-related modifications and enhancements is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.

### Safety and Control
Controlling DNA repair in embryos, which is part of the editing process, is still under investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. Until safety is well-understood, heritable gene editing remains a future aspiration, not something to be done today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.

The controversial 2018 case where a scientist edited human embryos to prevent HIV transmission highlights the risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. The technology had not been tested in animals prior to human application, and there were already effective, safe treatments for HIV transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. Furthermore, the genome editing was not "clean," resulting in "chimeas" (a mixture of different genetic makeups in the cells) with unknown long-term effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>.

### Delivery Challenges
A major technical hurdle is delivering [[Gene editing with CRISPR technology | CRISPR]] molecules into specific cells or tissues in the body, such as lungs, liver, or brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. While the liver is an "easy" target due to its natural filtering function and the use of lipid nanoparticles (like in COVID vaccines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>, getting the genome editor into *only* the affected cells in complex organs like the brain, while ignoring others, is very tricky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. Scientists are studying how viruses and bacteria achieve such targeted delivery to develop new strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

### Cost and Access
Current [[Applications of CRISPR in medicine and agriculture | CRISPR-based therapies]] are very expensive, limiting access for many who could benefit globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. The sickle cell therapy also requires hospitalization for a bone marrow transplant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Efforts are underway to make therapies deliverable in an easier format that doesn't require hospitalization and at a lower cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

### Regulatory and Societal Acceptance
Different countries have ongoing debates about how [[Challenges and Controversies in Agricultural Automation | genetically altered crops]] will be regulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. In the United States, if changes to plant DNA could be achieved through traditional breeding (even if taking decades), they are not considered genetically modified by the USDA and are not regulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:13">[00:42:13]</a>. This means [[Applications of CRISPR in medicine and agriculture | CRISPR-edited crops]] could soon appear in grocery stores without specific labeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>.

A major societal concern is the potential for a "gene gap" or societal divide based on wealth, where only a few can afford certain [[Potential genetic enhancements and their implications | genetic modifications]], similar to the movie *Gattaca* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>. However, new technologies often start expensive and become more accessible over time, suggesting that initial limited access shouldn't halt development if the long-term benefit is widespread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>.

### Complexity of Genetic Traits
While [[Gene editing with CRISPR technology | CRISPR]] is effective for single-gene disorders, it is much harder to treat complex diseases like schizophrenia, which likely result from hundreds of mutations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Additionally, genes are interconnected, meaning tweaking one thing might lead to unintended "lots of other" changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>.

## The Future of [[Gene editing with CRISPR technology | CRISPR]]
The development of [[Gene editing with CRISPR technology | CRISPR]] was driven by human curiosity and fundamental scientific breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:49">[00:48:49]</a>. As our understanding of genetics grows, so does the potential for [[Gene editing with CRISPR technology | CRISPR]] to transform human health and environmental sustainability. While the power to control our species' genetic future is both "awesome and terrifying," deciding how to handle it may be the biggest challenge yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>.

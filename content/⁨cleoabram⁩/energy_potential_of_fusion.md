Nuclear fusion involves smashing tiny atoms like hydrogen or helium together to create a larger atom. This process results in a small amount of mass being lost, which is converted into energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. While scientists can currently achieve [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion|nuclear fusion]] by smashing atoms together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, the primary [[challenges_of_creating_commercial_nuclear_fusion_energy|challenge to creating commercial nuclear fusion energy]] is that more electricity is required to initiate the reaction than is produced by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

## Fusion vs. Fission

To understand the [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion|basics of nuclear fusion]], it helps to differentiate it from nuclear fission:
*   **Fission**: This process involves cracking a large atom, such as uranium, into smaller atoms, releasing energy as a small amount of mass is lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
    *   Uncontrolled fission powers an atomic bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
    *   Controlled fission is used in all current usable nuclear power plants for electricity generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Fusion**: This involves smashing tiny atoms like hydrogen or helium together to form a larger atom, releasing even more energy than fission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
    *   Uncontrolled fusion can be used to create hydrogen bombs, which have been tested but never used in warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
    *   Controlled fusion is the focus of ongoing research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## Benefits of Fusion Energy

The urgency for [[fusion_as_a_solution_for_climate_change|fusion as a solution for climate change]] and clean energy sources has increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Fusion offers several compelling advantages:
*   **High Energy Density**: Fusion can produce millions of times more energy for the same amount of mass compared to fossil fuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. While fission has a similar energy density, fusion is slightly higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Reduced Proliferation Risk**: Fusion inherently carries fewer safety risks, particularly concerning nuclear proliferation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Unlike fusion bombs, which still contain fissionable materials like uranium and plutonium, fusion by itself is not a proliferation concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Clean and Abundant**: If successful, fusion could provide cheap, clean, and inexhaustible energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## How Fusion Energy is Achieved at Scale

Achieving fusion at scale requires containing and pressurizing plasma, a superheated state of matter where atoms have broken into their constituent neutrons, electrons, and protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### Confinement Methods
There are three main methods currently explored to confine plasma for large-scale fusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>:

1.  **Gravitational Confinement**: This is the method powering the universe, such as in the sun, where immense gravity compresses and heats fuel to fusion temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This is not feasible on Earth due to the inability to build systems of such large scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
2.  **Magnetic Confinement**: This method uses electronics and magnetic fields to contain the plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. A common machine for this is a tokamak, which heats and confines plasma as it circles until it reaches fusion temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
3.  **Inertial Confinement**: Instead of steady confinement, this approach rapidly compresses the fusion fuel, often by shooting lasers at plasma, in a billionth of a second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. This creates "plasma blinks" rather than a continuous plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

Some [[fusion_reactors_and_techniques|fusion reactors and techniques]] combine these methods. For example, magnetoinertial confinement blends magnetic confinement (holding fusion fuel) with inertial confinement (compression) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. This method creates a man-made star, where plasma is ejected, compresses, increases in pressure and temperature, gets brighter, and then expands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

## Challenges of Commercializing Fusion

Despite the immense potential, significant [[challenges_of_nuclear_fusion|challenges of nuclear fusion]] remain for commercialization:
*   **Energy Input vs. Output**: Currently, all human-made fusion methods require more electricity to operate than they produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. This is the core barrier to widespread use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   **Fuel Material Rarity**: While fusion fuels like deuterium and tritium (a form of hydrogen) don't pose nuclear proliferation concerns like fission materials, tritium is rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. An alternative, helium-3, is also rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. There is ongoing debate in the fusion community about the best materials for scalable fusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Despite the [[challenges_of_creating_commercial_nuclear_fusion_energy|challenges of creating commercial nuclear fusion energy]], the potential societal impact of abundant, cheap energy from fusion is profound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. This energy could reduce human suffering and enable new experimentation to improve lives, making it a compelling reason for continued investment in fusion research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. The history of electricity itself, which took centuries from understanding charge to practical use, serves as a reminder that major technological advancements often take a long time to materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

While building small-scale fusors in a workshop is relatively easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>, this is distinct from creating commercial-scale fusion reactors, highlighting the [[comparison_between_smallscale_fusors_and_commercial_fusion_reactors|comparison between smallscale fusors and commercial fusion reactors]].

Air travel, while transforming human connection and global trade, has significantly contributed to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the atmosphere, particularly within the last grandparents' lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This has created a critical juncture where a vital innovation in human history is on a collision course with our future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The need to create better airplanes is paramount to addressing these environmental challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## The Problem: Soaring Emissions

The history of aviation shows a steady increase in CO2 emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Aviation's impact is significant, making the development of more sustainable aircraft a crucial step in reducing carbon emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## The Solution: Electric Airplanes

Companies like Beta are building new types of electric airplanes to combat this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The concept of electric aviation isn't new; some early airships in 1883 were electric, using heavy batteries made from zinc and chlorine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. However, batteries were historically too large and heavy to compete with liquid fuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### [[advancements_in_battery_technology_for_aviation | Advancements in Battery Technology]]

Significant [[advancements_in_battery_technology_for_aviation | advancements in battery technology]] have made electric flight more viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Modern electric planes, such as those by Beta, utilize commercial off-the-shelf lithium-ion cells, similar to those found in Tesla cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. One battery pack for an electric plane can hold the same amount of energy as a standard Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

Key battery metrics for aviation include:
*   **Volumetric energy density**: How much energy can be stored relative to its size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Gravimetric energy density (specific energy)**: How much energy can be stored relative to its weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

While batteries have become significantly smaller and lighter in the last decade, they still weigh substantially more than aviation fuel for the same energy output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. For instance, in 2010, batteries needed 50 times more weight to output the same energy as aviation fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Crucially, fuel planes get lighter as they burn fuel, whereas batteries maintain their weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Despite these challenges, [[advancements_in_battery_technology_for_aviation | innovation in battery packaging and individual cell improvement]] has led to a surge in investment in electric planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## Rethinking Aircraft Design

The advent of electric planes allows for a redesign of aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Electric motors are lighter and smaller than fuel engines, offering more flexibility in placement on the aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. This enables innovations like Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. VTOL aircraft can access locations without traditional airports, opening up aviation to new areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## Impact on Emissions Reduction

While current electric planes may not replace large passenger planes in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, they can still make a significant impact on emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

A breakdown of aviation emissions reveals:
*   A third of passenger flight emissions come from short-haul flights (less than 1500 kilometers or 932 miles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   Very short flights account for a disproportionate amount of emissions because the fuel used for takeoff is a larger percentage of the overall flight, and less efficient planes are often used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   Electrifying these short flights can make a substantial dent in overall emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### [[future_of_freight_and_delivery_with_electric_planes | Electric Planes for Freight and Delivery]]

Beta is specifically focusing on electric planes for freight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This focus is particularly interesting because electric VTOL aircraft have the potential to reduce carbon emissions from other sources, such as road transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Companies like UPS are investing in electric planes, considering how delivery logistics could change if reliance on roads was reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Electric planes represent a step towards a more sustainable future for transportation, without having to wait for distant technological breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

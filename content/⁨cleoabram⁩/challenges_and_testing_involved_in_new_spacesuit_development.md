Only 12 people have ever walked on the Moon, all within a four-year span. For the past 50 years, no one has returned, but that is set to change with upcoming missions to prepare for long-term lunar living and eventual human missions to other planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. To achieve this, astronauts need to survive and work for extended periods in extremely dangerous space conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

The existing spacesuits for lunar missions are decades old and require a significant upgrade to enable this next chapter in space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. These new suits are designed to give astronauts the "superpower" to do more, for longer durations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## The Need for Next-Generation Spacesuits

[[design_and_functionality_of_the_new_spacesuit_by_axiom_space | Axiom Space]] was selected by NASA to build the Artemis III spacesuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This marks the first time NASA has outsourced the production of its suits to replace the aging and outdated legendary models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The new suits will be used for NASA's upcoming Artemis III mission, which plans for four astronauts to leave Earth in 2026, with two descending to the lunar surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. They will spend 6.5 days on the Moon, double the previous record, marking the first human return since 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This mission will explore the lunar south pole, hoping to find crucial resources like water and metals for future lunar living and Mars missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

To achieve these ambitious goals, astronauts need suits that:
*   Allow them to stay on the lunar surface longer than ever before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   Provide protection against extreme heat and cold, especially in areas that never receive sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   Offer increased [[improvements_in_mobility_and_flexibility_for_astronauts | flexibility and range of motion]] for their tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   Fit a wider range of body types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## The Perils of Space and the Role of Spacesuits

Without a spacesuit, exposure to the vacuum of space presents multiple immediate dangers:
*   **Lack of Atmosphere/Oxygen** The first problem is the absence of atmosphere, leading to no oxygen and no pressure to keep the body intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. The pressure difference would cause all air to rush out of the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Holding one's breath would be fatal, potentially causing lungs to pop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Loss of Consciousness** Within about 15 seconds, the brain would stop receiving oxygen from the blood, leading to blacking out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Swelling and Boiling** Lower pressure causes the body to swell, and the boiling point of water inside blood and tissues drops, turning it into vapor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. While the skin is stretchy enough to prevent explosion, swelling would occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Extreme Temperatures** Without atmosphere, there's no ambient temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. In sunlight, one side of the body could heat up to 150°C, while the other side, in shadow, would slowly freeze to -150°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Radiation and Debris** Surviving initial exposure would lead to severe radiation poisoning and cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Additionally, flying objects moving faster than bullets could shred the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

Survival is possible if rescued within approximately 90 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Therefore, spacesuits are critically important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

> "Your life depends on this. It has that reliability and that robustness built into it to protect you from all these things that could harm you." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>

Spacesuits are not just clothing; they are human-shaped spacecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, providing an atmosphere with breathable oxygen and necessary pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

### Types of Spacesuits

Spacesuits fall into two main categories:
1.  **Launch and Entry Suits**: These are high-altitude suits, like the orange space shuttle suits or SpaceX's white and black suits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Their primary function is to act as a personal atmosphere if the vehicle loses cabin pressure, allowing for a safe re-entry to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Early Mercury program suits were primarily these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
2.  **EVA Suits (Extravehicular Activity Suits)**: Known by NASA as the "Extravehicular Mobility Unit" (EMU), these suits enable astronauts to work outside a spacecraft, whether on the Moon's surface or floating in low Earth orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Some EMUs are for surface walks, others for zero-gravity spacewalks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

## Design and Functionality of the New Axiom Suit

The new [[design_and_functionality_of_the_new_spacesuit_by_axiom_space | Axiom Space]] suit is an EVA suit designed for lunar surface missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. It incorporates decades of achievements in spaceflight, manufacturing, design, chemistry, textile science, and thermodynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

### Suit Layers
Spacesuits consist of multiple layers, primarily three major sections:
1.  **Inner Bladder Layer**: This layer holds the pressure required for the astronaut's body to operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. It feels similar to dishwashing gloves but is made of a fancy proprietary material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
2.  **Restraint Layer**: Positioned atop the bladder layer, this layer prevents the suit from inflating like a balloon due to internal pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. Crucially, it also defines how the suit can move, influencing the astronaut's range of motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
3.  **Insulation Layer**: This is the black outer layer of the prototype (though it will be white on the Moon to reflect light and keep cool) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. It protects astronauts from dangerous radiation, cuts, and punctures from dust and debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

### Key Improvements and Features
*   **Sustainable Design**: Unlike older EMUs that were designed for 14-day missions and required refurbishment on Earth, the new suit is designed from the ground up to be maintained on orbit or during missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This sustainability aims to bring down [[cost_and_accessibility_considerations_of_nextgeneration_spacesuits | spaceflight costs]] over time, making space more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **Cost Reduction**: Older NASA suits from the 1970s reportedly cost around $150 million in today's dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. While NASA initially gave Axiom $228 million for development, the plan is to reduce the cost per suit with increased production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **Advanced Thermal Management**: Astronauts wear a liquid cooling garment underneath the suit, with water running through tubes to regulate body temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. The new boots also feature unique proprietary insulation to protect feet from the extremely cold lunar surface in permanently shaded regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Mobility**: The suit is engineered to bend and flex with the human body, making it easier to collect samples, conduct research, and traverse the lunar surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. Astronauts must learn specific movements adapted to the suit's constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   **Modular Sizing**: Unlike previous custom-designed Apollo suits, the new suits use a modular design with small, medium, and large base options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. Additional pieces are swapped and tailored to fit individual astronauts, covering 90% of men and women in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. This approach opens the door to space for more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

### Astronaut Practicalities Inside the Suit
*   **Waste Management**: Astronauts use a "MAG" (maximum absorbency garment), which is essentially a diaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **Dealing with Itchiness**: Itching is a known issue, with astronauts attempting to use the neck ring or Valsalva maneuver, but often having to "deal with it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## Rigorous Testing and Development Process

The development of the new spacesuit involves continuous testing and updating of prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, as astronauts' lives depend on the precision and quality of the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Pre-Suit-Up Requirements
Before entering a suit, test subjects undergo medical tests and must sign waivers, as the suit's full pressurization can be dangerous with certain medical conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### Manufacturing Precision
While some parts of the manufacturing process, like cutting, are automated, much of the suit assembly is handmade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. Stitching requires extreme precision, often done by hand and slowly, with extensive inspection and quality control to ensure safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. The handmade nature is partly due to the low volume of spacesuits produced, making high automation unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

### Pressurization and Movement Training
*   **Pressurization**: Suits are pressurized to 4.3 PSI (pounds per square inch), a significant increase from sea-level pressure (14.7 PSI) that feels like diving to the bottom of a pool, requiring ears to be popped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. This internal pressure makes movement harder and stiffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.
*   **Training Suits**: Axiom uses a "1G analog suit," or training suit, for astronauts to practice motions and tool use during geologic training in Earth gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Astronauts must learn specific paths for movements, as arms do not move as freely as outside the suit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

### Physical Challenges and Suit Performance
Astronauts are expected to spend about 13 hours in the suit during a real EVA day, highlighting the physically demanding nature of the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. Tests conducted on Earth with the prototype involve:
*   **Collecting Samples**: Simulating breaking off and collecting lunar rock samples using tools like a chisel and hammer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.
*   **Mobility**: Walking fast on a treadmill designed for horses, noting the unusual waddling motion due to the suit's structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. The suit's cooling system ensures comfort even during exertion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.
*   **Squatting**: Attempting a squat in full Earth gravity, bearing the suit's significant weight (estimated 150-200 lbs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.
*   **Kneeling**: Successfully placing one knee on the ground and getting back up, a position previously impossible in older EVA suits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.

The development of these spacesuits represents an immense amount of work and human ingenuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>. Every detail is meticulously designed and tested to prepare humanity to go farther than ever before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>.

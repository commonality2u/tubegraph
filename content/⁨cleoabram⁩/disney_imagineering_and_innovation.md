Walt Disney Imagineering is the department responsible for bringing Disney's "craziest ideas to life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Established by Walt Disney himself, Imagineers were tasked with thinking "outside the box" to create Disneyland, building rides, robots, and castles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Their job is to bring the magic of Disney to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

Today, Imagineers operate a research and development (R&D) lab where they constantly develop new ideas for Disney parks worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The core purpose of all their technological advancements is to make people happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, fostering an emotional connection with guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

## Innovations in Robotics and Interactive Experiences

### BDX Droids: Personality-Driven Robotics

Imagineering develops advanced robotics, exemplified by their "BDX units," which are notable for their expressive personalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

#### Design and Control
These droids are not autonomous; they are controlled by a person using a console that dictates their movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. While the operator tells the droid *what* to do (e.g., walk, throw a tantrum), the droid's specific responses are determined by its training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

#### Training and Reinforcement Learning
The [[training_and_design_of_disney_droids | training and design of Disney droids]] for these robots involves creating a series of animations, inspired by ducklings, for various actions like walking, jumping, or shimmying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. A digital version of the robot is then placed in a simulation where it undergoes [[ais_potential_to_change_society_and_industries | reinforcement learning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

Unlike typical robot training focused solely on achieving a goal (e.g., walking from A to B), these droids are rewarded for both task completion and how closely they adhere to the pre-designed animations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This dual objective of functionality and "cuteness" adds complexity to their development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This simulation allows for thousands of "reps" without physical damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. The learned behaviors are then uploaded to the physical robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

The focus on personality and emotional connection in robotics is a cutting-edge aspect of their design, aiming to make humans want to interact with robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Realistic Lightsaber

Lanny Smoot, a famous Imagineer with over 100 patents, invented the "most realistic expandable extendable lightsaber" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

#### Mechanism
Unlike movie props that require post-production visual effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, this lightsaber features a smooth extension of its blade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. It works by unrolling two long, translucent tapes from internal motors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. These tapes bend into a concave shape to form a rigid blade, which is lined with bright LEDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. The LEDs are programmed to create a realistic flickering glow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a> and respond to movement, blinking to simulate the blade's travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This prop is designed for extension and retraction, not for battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

### Holotile: Omnidirectional Treadmill

Also invented by Lanny Smoot, the Holotile is an omnidirectional treadmill that allows users to walk in any direction while staying in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

#### How it Works
The floor of the Holotile is composed of rotating circular tiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Each tile has a gear at the bottom for overall spin and another at the top to control the angle of its head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Your shoe interacts with the top of this angled disc, which pushes you back towards the center as you walk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

The system tracks user movement using lidar cameras surrounding the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. One camera at floor level identifies the foot's position, while a second camera determines its direction by tracking the shin bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. The demo unit featured six lidar angles to ensure clear tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. The Holotile can also be controlled with a video game controller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Its primary purpose is currently for fun, with Imagineers testing designs and playing games on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>, potentially for future park attractions or film production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

### Stuntronics: Robot Stunt Doubles

Stuntronics are robot stunt doubles designed to perform complex and dangerous stunts that would be unsafe or impossible for human performers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. For example, the Spider-Man stuntronic in Disneyland experiences forces of up to 10 G's during its launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

#### Development
The development process involved repeatedly flinging a basic metal stick with motors and actuators, gradually refining its movements to be more human-like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. This iterative process involved hundreds of throws, tracking results, and improving motion control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. Imagineers are open to using stuntronics in movies, though they haven't been requested yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

## The Philosophy of Disney Innovation

According to Josh D'Amaro, who oversees Disney parks, cruises, and products, the ultimate purpose of all this technology is "to create a connection with our guests" and "make them feel something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. Kevin Feige, President of Marvel Studios, emphasizes that the technology serves to continue storytelling and immerse the audience in the world, a feat Imagineering excels at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

> "The purpose at the end of the day is to create a connection with our guests. To make them feel something." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>

Imagineering's approach is distinct from general robotics; it prioritizes emotional impact and storytelling over mere utility or convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. The goal is to ensure that while people are alive, they have opportunities to "just be a kid" and "feel... joy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. This philosophy aligns with the broader [[importance_of_optimistic_visions_for_future_innovation | importance of optimistic visions for future innovation]].

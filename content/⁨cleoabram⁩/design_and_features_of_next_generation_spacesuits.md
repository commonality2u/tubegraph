Only 12 people have ever walked on the Moon, all within a four-year period, and for 50 years, no one has returned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. However, this is set to change as astronauts will soon return to the Moon to prepare for long-term habitation and future missions to other planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. To achieve these ambitious goals, astronauts must be able to survive and work for hours in extremely dangerous space conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The current spacesuits for lunar missions are decades old and require a significant upgrade to enable this next chapter in space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. These new [[development_and_testing_of_nasas_new_spacesuit|spacesuits]] are designed to grant astronauts the "superpower" to perform more tasks for longer durations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## The Need for New Spacesuits

The upcoming [[axiom_spaces_role_in_artemis_iii_mission|Artemis III]] mission, planned for 2026, will send four astronauts to the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Two astronauts will descend to the lunar surface and spend 6.5 days there, double the longest previous stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This will be the first human return to the Moon since 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. They will also be the first to explore the lunar south pole, searching for crucial resources like water and metals for future lunar habitation and Mars missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

To accomplish this, astronauts need:
*   The ability to stay on the lunar surface longer than ever before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   Enhanced protection against extreme heat and cold, particularly in permanently shaded regions that never receive sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   Greater flexibility and range of motion for tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   Suits that can fit a wider range of body types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Axiom Space's Contribution

NASA selected [[axiom_spaces_role_in_artemis_iii_mission|Axiom Space]] to build the [[axiom_spaces_role_in_artemis_iii_mission|Artemis III]] spacesuit, marking the first time NASA has outsourced spacesuit production to replace its aging and outdated legendary suits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Axiom Space is developing a prototype and conducting extensive [[development_and_testing_of_nasas_new_spacesuit|testing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## Spacesuits as "Human-Shaped Spacecraft"

Spacesuits are not merely high-tech clothing; they are effectively one-person, human-shaped spacecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. An astronaut's life depends on the suit's reliability and robustness to protect against the myriad dangers of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

### Dangers of Space Without a Suit
Without a spacesuit, the vacuum of space presents immediate threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>:
*   **Lack of Atmosphere/Pressure:** The primary danger is the absence of atmosphere, leading to no oxygen and no external pressure to keep the body together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. The pressure difference would cause all air to rush out of the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Holding breath could cause lung rupture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Oxygen Deprivation:** Within about 15 seconds, the brain would lose oxygen, leading to blackout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Swelling and Boiling Fluids:** Lower pressure causes the body to swell, and the boiling point of water in blood and tissues drops, turning internal fluids into vapor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. However, the skin is stretchy enough to prevent an explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Extreme Temperatures:** Without an atmosphere, there's no ambient temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Direct sunlight can heat one side of the body to 150°C, while the shaded side simultaneously freezes to -150°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Radiation:** High radiation levels would poison the body and cause cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Debris:** High-velocity flying objects, faster than bullets, could shred the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Survival in space without a suit is possible for about 90 seconds if rescued quickly, but after that, survival is unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

## Types of Spacesuits

Spacesuits fall into a few major categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>:
*   **Launch and Entry Suits:** These include the orange Space Shuttle suits and the white-and-black SpaceX suits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. They act as a personal atmosphere in case the vehicle loses cabin pressure, allowing for safe re-entry to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Early Mercury program suits were primarily high-altitude suits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Suits:** Also known as Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMUs), these suits enable astronauts to go outside the spacecraft, whether on the Moon's surface or floating in low Earth orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. The new Axiom Space suit is an EVA suit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## Design and Features of Next Generation EVA Suits

The new [[development_and_testing_of_nasas_new_spacesuit|Artemis III]] spacesuit is designed to be much more sustainable and cost-effective than previous models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Unlike the EMUs originally designed for 14-day missions requiring refurbishment on Earth, this new suit is designed from the ground up to be maintained on orbit or on mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This approach aims to reduce spaceflight costs over time, increasing access to space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. While 1970s NASA suits reportedly cost around $150 million in today's dollars, NASA provided Axiom $228 million for the new model's [[development_and_testing_of_nasas_new_spacesuit|development]], with a plan to reduce per-suit costs as more are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

### Key Layers and Components:
1.  **Liquid Cooling Garment (LCG):** Worn underneath the spacesuit, this garment has tubes that circulate water to keep the astronaut cool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
2.  **Inner Bladder Layer:** This layer holds the suit's internal pressure, providing the necessary atmosphere and oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. It's made of a proprietary material, similar to a fancy dishwashing glove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
3.  **Restraint Layer:** Positioned on top of the bladder layer, this layer prevents the suit from inflating like a balloon due to pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. It also dictates how the suit can move, requiring astronauts to practice specific movements for tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
4.  **Outer Insulation Layer:** This black outer layer on the prototype will be white in the final Moon suit to reflect light and keep cool, potentially with design input from Prada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. It protects astronauts from certain radiation, cuts, and punctures from dust and debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
5.  **Primary Life Support System (PLSS):** A large backpack in the final suit, it processes oxygen and carbon dioxide, providing a continuous atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

### Advanced Features:
*   **Pressurization:** Spacesuits are pressurized to 4.3 PSI (pounds per square inch) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. This increase in pressure, comparable to diving to the bottom of a pool, requires astronauts to clear their ears, similar to popping ears on an airplane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.
*   **Mobility:** Despite pressurization causing stiffness, the suits are designed to allow specific, controlled movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. Astronauts train with 1G analog suits to learn these motions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. New suits enable movements previously impossible in current EVA suits, like kneeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.
*   **Advanced Boots:** The boots feature unique proprietary elements for insulating the astronaut's feet from the extremely cold lunar surface in permanently shaded regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.
*   **Modularity and Fit:** The suits are designed to fit 90% of men and women in the United States, unlike previous Apollo suits custom-designed for each astronaut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. Axiom uses small, medium, and large base options, tailoring additional pieces based on detailed measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. This modular design will open space to many more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.
*   **In-Space Maintainability:** The new suit is built to be maintained on orbit or during missions, which is a significant departure from older designs that needed to be returned to Earth for refurbishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This contributes to cost reduction and sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

### Manufacturing Process
The production of these suits involves a blend of automation and highly precise handcrafting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. While processes like cutting fabrics are automated, much of the assembly and stitching is done by hand due to the extreme precision required and the relatively low production volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. Extensive inspection and quality control are paramount to ensure the suit's safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Sewing a spacesuit is a highly technical and precise job, with a dedicated crew ensuring the suit can keep someone alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

## Astronaut Experience and Challenges in the Suit

Astronauts prepare by undergoing medical tests and signing waivers, as the suit's full pressurization can have dangerous consequences if certain medical conditions exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. EVA days can last about 13 hours inside the suit, presenting challenges like managing bodily functions (using a "maximum absorbency garment" or MAG) and dealing with minor discomforts like itching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

> [!INFO] A prototype suit on Earth can weigh between 150 to 200 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. Although it will feel much lighter on the Moon due to lower gravity (one-sixth of Earth's), movement remains challenging due to the suit's design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.

## The Interplanetary Future

The [[development_and_testing_of_nasas_new_spacesuit|new spacesuits]] are a marvel of human engineering, representing decades of advancements in spaceflight, manufacturing, design, chemistry, textile science, and thermodynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. They are a critical next step in humanity's interplanetary future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. These portable spacecraft are made as small, flexible, and human-shaped as possible to facilitate tasks like collecting samples, conducting research, and traversing the lunar surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. They will help humanity reach beyond our planet and unlock an interplanetary future that only our species has ever attempted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

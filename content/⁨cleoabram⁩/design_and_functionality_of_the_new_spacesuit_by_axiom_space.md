NASA is preparing for humanity's return to the Moon and eventual journeys to other planets, necessitating a major upgrade to spacesuits, which have not been updated in decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. These new suits are designed to equip astronauts with the "superpower" to perform more tasks for longer durations in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## A New Era of Spacesuit Production

For the first time, NASA has outsourced the production of its spacesuits to Axiom Space, replacing the aging and outdated legendary suits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Axiom Space is building the new suits for NASA's upcoming Artemis III mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This shift represents a major transition in the approach to human space travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## Mission Goals and Challenges Addressed

The new spacesuits are crucial for the Artemis III mission, planned for 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Two astronauts will descend to the lunar surface and spend 6.5 days there, double the duration of any previous Moon mission, and marking the first human return since 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. They will explore the lunar south pole, hoping to find resources like water and metals vital for establishing a lunar presence and future missions to Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

To achieve these goals, the new suits must provide:
*   The ability for astronauts to stay on the lunar surface longer than ever before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   Protection against extreme heat and cold, especially in areas that never receive sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   Increased [[improvements_in_mobility_and_flexibility_for_astronauts | flexibility and range of motion]] for performing tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   A fit for a wider range of body types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Spacesuits as Human-Shaped Spacecraft

Spacesuits are not merely high-tech clothing; they are sophisticated, human-shaped spacecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. They provide the necessary atmosphere and pressure for human survival in the vacuum of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

### Surviving the Dangers of Space

Without a spacesuit, the vacuum of space presents immediate life-threatening dangers:
*   **No Atmosphere/Oxygen**: Immediate lack of breathable air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Pressure Difference**: The pressure difference between the body's interior and exterior causes air to rush out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Holding one's breath can lead to lung rupture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Swelling and Boiling Fluids**: Lower external pressure reduces the boiling point of water in blood and tissues, causing it to turn into vapor and the body to swell, though the skin is stretchy enough to prevent explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Blackout occurs in about 15 seconds due to lack of oxygen to the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Temperature Extremes**: Without an atmosphere, there is no ambient temperature. Direct sunlight can heat one side of the body to 150°C, while the shaded side simultaneously freezes to -150°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Radiation and Debris**: Prolonged exposure leads to radiation poisoning and cancer. High-speed flying objects can cause physical damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Survival is possible if rescued within 90 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

## Spacesuit Layers and Components

Spacesuits consist of multiple layers, each serving a critical function:

1.  **Liquid Cooling Garment (LCG)**: Worn underneath the suit, water runs through tubes in this garment to regulate the astronaut's body temperature and prevent overheating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Astronauts use a "maximum absorbency garment" (MAG), or diaper, for waste management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
2.  **Inner Bladder Layer**: This layer contains the suit's internal pressure and atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
3.  **Restraint Layer**: Positioned over the bladder, this layer prevents the suit from inflating like a balloon due to pressure and dictates the suit's range of motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.
4.  **Outer Insulation Layer**: This black prototype layer will be white in the final Moon suit to reflect light and keep the astronaut cool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. It protects against certain radiation, cuts, and punctures from dust and debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
5.  **Primary Life Support System (PLSS)**: A backpack component that processes oxygen and carbon dioxide for breathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

## Design and Manufacturing Process

Axiom Space's new spacesuits are prototypes undergoing continuous [[challenges_and_testing_involved_in_new_spacesuit_development | testing and updating]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. The manufacturing process involves significant human precision:
*   **Handmade Components**: Despite technological advancements, much of the suit is handmade, with machines used for automation only where high production volumes would justify it, such as in the cutting process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. Precision stitching is often done by hand, requiring rigorous inspection and quality control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.
*   **Modular Design for Fit**: Unlike previous Apollo suits custom-designed for each astronaut, Axiom's suits use small, medium, and large base options, with additional pieces tailored for individual fit. This modular approach aims to fit 90% of men and women in the United States, making space more accessible to diverse body types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

## [[improvements_in_mobility_and_flexibility_for_astronauts | Mobility and Functionality]]

The new suits enhance astronaut mobility for surface operations:
*   **Specific Movement Paths**: Astronauts learn to move their limbs along specific paths dictated by the suit's design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   **Pressure Effects**: As the suit is pressurized to 4.3 PSI (compared to Earth's sea-level pressure of 14.7 PSI), movements become stiffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Maneuverability**: The suit allows for movements previously impossible in older EVA suits, such as squatting and kneeling, which are crucial for collecting samples and research on the lunar surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.
*   **Insulated Boots**: The boots feature proprietary insulation to protect feet from the extreme cold of the lunar surface, especially in permanently shaded regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

## [[cost_and_accessibility_considerations_of_nextgeneration_spacesuits | Cost and Sustainability]]

A key design principle for the new suits is maintainability on orbit, moving away from the "fly up, come down, refurbish" cycle of previous suits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This sustainability is intended to lower overall spaceflight costs over time, increasing accessibility to space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. While NASA provided Axiom $228 million for development, the long-term plan is to reduce the cost per suit as more are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

The new spacesuits represent a "marvel of human engineering," incorporating decades of achievements in various scientific and technological fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. They are a critical step in humanity's interplanetary future, pushing modern technology to its limits to enable future space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. The development of these suits underscores the vast amount of work and human ingenuity involved in preparing humanity to venture farther than ever before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.

[[cern_and_the_large_hadron_collider | CERN]], the world's biggest and most famous physics lab, located on the border between France and Switzerland, hosts the largest science experiment ever built: the [[cern_and_the_large_hadron_collider | Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This underground particle smasher involved thousands of people from over 100 countries, cost $5 billion, and took over 30 years to plan and build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Thousands of scientists globally gather at [[cern_and_the_large_hadron_collider | CERN]] to conduct cutting-edge research into how the universe works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## The Large Hadron Collider (LHC)

The [[cern_and_the_large_hadron_collider | LHC]] is a massive tunnel, over 100 meters underground and 27 kilometers long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Inside, two pipes are kept colder and emptier than outer space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Through these pipes, particles smaller than atoms, specifically protons, are fired in opposite directions, pushed faster and faster until they are almost at the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. When they smash together, subatomic debris flies into a massive detector, such as the Atlas detector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

The collider itself is extremely precise. Particles are squeezed by thousands of magnets into a space the width of a human hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. To achieve collisions, [[cern_and_the_large_hadron_collider | CERN]] fires 100 billion protons in bunches in each direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. On average, only about 50 or 60 collisions occur per crossing, which is why the process is repeated 30 million times per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Why Smash Particles?
The primary goal of smashing particles at such high energies is to glimpse what might have happened near the start of our universe, the Big Bang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. These collisions release enormous amounts of energy, which, due to the relationship between energy and mass, can turn into physical mass and potentially mysterious or unknown particles – new building blocks of our universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Scientists analyze the resulting "crime scene" of everyday particles to reverse engineer what mystery particles might have existed for an instant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. This pure research aims to understand the fundamental fabric of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

## Fundamental Discoveries: The Standard Model and Higgs Boson

[[cern_and_the_large_hadron_collider | CERN]]'s research centers on studying elementary particles, the fundamental building blocks of our universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Our current understanding of these particles is codified in "The Standard Model," a mathematical description of how the world works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### The Search for the Higgs Boson
A major reason for building the [[cern_and_the_large_hadron_collider | Large Hadron Collider]] was to detect a predicted, yet unobserved, "mystery particle" called the Higgs Boson, also sensationally known as the "God Particle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. The Standard Model suggested the Higgs Boson's vital importance to universal existence because its detection would confirm an underlying field responsible for giving other particles mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. In essence, it would help understand "why stuff exists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

### Confirmation and Impact
After the [[cern_and_the_large_hadron_collider | LHC]]'s completion, thousands of scientists spent two years collecting data, ultimately confirming the reliable creation of the Higgs Boson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This discovery, visible as a "bump on a chart," proved a previously unknown truth about our universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. While not immediately changing daily life, this confirmation validated humanity's scientific approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Similar to Sir Isaac Newton's discoveries, the long-term impact of finding these fundamental building blocks is immeasurable, paving the way for future [[technological_advancements_and_future_potential | technologies]] that cannot yet be imagined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

## Future Research: The [[future_circular_collider_and_its_potential_impact | Future Circular Collider]] (FCC)

Despite the [[cern_and_the_large_hadron_collider | LHC]]'s successes, scientists believe there are limits to what it can reveal, and much remains unknown about the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. This has led to a debate about building an even larger collider, the [[future_circular_collider_and_its_potential_impact | Future Circular Collider]] (FCC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

### The Search for Dark Matter
One of the "big holes" in our understanding is dark matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. While invisible, its gravitational effects are observed, for instance, in how light bends around galaxies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Dark matter is estimated to account for 27% of our universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. While there's no guarantee the [[future_circular_collider_and_its_potential_impact | FCC]] will find dark matter, it might answer other questions or reveal entirely new phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

### Proposed FCC and Debate
The proposed [[future_circular_collider_and_its_potential_impact | Future Circular Collider]] would cost roughly $17 billion and span 100 kilometers, compared to the [[cern_and_the_large_hadron_collider | LHC]]'s 27 km <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Not everyone supports this, with some arguing the [[cern_and_the_large_hadron_collider | LHC]] fell short of some hopes, and even more energy might be needed to produce truly new findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. However, supporters emphasize that not trying means not discovering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

## Byproducts and Applications

The pure scientific research conducted at [[cern_and_the_large_hadron_collider | CERN]] has already yielded significant, unexpected byproducts and applications:
*   New therapies for [[healthcare_system_and_cancer_treatment_advancements | cancer treatment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>
*   Better medical imaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>

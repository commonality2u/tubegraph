The internet, as it currently exists for the vast majority of international traffic, is primarily a physical network of over 800,000 miles of cables crisscrossing the oceans, with roughly 436 active cables as of 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. These cables transmit information as flashes of light, carrying an estimated 99% of current international internet traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. While this infrastructure is a "marvel of human ingenuity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>, it is not enough to provide global internet access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.

## The Problem: The Digital Divide

Despite the advanced nature of the current internet infrastructure, a significant portion of the global population lacks access to fast, reliable internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>. This disparity is known as the [[the_global_disparity_in_energy_usage_and_responsibility | Digital Divide]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.

Reasons for this divide include:
*   **Geographical challenges** In some areas, it is prohibitively difficult to lay cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.
*   **Political and conflict threats** Ground-based services can be jeopardized by political instability or war, as seen in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.
*   **Economic non-viability** During peacetime, companies may deem it financially unfeasible to lay cables in rural areas where fewer people would subscribe to their service, leading to higher charges for those who do get connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.

Data suggests the problem is significantly underestimated. While the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) reported that about 14 million people lacked access to fast internet based on self-reported data from internet service providers, Microsoft's estimate was over 120 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. This discrepancy arises because providers can count an entire census block as having high-speed internet even if only one household in that block receives service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.

The [[the_global_disparity_in_energy_usage_and_responsibility | Digital Divide]] exists not only between countries but also within them, between cities and rural communities, and even within communities themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>. This problem is crucial to solve because internet access is essential for participating in modern society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>, encompassing issues of both accessibility and affordability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>.

## Proposed Solutions: Satellite Internet

A new push, dubbed the [[the_great_internet_space_race | Great Internet Space Race]], by billionaires like Elon Musk (Starlink), Jeff Bezos (Project Kuiper), and Richard Branson (OneWeb), aims to provide internet access from space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This concept of communications satellites dates back to Telstar 1, launched in 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.

Unlike fiber optic cables that use light, satellites transmit binary information (1s and 0s) as radio waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. Historically, satellite internet has been slower, more expensive, and less reliable than cable internet due to high latency from satellites orbiting at high altitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.

However, the new projects differentiate themselves by deploying satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO), which significantly reduces latency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. This approach requires more satellites to cover the same area, but it aims to make satellite internet faster, cheaper, and more widely available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>.

Starlink, led by Elon Musk, is currently ahead in this race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>. It offers surprisingly high bandwidth and low latency for a satellite system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a> and even uses visible light between satellites, similar to fiber cables, giving them a potential speed advantage in the vacuum of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>. While fiber is expected to remain dominant in most places, Starlink could be a game-changer in underserved areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>.

These new satellite systems aim to bridge the [[the_global_disparity_in_energy_usage_and_responsibility | Digital Divide]] by serving "hardest to serve customers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a> and providing broadband to the roughly 4 billion people who currently lack it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>.

## Impact of Increased Internet Access

The core impact of these technologies is realized when they make services faster, better, *and* cheaper, transforming luxuries into commodities accessible to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a>.

Research indicates that increased internet access leads to:
*   Job growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>
*   More new businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>
*   Reduced unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>
*   Better health outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>
*   Improved access to education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>

The pandemic highlighted the extreme importance of internet access for participation in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>. New satellite systems, alongside continued investment in existing infrastructure, are vital for addressing the [[the_global_disparity_in_energy_usage_and_responsibility | Digital Divide]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:00">[14:54:00]</a>.

[[introduction_to_quantum_computers|Quantum computers]] are not merely faster or bigger versions of [[difference_between_classical_and_quantum_computers|classical computers]]; they are an entirely different kind of technology built for entirely different purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>. This fundamental difference is key to understanding why they are considered such a significant [[technological_advancements_and_future_potential|advancement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a>.

## A Different Kind of Calculation

Unlike [[difference_between_classical_and_quantum_computers|classical computers]] which use bits (representing a state of either zero or one), [[introduction_to_quantum_computers|quantum computers]] operate on "qubits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:10">[09:03:10]</a>. Qubits are more complex, possessing a probability of being either zero or one, much like a wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:10">[09:10:10]</a>. When a [[introduction_to_quantum_computers|quantum computer]] operates, the probabilities of multiple qubits interact, constructively or destructively, similar to waves in a pond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:10">[09:27:10]</a>. Instead of trying all options, a [[introduction_to_quantum_computers|quantum computer]] observes these interactions to find the most likely answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:10">[09:59:10]</a>. This unique method of calculation makes [[introduction_to_quantum_computers|quantum computers]] adept at different tasks than [[difference_between_classical_and_quantum_computers|classical computers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:10">[10:11:10]</a>. For example, while they are not faster at simple addition, they excel at finding structure in vast amounts of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:10">[10:18:10]</a>.

### The "Boat" Analogy

A helpful analogy describes [[introduction_to_quantum_computers|quantum computers]] not as faster cars (like improved [[difference_between_classical_and_quantum_computers|classical computers]]), but as boats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:10">[05:06:10]</a>. While a boat isn't inherently better than a car, it's designed for entirely different terrain—mathematical "waters" that [[difference_between_classical_and_quantum_computers|traditional computers]] cannot navigate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:10">[05:12:10]</a>. This allows for the exploration of new mathematical problems and areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:10">[05:20:10]</a>. This analogy can be extended to a "submarine," suggesting deeper levels of exploration within a "bottomless ocean" of possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:30:10">[14:30:10]</a>.

## Key Areas of Application

### Simulating Nature

One of the primary new areas of interest for [[introduction_to_quantum_computers|quantum computers]] is "simulating nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:10">[10:53:10]</a>. Nature itself is fundamentally quantum and obeys quantum physics at a molecular and atomic level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:10">[11:00:10]</a>. [[difference_between_classical_and_quantum_computers|Classical computers]] struggle to calculate the behavior of materials or atoms beyond a certain size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:10">[11:17:10]</a>. [[introduction_to_quantum_computers|Quantum computers]], however, are essential for:
*   Developing new battery technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:10">[11:24:10]</a>
*   Creating novel materials with long chains of molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:10">[11:31:10]</a>
*   Predicting how nature behaves at a molecular scale, leading to new medicines and molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:10">[11:43:10]</a>

### Addressing [[quantum_computing_and_encryption_challenges|Encryption]] Challenges

A significant concern and [[technological_advancements_and_future_potential|future]] [[applications|application]] of [[introduction_to_quantum_computers|quantum computing]] lies in its potential impact on [[quantum_computing_and_encryption_challenges|encryption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:10">[12:12:10]</a>. The first major algorithm developed for [[introduction_to_quantum_computers|quantum computers]] was Shor's Algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:10">[12:38:10]</a>. This algorithm can efficiently find prime factors for very large numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:10">[12:43:10]</a>. This is critical because "RSA [[quantum_computing_and_encryption_challenges|encryption]]" – the basis for most internet transactions – relies on the mathematical difficulty of factoring large numbers with [[difference_between_classical_and_quantum_computers|classical algorithms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:10">[12:50:10]</a>. While a [[difference_between_classical_and_quantum_computers|classical computer]] would take billions of years to crack RSA, a [[introduction_to_quantum_computers|quantum computer]] could potentially do it in hours to days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:10">[13:07:10]</a>.

This capability fuels a global race, as the nation that first develops a practical [[introduction_to_quantum_computers|quantum computer]] with code-breaking capabilities would have a tremendous advantage, potentially leading to [[quantum_supremacy_and_global_competition|Quantum Supremacy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:10">[13:19:10]</a>. However, current [[introduction_to_quantum_computers|quantum computers]] (like IBM's record of 433 qubits) are not yet powerful enough to achieve this, requiring millions of qubits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:10">[13:31:10]</a>. Despite this, experts anticipate a shift to "quantum-safe algorithms" within five years or less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:10">[13:50:10]</a>.

## The [[future|Future]] of [[introduction_to_quantum_computers|Quantum Computing]]

[[introduction_to_quantum_computers|Quantum computing]] is progressing at an incredibly fast rate, solving problems that were intractable just a few years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:10">[14:06:10]</a>. Since nothing mathematically or physically prevents their continued improvement, engineers will find ways to advance the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:10">[14:25:10]</a>. This continuous improvement is expected to lead to the discovery of new [[technological_advancements_and_future_potential|applications]] that have not yet been considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:10">[14:49:10]</a>.

The ultimate goal is to develop technology that enables fundamentally different and better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:10">[16:08:10]</a>. This includes making the world a better place and, profoundly, learning more about the universe, which is inherently quantum mechanical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:10">[16:21:10]</a>.

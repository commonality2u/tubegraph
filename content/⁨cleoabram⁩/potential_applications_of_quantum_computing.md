[[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | Quantum computers]] are not merely faster or bigger versions of current computers; they are a fundamentally different technology poised to impact our lives sooner than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This distinction is crucial for understanding their potential applications. They calculate things very differently than [[classical_vs_quantum_computing | classical computers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a> and excel at finding structure in large amounts of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

## A New Mode of Computation: Boats, Not Faster Cars

A helpful analogy describes the progression of computational ability:
*   Early manual calculations were like walking across a mathematical map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   Early computers allowed "riding horses," covering more ground faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   Modern computers are like cars on roads, reaching previously inaccessible areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

However, [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computers]] are not faster cars; they are like "boats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. They are built for entirely different terrain—"new mathematical waters"—solving problems and discovering areas that traditional computers cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This means a [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computer]] will likely never "beat" an iPhone or be in your pocket like a conventional device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## Simulating Nature

One significant new area of interest for [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computing]] is the simulation of nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Nature is fundamentally quantum and obeys quantum physics, especially at the molecular and atomic levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

While it is currently difficult for [[classical_vs_quantum_computing | classical computers]] to calculate what a material or atom will do at certain sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computers]] will be essential for:
*   Developing new battery technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
*   Creating new materials with long chains of molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   Predicting the behavior of nature at a molecular scale to enable new medicines and molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

## Breaking and Building Encryption

Another critical application, often discussed with concern by governments, is [[quantum_computers_and_encryption | encryption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

### Shor's Algorithm
The first major algorithm developed for [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computers]] is Shor's Algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. This algorithm can efficiently find prime factors for very large numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, which is the basis for RSA [[quantum_computers_and_encryption | encryption]]—the method for most internet transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. While a [[classical_vs_quantum_computing | classical algorithm]] would take billions of years to crack RSA, a [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computer]] could potentially do it in hours or days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

This capability fuels a global race, as the nation that first develops a practical [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computer]] with code-breaking capabilities would have a tremendous advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

### The Path to Quantum Supremacy
Currently, the largest [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computer]] has 433 [[qubits_and_how_they_function | qubits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. However, breaking current internet security with Shor's Algorithm would likely require a million [[qubits_and_how_they_function | qubits]] or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Despite this gap, progress is rapid, with experts confident that quantum-safe algorithms will become necessary within five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. As technology advances, nothing mathematically or physically prevents continued improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

## A Bottomless Ocean of Possibilities

The development of [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computing]] is an ongoing journey, comparable to exploring a "bottomless ocean" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. As the technology continues to iterate and improve annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, new applications that have not yet been considered are likely to be discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. This pursuit is driven by the desire to develop technology that enables fundamentally different and better things, and to learn more about the world, which is inherently quantum mechanical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

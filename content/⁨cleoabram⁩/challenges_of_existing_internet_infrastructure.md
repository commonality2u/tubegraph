The internet, a marvel of human ingenuity, is predominantly powered by a vast network of underwater cables, not satellites in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. This infrastructure, primarily composed of over 800,000 miles of cables crisscrossing oceans, carries up to 99% of current international internet traffic as of 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. These cables transmit binary information (1s and 0s) as flashes of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. Laying these cables is a slow process, taking weeks for ships to cross oceans at about 7 miles per hour, literally weaving a web around the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. While incredibly complex and effective, this existing infrastructure faces significant challenges that hinder universal internet access.

## Limitations of Cable-Based Internet

Despite its sophistication, the current cable-based internet infrastructure has several inherent limitations:

*   **Geographical Difficulty**
    *   In some regions, laying cables is prohibitively difficult due to challenging terrain or deep ocean trenches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. While cables are laid all the way to the ocean floor, avoiding the deepest parts can be difficult and expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.
*   **Vulnerability to Geopolitics and Conflict**
    *   Crucial ground-based internet services can be threatened by political instability or war, as exemplified by the situation in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>.
*   **Financial Viability in Rural Areas**
    *   During peacetime, companies may deem it not financially worthwhile to lay cables in rural communities where there aren't enough people to pay for their service, leading to areas with no high-speed internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>. Even if they do, they might charge significantly more, making it unaffordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.

## The [[digital_divide_and_accessibility_of_internet | Digital Divide]]

A significant consequence of these limitations is the [[digital_divide_and_accessibility_of_internet | Digital Divide]], which refers to the disparity in internet access both between and within countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.

*   **Scope of the Problem**
    *   Many people globally, especially in developing countries, lack internet access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>.
    *   Even in countries like the US, millions lack access to fast internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.
*   **Underestimation of the Problem**
    *   Data on internet access is often underestimated. For example, the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) reported that about 14 million people lacked fast internet access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. However, Microsoft's estimate was over 120 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>.
    *   The FCC's data is based on self-reported information from internet service providers using Form 477, which allows them to count an entire census block as having broadband service if even one person in that block can receive it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. This method wildly underestimates the true scope of the [[digital_divide_and_accessibility_of_internet | digital divide]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>.
*   **Accessibility and Affordability**
    *   The [[digital_divide_and_accessibility_of_internet | Digital Divide]] is fundamentally a twin problem of both accessibility (can you get it?) and affordability (can you pay for it?) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>.

## Historical Challenges of Satellite Internet

While current [[starlink_and_satellite_internet | satellite internet]] projects aim to address these issues, older satellite systems, like HughesNet and Viasat, had their own set of challenges:

*   **High Latency**
    *   These older systems placed satellites very high up and kept them stationary over a single spot, covering vast areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>. However, the extreme distance resulted in very high latency (the time it takes for information to travel back and forth) due to the long travel time for radio waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>.
*   **Performance and Cost**
    *   Historically, internet via fiber optic cables (using visible light) has generally been faster, cheaper, and more reliable than satellite internet (using radio waves) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. Satellite internet also typically cost more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>.

## Impact of Limited Internet Access

The internet is crucial for participating in modern society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. The problems with existing infrastructure mean that:

*   **Socio-Economic Disparities**
    *   Where internet access is limited or absent, there is less job growth, fewer new businesses are formed, and unemployment tends to be higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>.
    *   People in these areas often experience poorer health outcomes and reduced access to education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>.
*   **Luxury vs. Commodity**
    *   If new technologies like [[starlink_and_satellite_internet | satellite internet]] only result in better and faster service but not cheaper, internet access remains a luxury primarily for the wealthy or high-frequency traders, rather than becoming a commodity available to all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>. The true impact comes when technology makes things faster, better, *and* cheaper, turning luxuries into commodities accessible to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:00">[14:28:00]</a>.

These challenges highlight the need for continued investment in existing systems and the development of new solutions, such as those proposed by [[the_great_internet_space_race | The Great Internet Space Race]], to ensure broader and more equitable internet access globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:00">[14:54:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>.

Dogs often have significantly shorter lifespans than humans, leading to the difficult experience of watching them grow old and pass away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. However, ongoing research aims to understand and potentially extend the lives of dogs, which could also provide insights into human aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. There are now [[advancements_in_antiaging_research_for_dogs | anti-aging efforts for dogs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, with the potential to also benefit humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

## Debunking the "Seven Dog Years" Myth

The common belief that [[debunking_the_seven_dog_years_myth | one human year equals seven years for dog years]] is widely recognized by veterinarians as [[debunking_the_seven_dog_years_myth | "the myth that never dies"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This idea is not based on scientific research, but rather on the rough estimation that humans live to about 70 and dogs to 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

Geneticists at UC San Diego have developed [[debunking_the_seven_dog_years_myth | a much more scientific way to compare your dog's age to yours]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Their research indicates that the aging process is not linear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>:
*   A 1-year-old dog is roughly equivalent to a 30-year-old person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   A 14-year-old dog is equivalent to a 70-year-old person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

This means that dogs as a species age faster than humans when they are young, and slower when they are old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Conversely, humans age slower when young and faster when old compared to dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Quantifying Aging

A core goal in anti-aging research, such as that pursued by the company Loyal, is to develop a comprehensive quantified aging process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. While much is still unknown about aging in both dogs and humans, current understanding suggests that aging is linked to a series of cellular damages that accumulate over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. These cellular damages are thought to lead to the various diseases experienced in old age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

One method of measuring aging involves examining changes to DNA, specifically modifications called "methylation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. These modifications predictively change with age, serving as an "aging clock" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. The UC San Diego research utilized this by comparing DNA from Labradors collected over 16 years with human DNA samples ranging from 1 to 103 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This provides a deeper understanding of underlying age-related issues like frailty, cancer, and disease, beyond visible signs like thinning hair or wrinkles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## The Impact of Dog Breed Size on Longevity

[[the_impact_of_dog_breed_size_on_longevity | Dog breeds live shockingly different lengths of time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. There can be a two-fold variance in lifespan, with a Great Dane potentially living 6-8 years while a Chihuahua can live 18 years or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. [[the_impact_of_dog_breed_size_on_longevity | Big dogs generally live shorter lives than small dogs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

This strong correlation is largely attributed to selective breeding by humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. While dogs are born at very similar sizes, larger breeds grow metabolically at a much faster rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. It's believed that the growth-promoting mechanisms in larger dogs do not fully "turn off" or function correctly after they are fully grown, causing them to age and die sooner on average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Small dogs may hold the secret to longer canine lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## Loyal's Research and Future Potential

Loyal, a company founded by Celine Halioua, is dedicated to better understanding and slowing aging in dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Their research focuses on the differences between dog breeds, particularly aiming to make the metabolism of a big dog more akin to that of a small dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

Currently, Loyal is in the research phase, working to identify specific areas that can be targeted with specific drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. As of now, there is no readily available pill that can extend a dog's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. However, Loyal's mission is to develop drugs that help dogs live longer, healthier lives, and in doing so, to learn more about aging that could eventually benefit people too <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

This research highlights the significant value of the time shared with dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. While there is no immediate [[advancements_in_antiaging_research_for_dogs | anti-aging solution YET for dogs]], continued progress in this field offers hope for extending these precious companionships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

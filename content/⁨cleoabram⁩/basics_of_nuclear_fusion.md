[[basics_of_nuclear_fusion_and_its_principles | Nuclear fusion]] involves smashing atoms together to create larger atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This process releases a small amount of mass, which is converted into a significant amount of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Researchers can currently achieve [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion_and_its_principles | nuclear fusion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Fusion vs. Fission

To understand [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion_and_its_principles | nuclear fusion]], it's helpful to differentiate it from nuclear fission:

*   **Fission**: Cracking a large atom, like uranium, into smaller atoms. This process releases energy when a little mass is lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
    *   *Uncontrolled [[history_of_nuclear_reactors | fission]]*: An atomic bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
    *   *Controlled [[history_of_nuclear_reactors | fission]]*: The source of electricity generation in all currently operational nuclear power plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Fusion**: Smashing tiny atoms, such as hydrogen or helium, together to form a larger atom. This also results in a loss of mass, but releases even more energy than fission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
    *   *Uncontrolled [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion_and_its_principles | fusion]]*: Used to create a hydrogen bomb. These bombs have been tested by several countries but have never been used in warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
    *   *Controlled [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion_and_its_principles | fusion]]*: The goal for a future energy source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

[[basics_of_nuclear_fusion_and_its_principles | Fusion]] offers the potential for millions of times more energy output from the same amount of mass compared to fossil fuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. While fission has a similar energy density, [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion_and_its_principles | fusion]] is considered to have fewer safety risks, particularly concerning nuclear proliferation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. A [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion_and_its_principles | fusion]] bomb (hydrogen bomb) still contains uranium and plutonium, functioning as a [[history_of_nuclear_reactors | fission]] bomb that utilizes [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion_and_its_principles | fusion]] to potentially enhance its energy output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion_and_its_principles | Fusion]] by itself is not considered a proliferation concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

## Plasma: The State of Matter for Fusion

Achieving [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion_and_its_principles | fusion]] at scale requires transforming matter into plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Plasma is the fourth state of matter, beyond solid, liquid, and gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. In plasma, atoms have so much energy that their individual components (neutrons, electrons, and protons) break apart and fly around freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

The primary challenge in [[using_nuclear_fusion_as_an_energy_source | controlled fusion]] is keeping this plasma confined and pressurized for a sufficient duration to allow fusion to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Methods of Plasma Confinement

The sun naturally achieves [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion_and_its_principles | fusion]] through gravitational confinement, where its immense size and gravity pull the plasma in, compressing and heating it until it fuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. On Earth, however, different methods are required as we cannot replicate the sun's gravitational forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

Three main methods for confining plasma to achieve [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion_and_its_principles | fusion]] at scale include:

*   **Magnetic Confinement**: This method uses magnetic fields to contain the plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. A common machine used for this is called a tokamak, where fusion plasma circles around, is well-confined, and heated until it fuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Inertial Confinement**: Instead of steadily holding fusion fuel, this approach compresses it extremely quickly, typically in a billionth of a second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. This is achieved by shooting lasers at the plasma, pushing it together rapidly to cause fusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. This results in "plasma blinks" rather than a continuous plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   **Magneto-Inertial Confinement**: Some companies, like Helion, are exploring a hybrid approach that combines magnetic confinement to hold the fusion fuel and inertial confinement for rapid compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. This aims to leverage the benefits of both methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

## Materials for Fusion

The materials required for [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion_and_its_principles | fusion]] are not typical hydrogen and helium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. While they don't pose the same nuclear proliferation concerns as [[history_of_nuclear_reactors | fission]] materials, some are rare and challenging to acquire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. The two most commonly used types of hydrogen in [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion_and_its_principles | fusion]] are deuterium and tritium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. Tritium is rare, and if it's unavailable, helium-3 (also rare) can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. There is ongoing debate within the [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion_and_its_principles | fusion]] community regarding the best materials for scaling up [[using_nuclear_fusion_as_an_energy_source | fusion]] for widespread use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

## Current State of Fusion Technology

Despite advancements, all current [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion_and_its_principles | fusion]] methods developed by humans require more electricity to initiate the reaction than they produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. This is a significant hurdle for [[using_nuclear_fusion_as_an_energy_source | fusion]] to become a viable energy source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. However, the pursuit of [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion_and_its_principles | fusion]] is considered highly urgent due to the increasing threat of [[challenges_in_nuclear_fusion_energy_production | climate change]] and the global need for more clean energy sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

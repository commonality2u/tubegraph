[[nuclear_fusion_basics | Nuclear fusion]] involves taking two particles and, at very high energies, forcing them together where they fuse to form a heavier particle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This process requires high energies, typically involving high voltage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## How Fusion Works

In a [[nuclear_fusion_basics | fusion]] reaction, two deuteriums (each consisting of a neutron and a proton) fuse together to form helium-4 (which has two protons and two neutrons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The resulting helium-4 is extremely hot, and energy is extracted from this particle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Each fusion reaction produces tremendously more energy than it took to fuse the particles together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Methods of Confinement

To achieve [[nuclear_fusion_basics | fusion]], plasma needs to be confined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

*   **Gravitational Confinement**: The Sun achieves fusion by using gravity to confine plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Magnetic Confinement**: Humans use magnets to confine plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Examples of devices include the Stellarator (twisty-turny) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, Helion's cylindrical devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, and the Tokamak (donut-shaped with a D-shaped cross-section) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Inertial Confinement**: This method can involve using lasers to push plasma close together, causing particles to fuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Electrostatic Inertial Confinement**: The [[building_a_diy_farnsworth_fusor | Farnsworth fusor]], a compact small device, uses this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. In this approach, ions stream spherically from all angles to a central core, where they collide and fuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Key Components for a Fusor

All [[fusion_reactors_and_techniques | fusion devices]] require a vacuum chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. To perform fusion in a fusor, [[nuclear_fusion_basics | fusion]] fuel (deuterium) and fusion power supplies are necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

### Identifying Fusion

When [[nuclear_fusion_basics | fusion]] is happening, the plasma produced from deuterium appears as a "fuchsia color," which is the eye perceiving blue and bright red photons simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Knowing the temperature and energy of the particles, along with observing their collisions, indicates that fusion is occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

> [!INFO] Safety with High Voltage
> When working with high voltage, it's important to approach it safely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Key rules include not touching with two hands and not putting one's head into the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Commercial vs. Small-Scale Fusion

While small-scale devices like fusors can achieve fusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>, they are not designed for commercial electricity generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. [[comparison_between_smallscale_fusors_and_commercial_fusion_reactors | Commercial electricity systems]] are significantly larger and more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. The primary [[challenges_of_nuclear_fusion | challenge with fusion]] for practical energy production is generating more total electricity from the system than is consumed to create the fusion reaction itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

However, the rate of technological progress is advancing, with private companies and governments now building systems capable of commercial levels of fusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. It is believed that [[energy_potential_of_fusion | fusion electricity]] could be on the grid within our lifetimes, and potentially much sooner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

Mark Zuckerberg envisions a future shaped by advanced technology, particularly in the realm of [[technological_advances_enabling_ai_capabilities | AI]] and mixed reality. His goal is to paint a picture of the future Meta is building, allowing individuals to decide what they think of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>. This future centers on two primary values: a feeling of "presence" through augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality, and "personalized [[machine_learning_and_its_impact_on_ai_development | AI]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:23">[01:11:23]</a>.

## The Future of Social Interaction and Presence

Meta's "full holographic augmented reality glasses" are described as the first of their kind, miniaturizing computing to place full holograms into the world with a wide field of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:20">[02:20:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:24">[02:43:24]</a>. This technology aims to revolutionize social interactions, allowing for holographic presence where one person might be physically present and the other appears as a full-body hologram, enabling interaction, work, and even games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. This represents the next major computing platform after phones, moving towards more ubiquitous, natural, and social interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.

The "sense of presence" is seen as the "Holy Grail" of social apps and experiences, offering a deep feeling of being physically present with another person that current technologies don't provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:34">[01:13:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:02">[01:20:02]</a>. While full physical touch (haptics) remains a significant challenge, progress is being made, particularly with hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. The focus is on creating a convincing illusion of presence, where technical flaws (like low field of view, latency, or unrealistic physics) break the immersion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>. Interestingly, people can accept mixed realities, such as photorealistic avatars in cartoon worlds or vice-versa, as long as the avatars' movements feel authentic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

### The Challenge of Declining Social Connection
Despite technological advancements aimed at connection, data suggests a decline in real-world social interaction. The average American has fewer friends than 15 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>, and time spent socializing in person has dropped by nearly 30% over the last 20 years for adults, and nearly 70% for ages 15-24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. The percentage of Americans reporting no close friends has jumped from 3% to 12% in 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.

Zuckerberg believes this decline is due to complex socioeconomic and social trends that largely predate modern technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. He argues that digital connections, particularly with AR glasses, will not replace physical interaction but will *add* to existing connections, such as enabling more frequent interaction with family members living far away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. He sees this as a way to meet the unfulfilled demand for social interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.

## [[AI and its implications for society and global competition | AI and its Implications for Society]]

The second pillar of the future is personalized [[machine_learning_and_its_impact_on_ai_development | AI]], which becomes compelling when it has context about an individual's life and surroundings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:31">[01:32:31]</a>. Glasses are considered the ideal form factor for this, as they can "see what you see and hear what you hear," gathering crucial sensory information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

### The Spectrum of AI Assistance: Struggle vs. Muscle Building
A key discussion point is whether [[AI and its implications for society and global competition | AI]] should remove "struggle" or if some struggles are essential for human development.

*   **Removing Struggle**: Examples like real-time universal translation are seen as beneficial, as they measurably unlock humanity by removing barriers between people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Meta's Ray-Ban Meta glasses already offer real-time translation in users' ears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:18">[03:18:18]</a>.
*   **Building a Muscle**: There are areas, particularly in education, where struggle is integral to learning and development, like building a muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:23">[02:25:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
    *   **Emotional Articulation**: [[AI]] could help people articulate emotions, but the act of struggling to communicate is also important for personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. Zuckerberg believes we will always find new things to struggle with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>, and [[AI]] tools will enhance, not eliminate, the pursuit of improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
    *   **Coding**: [[AI]] models are already helping with coding, enabling people to describe desired outcomes and build complex software more easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:05">[02:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:34">[02:37:34]</a>. While [[AI]] will handle much of the code production, teaching kids to program is still important as it teaches rigorous thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. This is analogous to using a calculator but still understanding basic math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:08">[02:09:08]</a>.
    *   **Language Learning**: [[AI]] translation will reduce the functional need to learn multiple languages, but language study still offers valuable insights into culture and the structure of one's own language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. People will need to prioritize what they learn in a world with perfect translation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

### [[Future of AI development and opensource considerations | AI's Impact on Social Media and Creativity]]
[[Generative AI]] is expected to profoundly change social media by providing powerful tools to users and creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:03">[03:03:03]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Content Creation**: Friends will create funnier memes and more interesting content, potentially with [[AI]] assistance to edit and highlight captured moments from glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. Creators will use advanced [[AI]] tools to make more compelling content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.
*   **Purely Generated Content**: In the [[the_future_advancements_in_ai_beyond_art_generation | future of AI applications]], there may be content purely generated by the system, personalized for the user, summarizing information, or simply producing entertaining material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.
*   **[[The ethical and economic implications of AIgenerated art | AI Creators and Creator AI Versions]]**: [[AI]] creators may emerge, and human creators will build [[AI]] versions of themselves. These [[AI]] artifacts can interact with communities, serving as "interactive sculptures" trained with specific contexts and topics, allowing creators to scale their engagement beyond their limited hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:52">[03:33:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

## [[Potential risks and benefits of AI | Concerns and Optimism]]
The pace of change driven by [[AI]] is a source of uncertainty and anxiety for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. While [[AI]] offers amazing new tools for hobbies and jobs, potentially leading to better work and lives, it also demands that individuals keep up with new trends to remain competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

To prepare for this future, Zuckerberg advises maintaining curiosity and digging into new technologies to live better lives, rather than resisting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:09">[03:09:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. He emphasizes that technological evolution is ongoing, and the current period of change is not unprecedented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

### The Open Source Debate
There's a significant debate within the [[future_of_robotics_and_ai_applications | AI]] field regarding open source development.

*   **Diversity vs. Concentration**: Some companies, like OpenAI and Google, aim to build one dominant [[AI]] system (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini). Zuckerberg, however, believes the future will have many different [[AI]] systems, much like there are many different apps and websites. He argues that every business will have its own [[AI]] for customer interaction and support, and creators will have personalized [[AI]]s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. Open source allows for this diversity, enabling anyone to modify and build upon [[AI]] models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.
*   **Safety Concerns**: A central part of the debate concerns [[specification_gaming_and_potential_ethical_challenges_in_ai | AI safety]]. Some argue that keeping models closed makes them safer by preventing "bad developers" from misusing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.
*   **Open Source as Safer**: Zuckerberg counters that historically, open-source software has proven safer and more secure. This is because public scrutiny allows more people to identify and fix bugs and security issues faster. The continuous release of updated, safer versions (like Llama 3.1, Llama 3.2) benefits everyone. He believes open source will lead to a more prosperous and safer future for [[AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.

## The Biggest Unanswered Question: Scaling of AI Architectures

One of the biggest open questions in the [[future_of_robotics_and_ai_applications | AI]] field is how far current transformer-based architectures can scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:17">[04:41:17]</a>. Unlike past [[AI]] architectures that hit plateaus, these new systems haven't found an end to their scaling capabilities with increased data and compute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:25">[04:44:25]</a>. Meta is making significant investments (hundreds of billions of dollars) in infrastructure based on the bet that this scaling will continue for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.

It's possible that a limit will eventually be reached, slowing down fundamental [[AI]] advances and shifting focus to product development. However, Zuckerberg is betting that [[AI]] will continue to advance rapidly, leading to compelling new products and a dynamic technological landscape for at least the next 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. This question is considered one of the most significant for the industry and global technology today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

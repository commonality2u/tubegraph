From: [[⁨cleoabram⁩]] <br/> 

The show "Huge If True" has spent two years exploring new ideas and [[emerging_technologies_impacting_the_future | new technologies]] that could [[exploring_potential_future_solutions_to_global_challenges | change the world]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Examples include humanoid robots, quantum computers, new supersonic planes, and particle colliders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The core belief behind this exploration is that by envisioning better futures, humanity makes them more likely to come true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Introducing "Huge Conversations"

The host has engaged in [[interviews_with_tech_innovators_shaping_the_future | conversations with some of the most important people building these tools]] – individuals whose visions of the future could soon impact billions of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. To share these discussions more comprehensively, a new format, "Huge Conversations," has been introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This series features longer, more in-depth, and optimistic conversations with people whose ideas are [[interviews_with_tech_innovators_shaping_the_future | shaping the future]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## A Different Approach to Tech Interviews

The goal of "Huge Conversations" differs significantly from many traditional [[interviews_with_tech_innovators_shaping_the_future | interviews with people building tech]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. While much media focuses on past failures or potential future setbacks, this new series is interested in the opposite question: "What if they succeed?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

> "A lot of media asks how have they failed in the past? Or what if they fail in the future? I'm interested in the opposite question: What if they succeed?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>

Success in [[challenges_and_successes_in_technological_progress | technological progress]] has the potential to change things for the better and solve many important problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. It's acknowledged that some of humanity's biggest challenges today are a product of progress and success, rather than failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## The Role of Optimism in Understanding the Future

The series aims to prompt leading innovators to paint a picture of the future they are building, grappling with both its promise and its perils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. An optimistic lens is considered essential to truly engage with these visions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. While the host may not always agree with the specific future painted, the intention is to clearly present these imaginings so viewers can decide if they wish to contribute to that future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

"Huge Conversations" is designed for those who want to understand what the most important people building the future are envisioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

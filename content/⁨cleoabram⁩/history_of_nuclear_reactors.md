The perception of "nuclear waste" often conjures images of glowing green goo in yellow barrels, hazardous and requiring storage for hundreds of thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This long-term storage presents a significant challenge and is a frequent point of contention in discussions about nuclear energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

However, historical developments in nuclear reactor technology reveal a different potential for this material.

## Early Innovations: The 1962 Nuclear Waste Recycling Reactor

In 1962, [[Argonne National Laboratory | Argonne National Laboratory]] developed a nuclear reactor that was designed to make electricity specifically out of [[nuclear_waste_as_energy | nuclear waste]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This innovative design led to predictions that by the year 2000, more than half of the country's electric power would come from atomic sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

Despite these early predictions, the United States today does not reuse any of its [[nuclear_waste_as_energy | nuclear waste]], allowing it to pile up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. If this technology were to be widely implemented, it would transform [[nuclear_waste_as_energy | nuclear waste]] from a hazardous byproduct into an "incredible clean energy resource" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Understanding Nuclear Fuel and Waste

Most power plants convert heat into steam to spin a turbine, which then generates electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. In nuclear power, this heat comes from splitting atoms inside special rocks, primarily uranium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

Only a small fraction, less than one percent, of natural uranium is "Uranium-235," the fissionable isotope that can sustain a nuclear reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Uranium undergoes an "enrichment" process to increase the concentration of Uranium-235 relative to the less useful Uranium-238 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. The fuel is then formed into small pellets, roughly the size of a fingertip, which are placed into long metal rods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

During a nuclear reaction, neutrons are fired at Uranium-235, splitting it into smaller, unstable atoms and releasing more neutrons, creating a chain reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This process converts a small amount of mass into energy, making the rods hot, which heats water to spin a turbine and generate electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

After approximately four to six years, enough Uranium-235 has been consumed that the reaction becomes inefficient, and the spent fuel is then classified as high-level nuclear waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. This waste consists of leftover Uranium-238, some residual Uranium-235, and various unstable atoms that emit ionizing radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. This radiation can be highly dangerous and remains radioactive for an "insanely long time," sometimes hundreds of thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

Currently, most nuclear waste in the U.S. is stored in dry casks, designed to last for decades but not for the hundreds of thousands of years required for the radioactivity to dissipate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. This approach is known as the "once-through" fuel cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

## The Promise of Nuclear Waste Recycling

The key to addressing the nuclear waste problem lies in filtering out the still-useful materials from the actual waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. [[Argonne National Laboratory | Argonne National Laboratory]] remains one of the few places in the U.S. still testing nuclear waste recycling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

The recycling process involves:
1.  Cutting up the nuclear waste into small pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
2.  Dissolving these pieces in a vat of molten salts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
3.  Running electricity through the vat to separate uranium and other useful materials from the waste, creating deposits on the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
4.  Making new fuel rods from these deposits and returning them to a reactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

This recycling can be done multiple times, not only generating more electricity but also significantly reducing the time the remaining waste is radioactive—from hundreds of thousands of years down to hundreds of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

This process enables a [[closed_nuclear_fuel_cycle | closed nuclear fuel cycle]]: Uranium is mined, used in a reactor, useful materials are filtered out and reused, potentially multiple times, before the greatly reduced amount of waste is placed into much shorter-term, manageable storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Some countries, like Japan, already implement such cycles to reduce reliance on imported fuel, conserve uranium, and mitigate waste radioactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

Estimates suggest that existing used fuel in the U.S. alone could power the country for the next 150 years if recycled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. The technology for this is already available, lacking only commercial facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Historical Setback in the United States

The U.S. stopped nuclear recycling in 1977 under President Jimmy Carter, due to concerns about nuclear proliferation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Plutonium, a highly radioactive element separated during recycling, was seen as a major proliferation risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Carter asserted that a viable nuclear power program could exist without reprocessing and recycling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

Consequently, the U.S. shifted away from "fast reactors," which could handle nuclear waste, towards "light water reactors," which are common today and cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

While President Reagan lifted the ban on nuclear recycling in 1981, as the ban was no longer seen as effective against proliferation, companies had already invested in the light water reactor technology that couldn't recycle fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. The prevailing argument became that nuclear fuel recycling was too costly and uneconomical compared to cheap and plentiful new uranium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

## Renewed Interest and Future Outlook

Today, incentives are changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Concerns about global conflict impacting fuel supply and the urgent need for more clean energy are prompting a re-evaluation of this technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

Companies like Oklo are actively working with [[Argonne National Laboratory | Argonne National Laboratory]] on new types of nuclear reactors designed to recycle existing [[nuclear_waste_as_energy | nuclear waste]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. The technology for [[challenges_and_future_of_nuclear_recycling | nuclear recycling]] is not a dream; it has been demonstrated and proven before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. The primary obstacle is commercialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

By overcoming past fears and leveraging existing resources and ingenuity, the recycling of [[nuclear_waste_as_energy | nuclear waste]] could play a significant role in achieving a sustainable clean energy future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

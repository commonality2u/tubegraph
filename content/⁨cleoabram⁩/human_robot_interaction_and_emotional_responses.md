The concept of human-like machines has long captivated the human imagination, from fictional characters like C3PO and Sonny from "I, Robot" to The Iron Giant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This fascination has driven significant advancements in the field of [[humanoid_robots_and_quantum_computers | humanoid robots]], leading to complex interactions and unexpected emotional responses from humans.

## The Allure of Humanoid Forms

Companies such as [[Development of Humanoid Robots by Companies | Tesla]], [[Development of Humanoid Robots by Companies | Boston Dynamics]], [[Development of Humanoid Robots by Companies | Honda]], and [[Development of Humanoid Robots by Companies | NASA]], alongside numerous startups, are making substantial progress in developing [[humanoid_robots_and_quantum_computers | humanoid robots]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. A primary reason for building robots in a human shape is that our world is constructed for humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. A [[humanoid_robots_and_quantum_computers | humanoid form factor]] is advantageous for systems intended to address current automation limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. These robots are designed to perform tasks deemed unsafe, repetitive, or boring for humans, including certain manufacturing processes or work in hard-to-access locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## Unpacking Human Assumptions and Moravec's Paradox

Humans often make subconscious assumptions about robots based on their appearance or impressive capabilities. If a robot can perform a complex task like a backflip, one might assume it can also do simple tasks like jogging slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. However, this is not always the case, as highlighted by [[Challenges in Human Like Robotics Movement | Moravec's Paradox]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This principle in robotics states that "the easy things are hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. What humans take for granted in movement and object interaction is extremely difficult for robots to replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. For example, while [[Development of Humanoid Robots by Companies | Boston Dynamics]]' Atlas robot can execute a backflip, it struggles with a seemingly simple task like sitting in a chair due to the complexity of writing a general control system for such behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

[!INFO] Don't make assumptions about robots!
If a person performs an impressive soccer shot, it's reasonable to assume they're also good at dribbling. But if a robot does it, those other skills might not be true at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Emotional Responses to Humanoid Robots

The human resemblance of [[humanoid_robots_and_quantum_computers | humanoid robots]] fundamentally changes how people perceive and interact with them.

> "Obviously I know that Atlas is not a person. But we're people, so it's just inevitable that we respond differently to robots that look like us as opposed to say an automated forklift." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>

This often leads to anthropomorphism, where individuals project human-like qualities and emotions onto the robots. The subconscious belief is that if a robot looks more like us, it must also think and behave more like us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

This phenomenon can elicit strong emotional responses, even guilt. When deliberately pushing the Atlas robot, the interviewer expressed feelings of guilt and concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, acknowledging: "I feel something when I push a [[humanoid_robots_and_quantum_computers | humanoid robot]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Similarly, witnessing [[Development of Humanoid Robots by Companies | Tesla]]'s Optimus robot seamlessly correct a fallen block or adapt to its blocks being moved evoked empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

## Societal Implications and [[Ethical Considerations in Robotics and AI | Ethical Considerations]]

As [[humanoid_robots_and_quantum_computers | humanoid robots]] become more integrated into daily life, society will undergo a significant "learning experience" in adapting to these systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. The unique emotional impact of these robots means that discussions around their purpose and ethical use are crucial.

[!WARNING] The "Killer Robot" Scenario
There are concerns about [[Ethical Considerations in Robotics and AI | weaponization]] of general purpose robots. [[Development of Humanoid Robots by Companies | Boston Dynamics]] has issued a statement that "no general purpose robots should be weaponized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a> and has collaborated with Massachusetts legislators to ban such technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. Elon Musk also expresses a desire to avoid a "terminator scenario" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

The development of [[humanoid_robots_and_quantum_computers | humanoid robots]] is seen by many developers as a way to make a positive impact, allowing people to choose what kind of work they want to do and having machines handle the tasks humans don't want to perform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

## Conclusion

[[Humanoid_robots_and_quantum_computers | Humanoid robots]] are inherently different from other types of robots (e.g., static or wheeled machines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. Their human-like appearance makes them both "more scary and more lovable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>, representing an ambitious technological pursuit to create in "our own image" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

As [[humanoid_robots_and_quantum_computers | humanoid robots]] become more capable—assisting with daily tasks like groceries or building, and performing feats beyond human capability like entering burning buildings or walking unprotected on the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>—society will face the urgent question of what humans want to do and what they are willing to give up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. The future of robotics is coming, and its ultimate form will be decided by humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

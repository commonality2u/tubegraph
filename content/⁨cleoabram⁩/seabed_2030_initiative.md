The ocean, which covers 71% of Earth's surface, remains largely unmapped in detail, with less known about its floor than the surface of Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. While Mars has been mapped to a resolution of 5 meters per pixel, and Earth's land to 30 centimeters, most of our oceans are mapped at a resolution of only 1.5 kilometers – 300 times less detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This lack of detailed data is a significant problem, given the ocean's constant use for [[underwater_internet_cables | internet cables]], global trade, food, and military operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

Mapping the ocean floor presents unique [[challenges_of_mapping_the_ocean_floor | challenges]], primarily due to its immense depth and the inability of light to penetrate deep waters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Early attempts, like those by Marie Tharp using sonar data from shipping routes, provided foundational but often generalized maps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Much of the topography seen on current maps, such as Google Maps, is derived from satellite gravity data, which estimates the seabed's shape based on subtle variations in the ocean's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. As marine scientist Steve Hall explains, this method provides a "pretty good approximation" but often relies on "educated guesswork" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

## The Goal of Seabed 2030

Recognizing the critical need for a comprehensive map, the international group "Seabed 2030" was established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Their ambitious goal is to map the entire ocean floor in detail by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. The aim is to achieve a resolution of 800 meters for the most unknown areas and down to a few meters for higher-traffic regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

This initiative is driven by the [[importance_of_detailed_ocean_mapping | importance of detailed ocean mapping]] for various reasons:
*   Better navigation in the deep ocean for activities like laying [[underwater_internet_cables | internet cables]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   Saving lives by improving predictions for tsunamis, storms, and sea level rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   Enabling the use of the ocean for new kinds of [[future_of_energy_independence_and_renewable_resources | renewable energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   Aiding in crisis situations, as demonstrated by the search for MH370, which revealed previously unmapped mountain ranges and valleys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

## How Seabed 2030 is Different

Seabed 2030 stands out due to two key strategies:

### Data from New Sources
The initiative is gathering data from a wide array of sources, including oil and gas companies, environmental groups, and even militaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. While some sensitive areas, like approaches to naval harbors, might only be shared at a lower resolution, any new data contributes significantly to improving the overall map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

### Leveraging Advanced Technology
Seabed 2030 heavily relies on [[technological_advancements_in_ocean_mapping | technological advancements in ocean mapping]]:
*   **Robots:** Unmanned underwater robots and autonomous underwater vehicles are deployed for mapping, performing repetitive tasks like "mowing the lawn" – going back and forth to collect measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This work is tedious for human crews but ideal for robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** AI is anticipated to further enhance mapping by allowing robots to intelligently spot and investigate interesting features with higher accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

## Progress to Date

When the Seabed 2030 project began, only 6% of the ocean floor had detailed maps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. As of the video's recording, this figure has increased to 25%, indicating substantial progress toward the 2030 goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

## Addressing Concerns about Data Use

Some express concern that detailed maps might lead to destruction, particularly if valuable minerals are discovered for mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. However, Steve Hall argues that the absence of a map is not a barrier to mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a> "You can't manage what you haven't measured and a map, whether it's a map of the land or a map of the seabed, it kind of puts you all on the level playing field."

Ultimately, humanity's ability to map its environment is a fundamental step toward understanding it and hopefully using that knowledge for the betterment of the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

## Broader Implications and Vision

The exploration of the ocean floor, one of the last unknown places on Earth, is described as an "awesome" endeavor that countries can undertake together, much like the International Space Station fosters collaboration despite political differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. Despite the ocean's terrifying immensity and humanity's physical limitations, technology, curiosity, and grit allow us to explore this "different world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. The knowledge gained from these detailed maps is expected to push the world forward and contribute to [[exploring_potential_future_solutions_to_global_challenges | exploring potential future solutions to global challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

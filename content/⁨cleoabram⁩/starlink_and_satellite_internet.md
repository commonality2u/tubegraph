Recent years have seen a significant push by billionaires like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos (Project Kuiper), and Richard Branson (OneWeb) to launch internet infrastructure into space, leading to what is known as the [[the_great_internet_space_race | Great Internet Space Race]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. These initiatives aim to provide fast internet access globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. [[the_great_internet_space_race | Starlink]], Elon Musk's satellite internet service, has already gained traction, notably becoming available in Ukraine during a conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Current Internet Infrastructure

For most people, the internet is not in space but rather underwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The internet's foundation relies on a vast network of over 800,000 miles of cables criss-crossing oceans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. As of 2021, approximately 436 such cables were in service, carrying up to 99% of current international internet traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

These cables transmit information as flashes of light, representing binary "1s and 0s" (on and off) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Imagine turning a flashlight on and off in code down a tube, millions of times faster through a tiny glass fiber across an ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

Laying these cables is an arduous process, taking weeks for ships to slowly cross oceans, dropping cable off the back of the boat at speeds of about 6 knots (7 miles per hour) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. These "fire hose-lookin' things" rest on the ocean floor, even in deep trenches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Cable-laying companies confirm they lay enough cable to reach the deepest parts, avoiding the most profound areas where possible due to difficulty and cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

Despite the common perception that the internet is "in the cloud" or "in space," given terms like "upload" and "download" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, the existing infrastructure is a marvel of human ingenuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Bandwidth and Latency

To understand internet performance, two key terms are important:
*   **Bandwidth**: The width of the "pipe," or how much information can go through in a set period, measured in megabits per second (Mbps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. A "bit" is one of those 1s or 0s; for example, 400 Megabits represents 419,430,400 1s and 0s per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Latency**: The "length of the pipe," or the time it takes for an information stream to travel from one end to the other, measured in milliseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

Better internet has high bandwidth and low latency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Historically, fiber optic cables have generally offered faster, cheaper, and more reliable service than satellite internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

## Why Satellite Internet?

While existing internet infrastructure is impressive, it is insufficient to meet global needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. [[challenges_of_existing_internet_infrastructure | Challenges of existing internet infrastructure]] include:
*   **Difficulty in cable laying**: Some places are prohibitively difficult to lay cables in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Threats from politics or war**: Crucial ground-based service can be threatened, as seen in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Financial viability**: Companies may not find it financially worthwhile to lay cable in rural areas where fewer people would pay for service, leading to higher costs where service is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

These issues contribute to the [[digital_divide_and_accessibility_of_internet | Digital Divide]], which describes the disparity in internet access globally and within countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. For example, US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) data, based on self-reported information from internet service providers (ISPs), significantly underestimates the number of people without fast internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. ISPs can count an entire census block as having service if just one person in that block has broadband <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This highlights that the problem of accessibility and affordability is often underestimated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

The goal of new satellite internet projects is to make internet access less dependent on location and cost, serving the approximately 4 billion people on Earth who currently lack broadband <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. This represents a significant business opportunity, estimated at $30 billion per year for broadband providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

## Satellite Internet Technology

The concept of communications satellites dates back to Telstar 1, launched in 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. While fiber optic cables convert 1s and 0s into visible light, satellites convert this information into radio waves for transmission up and down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. This conversion happens by changing the amplitude (height) or frequency (length) of the waves to represent binary code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

Older satellite systems, such as HughesNet and Viasat, use satellites placed very high up and stationary over one spot, allowing them to cover vast areas (e.g., HughesNet Jupiter 2 covers the entire continental United States) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. However, this high altitude leads to significant latency due to the long travel time for radio waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

The new generation of satellite internet projects, including [[the_great_internet_space_race | Starlink]], Project Kuiper, and OneWeb, mitigate this by placing satellites in lower Earth orbits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. While this requires more satellites to cover the same area, it significantly reduces latency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. Among these, [[the_great_internet_space_race | Starlink]] is currently leading the race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

## Starlink's Advantages and Limitations

[[the_great_internet_space_race | Starlink]] already offers surprisingly high bandwidth and low latency for a satellite system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. Costs are in a middle range, but comparisons are difficult given that fiber isn't universally available and [[the_great_internet_space_race | Starlink]] is still in its early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Current limitations for users include interruptions from obstacles like trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

A significant advantage of [[the_great_internet_space_race | Starlink]] is its use of visible light communication between satellites, similar to ocean fiber cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. Light travels faster in a vacuum (space) than through materials like glass cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. This means [[the_great_internet_space_race | Starlink]] has the potential to challenge fiber optics in terms of speed, though fiber is still expected to dominate in most areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

### Challenges and Criticisms

A major concern with the proliferation of satellite constellations is their [[impact_of_starlink_on_groundbased_astronomy | impact on ground-based astronomy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. The sheer number of satellites (potentially tens of thousands) in low Earth orbit poses a threat to observing the universe and to planetary defense efforts against asteroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. Solutions are needed to allow both internet access and astronomical observation, such as sharing satellite data or implementing regulations on their placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

## Future Impact and Vision

The new satellite systems hold the potential to provide better, faster, and cheaper internet globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. They have already proven crucial in crisis situations, as demonstrated by [[the_great_internet_space_race | Starlink]]'s activation in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

The true societal impact of these [[technological_advancements_and_future_potential | technological advancements and future potential]] comes when technology makes services not only faster and better but also cheaper, turning luxuries into widely available commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. Expanding internet access is linked to:
*   Job growth and new business formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.
*   Reduced unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.
*   Improved health outcomes and educational access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.

New satellite systems, alongside continued investment in existing infrastructure, are a significant part of addressing these needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. The internet, already a testament to human creativity and desire to connect, continues to evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

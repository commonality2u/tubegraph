Recent years have seen a surge in efforts by billionaires like Elon Musk (Starlink), Jeff Bezos (Project Kuiper), and Richard Branson (OneWeb) to launch internet services from space, initiating what is known as the [[The Great Internet Space Race | Great Internet Space Race]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. These initiatives aim to provide high-speed internet access globally and could fundamentally change how millions connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## The Current Internet Landscape: Under the Ocean

Despite common perceptions that the internet resides in "the cloud" or space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, the vast majority of current international internet traffic travels through [[Underwater Internet Cables | underwater internet cables]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### A Network of Light

As of 2021, approximately 436 active cables, spanning over 800,000 miles, crisscross the world's oceans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. These cables transmit information as flashes of light, representing binary "1s and 0s" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### Laying the Deep-Sea Internet

Specialized ships are used to lay these cables across oceans, traveling slowly at about 6 knots (7 miles per hour) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The process can take weeks, with the cable slowly dropping off the back of the boat to weave a literal web around the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

Even in the deepest ocean trenches, these cables are laid along the seafloor rather than suspended, though engineers try to avoid the very deepest parts due to cost and difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This intricate infrastructure allows for the unimaginable volume of data exchanged constantly across the globe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## The Satellite Internet Vision

The concept of communications satellites dates back to Telstar 1, launched in 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. While fiber optic cables use visible light to transmit data, satellites convert binary information into radio waves for transmission to and from space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. This conversion involves modulating wave properties like amplitude or frequency to represent 1s and 0s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### Bandwidth and Latency

Two key metrics define internet performance:
*   **Bandwidth**: The amount of data that can pass through in a set period (e.g., Megabits per second) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. A "bit" is a single 1 or 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Latency**: The time it takes for data to travel from one end to another, measured in milliseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

Generally, high bandwidth and low latency provide better internet service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Historically, traditional satellite internet (using satellites in high orbits) has been slower, more expensive, and less reliable than fiber optic cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. However, this dynamic is changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Addressing the [[Digital Divide and Internet Accessibility | Digital Divide]]

The primary motivation behind new satellite internet projects is to overcome the limitations of existing infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Many people worldwide lack access to good internet, often due to the prohibitive cost or difficulty of laying cables in certain areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Political instability or war can also threaten ground-based services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>, as seen in Ukraine where Starlink service was activated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

This global and regional disparity in internet access, often underestimated by official data (e.g., the US FCC's method of counting an entire census block as "served" if one provider covers any part of it) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, is known as the [[Digital Divide and Internet Accessibility | Digital Divide]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. It presents both an accessibility and affordability problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

Companies like Starlink aim to serve these "hardest to serve customers" and achieve "broadband everywhere," including for the roughly 4 billion people currently without internet access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. This represents a significant business opportunity, as providing broadband is estimated to be a $30 billion per year industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

## The New Generation: Low-Earth Orbit Satellites

Unlike older systems that use a few high-altitude, stationary satellites to cover large areas (leading to high latency) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, new projects like Starlink, Project Kuiper, and OneWeb deploy thousands of satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. While this requires more satellites to cover the same area, it significantly reduces latency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

### Starlink's Progress

Elon Musk's Starlink is currently leading this race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>, having already launched many satellites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Starlink provides a user kit with a satellite dish, router, and simple setup: "Point at sky, plug in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

Starlink boasts surprisingly high bandwidth and low latency for a satellite system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. It is still in its infancy, and challenges remain, such as signal interruption from trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

Notably, Starlink satellites use visible light for inter-satellite communication, similar to fiber optic cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. This gives them a potential advantage over cables because light travels faster in the vacuum of space than through glass fiber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. While Starlink could challenge fiber in some areas, fiber is expected to remain dominant in most places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Outlook

### [[Impacts of Satellite Internet on Astronomy | Impact on Astronomy]]

The proliferation of thousands of satellites in low-Earth orbit poses a significant threat to [[Impacts of Satellite Internet on Astronomy | ground-based astronomy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. These satellites can interfere with observations crucial for understanding the universe and for planetary defense against asteroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. It is imperative to find ways to provide internet access to everyone while preserving the ability to study the cosmos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

### Transforming Society

Satellite internet systems, like Starlink, are already proving vital in crisis situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>, such as in Ukraine where Starlink provides crucial connectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

The true societal impact will be realized if these technologies make internet service not only better and faster but also **cheaper** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. By turning a luxury into a commodity accessible to everyone, satellite internet could mirror historical advancements that made goods like refrigerators and iPhones widely available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.

Increased internet access correlates with job growth, new business formation, lower unemployment, and improved health and education outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. While existing internet infrastructure is a testament to human ingenuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>, new satellite systems are poised to play a huge role in its continued evolution and expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

Image-generating artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as DALL-E and DALL-E 2, are capable of creating entirely new images from text prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Unlike traditional methods that collage existing pictures, these [[technological_advances_enabling_ai_capabilities | technological advances]] generate original works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This capability has sparked both excitement and [[the_ethical_and_economic_implications_of_aigenerated_art | controversy]], particularly among artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. However, these tools are ultimately a new part of an old history where [[technological_advances_enabling_ai_capabilities | technology]] helps people bring their creative visions to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. When used effectively, [[AI as a tool for creativity and expression | AI as a tool for creativity and expression]] can unlock more human creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Mastering the "Magic" of AI Prompts

Using AI image generators can evoke an "incredible giddy feeling," akin to discovering one is a wizard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. While basic prompts yield impressive results, such as "astronaut riding a skateboard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, mastery lies in specificity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Adding details like "a photo of a yellow astronaut riding a skateboard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a> or modifying elements ("with the head of a duck") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a> significantly refines the output. Users can also dictate artistic styles, such as "a banana riding a skateboard painted by Van Gogh" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. The community has even developed tools like Excel spreadsheets to help construct elaborate prompts, including "main idea," "sub ideas," "do not includes," "aspect ratio," "camera type," "lighting," and "colors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. An example of a detailed prompt is: "A poster of a banana riding a skateboard, high definition, bright lighting, vibrant colors, 1950-1960 Pop Art" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## How AI Image Generation Works: CLIP and unCLIP

DALL-E 2, one of the most prominent AI image generation tools, is composed of two primary [[technological_advances_enabling_ai_capabilities | technologies]]: CLIP and unCLIP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

*   **CLIP:** This model is trained on a vast dataset of images and their corresponding captions, often collected from the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. CLIP learns the intersection of visual information and linguistic information, understanding concepts like aesthetics, style, and what a caption would typically describe in an image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. When a prompt is given, DALL-E 2 first generates CLIP's conceptual understanding of what the image should contain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   **unCLIP:** This component takes CLIP's conceptual understanding, the original text prompt, and adds "noise" to generate various image options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

This process differs fundamentally from simple collaging. Instead of combining existing images, AI tools like DALL-E 2 retain information about style, colors, and other attributes to create something new based on that understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

## The Experiment: Artists Gaining Superpowers

To test the impact of AI on different artistic skill levels, a competition was held between an experienced designer and animator (Justin) and a non-artist (the narrator) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The challenge was to create a digital art piece of the New York City skyline, first without AI, and then with AI, each within a 30-minute limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Over 3,000 people voted on the results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### Round 1: Without AI

Both participants used collage techniques, assembling parts of existing creations to make something new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. The non-artist felt limited by their known abilities and used their own photo of the NYC skyline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. The artist, Justin, used software parameters to create a detailed collage, acknowledging it felt like "cheating" but within the bounds of traditional software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### Round 2: With AI

With AI assistance, both participants explored diverse styles and concepts:

*   **Non-artist:** Experimented with "New York skyline made of mirrors and textiles" and "stained glass window" effects, then ventured into "New York City skyline painted in the style of Botticelli" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Artist (Justin):** Explored "Lego brick," "bananas," "kid drew it with crayon," "Studio Ghibli," "Leonardo DaVinci," and multiple "Van Gogh" styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

The public voting results were:
1.  Justin with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>
2.  Justin without AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>
3.  Non-artist with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>
4.  Non-artist without AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>

This outcome suggested that while AI boosted both individuals, it provided the non-artist with "new skills" and the artist with "superpowers," confirming the potential for [[AI as a tool for creativity and expression | AI to enhance creative output]] at various skill levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

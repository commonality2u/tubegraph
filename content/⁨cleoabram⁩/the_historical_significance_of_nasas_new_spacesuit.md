Only 12 people have ever walked on the Moon, all within just four years of each other, ending in 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. For 50 years, no one has returned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. However, this is set to change with astronauts returning to the Moon to prepare for long-term habitation and future missions to other planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. To achieve these ambitious goals, [[design_and_functionality_of_the_new_spacesuit_by_axiom_space | spacesuits]] need a significant upgrade, as the ones for the Moon have not been updated in decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This new generation of suits will enable astronauts to accomplish more for longer periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## The Artemis III Mission: A New Era of Lunar Exploration

The upcoming Artemis III mission, slated for 2026, marks humanity's return to the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Four astronauts will embark on a multi-day journey, with two descending to the lunar surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Their planned stay of 6.5 days is twice as long as any previous lunar mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. A key objective is to explore the lunar south pole, a region never before visited by humans, in search of vital resources like water and metals crucial for future Moon habitation and Mars missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

To achieve these prolonged stays and explorations, astronauts require:
*   Ability to remain on the lunar surface longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   Enhanced protection against extreme heat and cold, especially in permanently shaded regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   Greater [[improvements_in_mobility_and_flexibility_for_astronauts | flexibility and range of motion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   Suits designed to fit a wider variety of body types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Axiom Space: Outsourcing a Critical Component

For the first time, NASA has outsourced the production of its next-generation spacesuits to Axiom Space, replacing their aging and outdated designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Axiom Space is building the Artemis III spacesuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This partnership reflects a major transition in how space missions are approached, emphasizing sustainability and broader access to space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## The Evolution of Spacesuits: From Clothing to Human-Shaped Spacecraft

Spacesuits are not merely high-tech clothing; they are "one-person human-shaped spacecraft" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. They provide an atmosphere, oxygen, and pressure, essential for survival in the vacuum of space, where conditions like zero pressure, extreme temperature fluctuations, and radiation pose lethal threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

Historically, spacesuits fall into two main categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>:
*   **Launch and Entry Suits:** Designed to protect astronauts during ascent and re-entry in case of cabin depressurization, acting as a personal atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Early Mercury program suits were primarily high-altitude protective gear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Suits:** Also known as Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMU), these suits enable astronauts to work outside a spacecraft, whether on the lunar surface or in low Earth orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### Key Innovations of the New Spacesuit

The Axiom Space prototype represents a significant leap forward in [[design_and_functionality_of_the_new_spacesuit_by_axiom_space | spacesuit design]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. It incorporates decades of advancements in various scientific and engineering fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

*   **Layered Construction:** The suit consists of three main sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>:
    *   **Inner Bladder Layer:** Holds the internal pressure and oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
    *   **Restraint Layer:** Prevents the bladder from over-inflating and defines the suit's movement capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. This layer is crucial for [[improvements_in_mobility_and_flexibility_for_astronauts | astronaut mobility]], requiring specific training for movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
    *   **Outer Insulation Layer:** Protects against extreme temperatures (e.g., 150°C in sunlight to -150°C in shade on the Moon), radiation, and physical damage from dust and debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. The white color is essential for reflecting light to maintain coolness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. The boots feature proprietary insulation to protect against the extremely cold lunar surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.

*   **Modularity and Fit:** Unlike previous Apollo suits, which were custom-designed and expensive, the new suits are modular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. They use small, medium, and large base options with interchangeable pieces, allowing them to fit 90% of men and women in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. This modularity opens the door to space for many more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

*   **Sustainability and [[cost_and_accessibility_considerations_of_nextgeneration_spacesuits | Cost Reduction]]:** Earlier EMUs were designed for short missions, requiring refurbishment back on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The new suit is designed from the ground up for maintenance on orbit or during missions, making it much more sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. While 1970s NASA suits reportedly cost $150 million in today's dollars, Axiom received $228 million for the new model's development with plans to reduce per-suit costs with increased production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

*   **Enhanced Mobility:** The suit significantly [[improvements_in_mobility_and_flexibility_for_astronauts | improves mobility]], allowing actions previously impossible in full EVA suits, such as kneeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. This flexibility is crucial for tasks like collecting samples, conducting research, and traversing the lunar surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.

*   **Handcrafted Precision:** Despite advanced technology, much of the suit's assembly, particularly the precise stitching, is done by hand, ensuring meticulous quality control and safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

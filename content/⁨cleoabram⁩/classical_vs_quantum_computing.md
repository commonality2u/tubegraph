[[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | Quantum computers]] are a fundamentally different technology from classical computers, rather than just being bigger or faster versions of what we currently use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Understanding this difference is key to grasping their significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Fundamental Differences

### Bits vs. Qubits
Classical computers operate on "bits," which are made of pieces of silicon and can exist in one of two states: zero or one (ground state or excited state) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. All information, from words to numbers to colors, is translated into this binary computer language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

In contrast, [[Qubits and how they function | quantum computers]] run on [[Qubits and how they function | qubits]], which are more complex than simple ones or zeros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. A [[Qubits and how they function | qubit]] can be thought of like a wave, with a probability of being zero (lower energy wave) or one (higher energy wave) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. When a [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computer]] is running, the probabilities of multiple [[Qubits and how they function | qubits]] interact constructively or destructively, much like waves in a pond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

### Calculation Methods
Classical computers process information in a very binary way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. A common misconception about [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computers]] is that they "try all the options" simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Instead, a [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computer]] observes how these [[Qubits and how they function | qubit]]-waves interact and then determines the most likely answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

This fundamental difference in how they calculate means that [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computers]] excel at different types of problems than classical computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Physicality and Operation
A [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computer]] is primarily a dilution refrigerator designed to keep the [[Qubits and how they function | quantum computer]] chip extremely cold—around 15 millikelvin, which is colder than outer space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Cables run through this refrigerator to the processor, carrying signals for the [[Qubits and how they function | qubits]] to perform their quantum operations, which are then converted into human-understandable information by room-temperature control electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## Strengths and [[Potential applications of quantum computing | Applications]]

[[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | Quantum computers]] are not faster at *everything* than classical computers; for instance, they are not ideal for simple addition, a task perfectly suited for a calculator or phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Their strength lies in finding structure within vast amounts of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

Key [[potential_applications_of_quantum_computing | applications]] include:

*   **Simulating Nature**: Nature itself is fundamentally quantum, operating under the laws of quantum physics at the molecular and atomic levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Classical computers struggle to calculate how materials or atoms will behave at a certain size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | Quantum computers]] are expected to revolutionize fields like battery technology development, creation of new materials with long molecular chains, and new medicines by better predicting molecular behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **[[Quantum computers and encryption | Encryption]]**: One of the most significant early [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computer]] algorithms is Shor's Algorithm, which can find prime factors for very large numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. This is critical because RSA [[quantum_computers_and_encryption | encryption]], the basis for most internet transactions, relies on the classical impossibility of cracking these large numbers by brute force within billions of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. A [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computer]] could potentially do this in hours to days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. This has spurred a global race, although current [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computers]] (e.g., IBM's 433 [[Qubits and how they function | qubits]]) are not yet powerful enough for this task, which would require a million or more [[Qubits and how they function | qubits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

## The Transportation Analogy

A helpful analogy describes classical and [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computers]] as different modes of transportation across a mathematical map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

> Imagine a video game map where travel depends on mathematical ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
> *   **No Computers**: You walk across the map with pencil and paper, slow and unable to explore many areas due to computational limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
> *   **Early Computers**: Like riding horses, allowing faster travel and access to previously unreachable areas by processing larger data sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
> *   **Modern Classical Computers**: Represented by cars on roads, enabling even faster and easier exploration of more complex mathematical problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
>
> The key insight is that [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computers]] are *not* faster cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. They are like **boats** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. A boat isn't inherently better than a car; it's designed for entirely different terrain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | Quantum computers]] allow navigation of "new mathematical waters," solving problems and discovering areas inaccessible to traditional computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This analogy helps explain why a [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computer]] will likely never "beat" an iPhone for everyday tasks, as they are built for different purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

The analogy can be further adjusted to a **submarine**, suggesting different levels and depths of exploration in a "bottomless ocean" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. As the technology improves with no inherent physical limits, new [[potential_applications_of_quantum_computing | applications]] not yet considered will likely be discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

## Future Outlook
The progress in [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computing]] is incredibly fast, with problems being solved that were thought impossible just a couple of years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Experts are confident that if the physics allows it, engineers will find a way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. A significant shift towards [[quantum_computers_and_encryption | quantum-safe algorithms]] for [[quantum_computers_and_encryption | encryption]] is anticipated within five years or even less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. This gradual transition will likely see the replacement of current standards like RSA [[quantum_computers_and_encryption | encryption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

The ultimate goal is to develop technology that enables fundamentally different and better things, and to better understand the world around us, which is inherently quantum mechanical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes that [[ai_and_its_implications_for_society_and_global_competition | AI]] will fundamentally alter the landscape of social media and content creation, impacting nearly every field and feature of applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>.

## AI's Impact on Social Media Evolution

Social media initially focused on interactions between friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>. This has already shifted significantly, with at least half of content now originating from creators or content not personally known to the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>. Zuckerberg anticipates that [[ai_and_its_implications_for_society_and_global_competition | AI]] will further accelerate this trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>.

> [!INFO] Key Shifts
> *   **Tools for Users:** Friends will be able to create funnier memes and more interesting content with [[ai_as_a_tool_for_creativity_and_expression | AI tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>. For instance, [[ai_as_a_tool_for_creativity_and_expression | AI]] could automatically edit captured content from glasses to make it more engaging or highlight interesting moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>.
> *   **Tools for Creators:** Professional creators will leverage advanced [[ai_as_a_tool_for_creativity_and_expression | AI tools]] to produce even more compelling content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>.
> *   **Purely AI-Generated Content:** The future may include content purely generated by [[ai_and_its_implications_for_society_and_global_competition | AI]], personalized for the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>. This could involve summarizing information or creating humorous content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>.
> *   **AI Creators & Avatars:** There will be [[the_impact_of_ai_on_traditional_artistry | AI creators]] and existing creators will build [[the_impact_of_ai_on_traditional_artistry | AI versions of themselves]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>.

## Empowering Creators with AI Artifacts

One significant challenge for creators is the limited time they have to interact with their communities, despite nearly unlimited demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. Zuckerberg suggests that [[ai_as_a_tool_for_creativity_and_expression | AI]] can address this by enabling creators to produce "AI artifacts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.

These [[ai_as_a_tool_for_creativity_and_expression | AI]] artifacts are described as pieces of "digital art" or "interactive sculptures" that the community can engage with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>. Creators can train these [[ai_as_a_tool_for_creativity_and_expression | AI]]s with specific contexts, topics, and boundaries, allowing the community to interact with a representation of the creator even when the actual person is unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>.

## Concerns and the Pace of Change

The rapid [[technological_advances_enabling_ai_capabilities | pace of change]] in [[ai_and_its_implications_for_society_and_global_competition | AI]] development is a legitimate concern, bringing uncertainty about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>. While [[ai_as_a_tool_for_creativity_and_expression | AI tools]] promise to enhance quality of work and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>, professionals, especially creators in competitive spaces, will need to continuously adapt to new trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>. The unknown nature of these upcoming changes can induce anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] The "Struggle" in Development
> Some concerns revolve around whether [[ai_and_its_implications_for_society_and_global_competition | AI]] will remove beneficial struggles, such as learning a language or articulating emotions, that contribute to human development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>. However, Zuckerberg argues that new challenges will emerge, similar to how coding has evolved from low-level systems to higher-level application building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>. [[The creative potential unlocked by AI tools | AI]] could enable children to describe and build complex software, shifting the struggle from syntax to iterative refinement of their creative vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>.

> [!IMPORTANT] Educational Implications
> Zuckerberg reflects on the [[educational_and_societal_implications_of_ai_advancements | educational implications]] of [[ai_and_its_implications_for_society_and_global_competition | AI]], drawing an analogy to calculators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. While [[ai_as_a_tool_for_creativity_and_expression | AI]] will offer powerful tools, he suggests that learning to code will remain important for developing rigorous thinking, even if [[ai_as_a_tool_for_creativity_and_expression | AI]] handles most code production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>. Similarly, learning languages might become less functionally relevant due to universal translators, but still offers insights into different cultures and the structure of one's own language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>.

## Open Source and Safety Debates

Meta's approach to [[ai_and_its_implications_for_society_and_global_competition | AI]] development, particularly with models like Llama, emphasizes open source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:23">[00:39:23]</a>. This contrasts with companies aiming to build a single, centralized [[ai_and_its_implications_for_society_and_global_competition | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>.

> [!INFO] Open Source Philosophy
> Zuckerberg believes that the future will involve many different [[ai_and_its_implications_for_society_and_global_competition | AI systems]], much like there are many different apps and websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>. Every business and many creators are expected to have their own [[ai_and_its_implications_for_society_and_global_competition | AI]] to interact with customers or communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>. Open source allows widespread modification and building upon [[ai_and_its_implications_for_society_and_global_competition | AI models]], fostering a richer, more diverse ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>.

The [[the_ethical_and_economic_implications_of_aigenerated_art | safety debate]] around open source [[ai_and_its_implications_for_society_and_global_competition | AI]] involves the concern that making models widely available could allow "bad developers" to misuse them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>. However, historical precedent with open source software suggests the opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>. Open source often leads to safer and more secure software because wider scrutiny helps identify and fix issues quicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:14">[00:42:14]</a>. This continuous feedback loop results in smarter and safer [[ai_and_its_implications_for_society_and_global_competition | AI models]] for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:18">[00:43:18]</a>.

## The Future of AI Scaling

A significant open question in the [[the_future_advancements_in_ai_beyond_art_generation | AI field]] is how far the current transformer-based architectures can scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>. Unlike previous [[ai_and_its_implications_for_society_and_global_competition | AI]] architectures that plateaued, current models haven't yet found their limit in terms of data and compute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:25">[00:44:25]</a>.

Companies like Meta are making massive investments (hundreds of billions of dollars) in infrastructure based on the belief that [[ai_and_its_implications_for_society_and_global_competition | AI]] will continue to scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">[00:45:42]</a>. While it's possible that a scaling limit will eventually be reached, requiring new fundamental architectural improvements, Zuckerberg's bet is that [[ai_and_its_implications_for_society_and_global_competition | AI]] will continue advancing significantly for quite some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>. This continued advancement promises dynamic technological landscapes and compelling new products over the next two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>.

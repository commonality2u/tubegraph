Researchers are exploring the use of [[genetic_engineering_in_trees_to_capture_more_co2 | genetic engineering]] to help mitigate [[the_potential_role_of_genetically_modified_trees_in_combating_climate_change | climate change]], specifically by developing "supertrees" that can capture more carbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This initiative aims to strengthen one of humanity's key allies in the fight against a "man-made disaster of global scale" driven by increased carbon dioxide and other emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## How Supertrees Work

Photosynthesis-enhanced trees are being engineered by a company led by CEO Maddie Hall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. The core of their work involves incorporating new genes from other plants into tree cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. These plant cells are grown on "selection media" to encourage the growth of cells that have successfully integrated the new genes, eventually forming shoots and roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

The goal is to make the process of photosynthesis more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. A key enzyme in photosynthesis, "rubisco," sometimes picks up oxygen instead of carbon dioxide, leading to "photorespiration" which wastes energy and releases carbon dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. By altering the expression of genes that control this process, scientists can improve the efficiency of photosynthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.

The genetic alteration is performed using a "gene gun," a device that coats gold particles with DNA fragments and then shoots them into plant cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. This method incorporates new genes into the plant cell's genome without using bacteria, which is advantageous from a regulatory perspective as it avoids introducing non-plant pest genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

Early results show that some seedlings with these [[potential_genetic_enhancements_and_their_implications | genetic enhancements]] exhibit enhanced photosynthesis and a higher rate of [[genetic_engineering_in_trees_to_capture_more_co2 | carbon]] assimilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. This indicates the possibility of meaningfully increasing the amount of [[genetic_engineering_in_trees_to_capture_more_co2 | carbon]] trees can absorb from the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

## Rationale for Altering Trees

One of the primary questions is why alter trees when more trees can simply be planted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. Patrick, a co-founder of the company, explains that planting a trillion trees would be necessary to account for anthropogenic human carbon emissions if the trees' ability to draw down carbon isn't increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. By enhancing their carbon capture ability, the required number of trees could be reduced, potentially to a little over 500 billion, representing a significant reduction in planting effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. Even a small change in an individual [[ethical_and_ecological_implications_of_using_genetically_modified_organisms_for_climate_intervention | organism]] can magnify significantly when applied to a large number of [[ethical_and_ecological_implications_of_using_genetically_modified_organisms_for_climate_intervention | organisms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.

### Carbon Cycle Dynamics

When trees take in [[genetic_engineering_in_trees_to_capture_more_co2 | carbon dioxide]] for photosynthesis, it reduces the amount of [[genetic_engineering_in_trees_to_capture_more_co2 | carbon dioxide]] in the surrounding air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. However, when leaves fall or trees die and decompose, much of that [[genetic_engineering_in_trees_to_capture_more_co2 | carbon]] is released back into the atmosphere within a few years, a process known as the "fast" carbon cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. This is why famous graphs measuring [[genetic_engineering_in_trees_to_capture_more_co2 | carbon dioxide]] concentrations show an annual zigzag pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.

In contrast, burning fossil fuels introduces extra [[genetic_engineering_in_trees_to_capture_more_co2 | CO2]] from deep underground, representing the "slow" carbon cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>. Therefore, merely planting trees that only participate in the fast carbon cycle is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. Efforts are needed across various solutions, and if trees are planted, they need to do "more of this" (referring to trapping more carbon long-term) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. In theory, trees that can trap more [[genetic_engineering_in_trees_to_capture_more_co2 | carbon]] could be a significant help if the [[genetic_engineering_in_trees_to_capture_more_co2 | carbon]] then gets trapped long-term through decay and burial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>.

## Addressing Concerns: Invasive Species and Native Plants

A common concern with [[ethical_and_ecological_implications_of_using_genetically_modified_organisms_for_climate_intervention | genetic engineering]] for plants released into the wild is the potential for them to become [[challenges_and_considerations_of_planting_genetically_altered_trees | invasive species]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. Maddie Hall emphasizes that their work on photosynthesis enhancement is not intended for a single species to be planted at scale everywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>. Instead, the company focuses on enhancing species native to specific environments, such as loblolly pine in Southeastern Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. Planting non-native trees, even [[challenges_and_considerations_of_planting_genetically_altered_trees | genetically unaltered kind]], can negatively impact the carbon problem by disrupting the delicate balance of local ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>.

The company's broader vision is not to be the sole provider of [[the_potential_role_of_genetically_modified_trees_in_combating_climate_change | genetically engineered trees]] but to serve as an example of how scientists can enhance photosynthesis in native plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. They have publicly shared their research on photosynthetic efficiency to inspire other groups globally to improve tree growth rates and carbon capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>.

## Physical Characteristics and Future Plans

While an [[the_potential_role_of_genetically_modified_trees_in_combating_climate_change | genetically engineered tree]] seedling may appear larger than an un-altered one of the same age, indicating a "supertree" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>, Patrick clarifies that there is no evidence yet that the final adult size of the trees will be different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. The enhanced trees accumulate biomass more quickly, meaning they reach their mature size faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>.

The company, Living Carbon, is on the cusp of becoming a commercial tree-planting operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>. By the end of 2023, they aim to scale their planting capacity from 2.6 million to over 10 million trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>. This represents the first commercial planting of a photosynthesis-enhanced organism at a commercial scale in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>. This effort is seen not as a complete solution to [[the_potential_role_of_genetically_modified_trees_in_combating_climate_change | climate change]] but as a significant beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>.

## The Huge Vision: Regulating the Atmosphere

The ultimate vision behind this work is humanity taking on the unprecedented responsibility of deliberately and continuously regulating the atmosphere of the planet for the benefit of all living things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. Patrick notes that humans are not the first species to destabilize the atmosphere; for example, the evolution of algae produced oxygen, causing a mass extinction event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. Living Carbon represents a recognition that in the future, humans will need to be the species that regulates the atmosphere's composition for the biosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>. This implies a future where humanity might establish a "Subcommittee for Survival" or a "Ministry for the Continuation of Life on Earth" to manage global atmospheric conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>.

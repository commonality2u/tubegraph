The concept of artificial wombs, once confined to science fiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, has recently sparked significant public and scientific debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The discussion intensified following a Twitter exchange involving Elon Musk, who raised concerns about population collapse, and other figures who suggested artificial wombs as a potential solution to the "burden on women" that pregnancy entails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This idea met with both strong support and fierce opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Current State of Research

While the idea of full artificial wombs for humans remains far off, significant [[scientific_advancements_in_egg_and_embryo_preservation | scientific advancements in egg and embryo preservation]] and related fields are being made:

### Dr. Jacob Hanna's Mouse Embryo Research
Dr. Jacob Hanna and his team have achieved a groundbreaking feat by successfully growing mouse embryos outside the uterus for an extended period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Until their study, mouse embryos could only be grown to the blastocyst stage outside the uterus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This early stage is already utilized in IVF, where human embryos are grown in a lab before being implanted into the uterus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

Hanna's team focused on the subsequent phase of development, when most organs are formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. They proved that this critical part of mammal development, previously thought to require a uterus for organ formation, can indeed occur in an artificial environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This represents a major leap in understanding early development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Other Studies
Other research has also contributed to this field, notably a famous study involving a lamb. In this experiment, a lamb fetus was grown outside the womb for a month during the latter two-thirds of its pregnancy, long after its organs had formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

These advancements highlight that the quest for artificial wombs isn't a single "new technology," but rather the "slow movement of science" with incremental progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. However, we are still far from developing full artificial wombs for humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## The Debate: Harm vs. Good

The [[Ethical debates surrounding artificial reproduction | Ethical debates surrounding artificial reproduction]] surrounding artificial wombs often center on whether such technology would do more harm or more good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### Arguments Against
Critics argue that investing in artificial womb research is a "big distraction" from more immediate needs, such as parental leave and affordable childcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Concerns also exist about potential misuse, including the control of reproduction or the manufacturing of children in "factories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Some believe that pregnancy is a special and important experience that technology could never replicate, nor should it try to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### Arguments For
Proponents emphasize that pregnancy carries significant risks, with childbirth claiming the lives of over 800 women daily worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. They also point out that pregnancy can hinder women's careers, contributing to the wage gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Additionally, a significant percentage of women (30-45%) report childbirth as traumatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. For many, an artificial womb is seen as a "dream come true" that could "change the lives of many people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

The personal experience of potentially losing an ovary due to severe cysts, requiring surgery to preserve the ability to have biological children, shifted the narrator's perspective on the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This medical experience underscored the pain and risk inherent in processes related to biological reproduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. Pregnancy is acknowledged as "incredibly hard" and "superhuman," with unique challenges due to human anatomy, including narrow hips and large brains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. The narrator concluded that they would "totally use an artificial womb" if available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Why Artificial Womb Research is Crucial (Beyond Full Artificial Wombs)

The broader debate often frames the issue as "artificial wombs versus pregnancy," overlooking the crucial, near-term benefits of this research for supporting pregnancy and human health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

### 1. Helping Premature Babies Survive
Research into artificial womb environments can significantly improve the survival rates of premature babies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. By developing new tools and [[Technological advancements in pregnancy and childbirth | technologies]], such as advanced incubators and "liquid ventilation," these systems could provide extremely premature infants with an opportunity to develop their lungs in a fluid environment, much like inside a mother's womb, thereby saving lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

### 2. Growing Organs for Organ Transplants
A primary motivation for Dr. Hanna's research is the development of organs for transplantation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Over 106,000 people are on organ transplant waiting lists in the U.S. alone, with 17 dying daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. A major challenge is organ rejection, which occurs in 5-40% of transplants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. The dream is to be able to grow patient-specific organs from their own cells, eliminating the need for donors and preventing rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. This research is vital for understanding organ development to achieve this goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

### 3. Learning About Human Development
Studying human (or any mammal) development in utero is incredibly challenging, often described as a "black box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. While ultrasounds and invasive procedures provide snapshots, they don't allow for continuous observation of embryo development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. The ability to observe mammalian embryos developing outside the uterus, similar to how zebra fish embryos are studied, offers an unprecedented opportunity to learn about the intricate processes of life formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

## Conclusion

Ultimately, the development of artificial wombs, even in their most extreme form, would likely exist as an option rather than a replacement for natural pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. The historical controversy surrounding IVF, which was once deemed "immoral" and "Hitlerian" by some, serves as a parallel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

Inspired by a doctor's quote that "there is an obligation to relieve suffering when the means to do so are available, or in the absence of the means, to search for the means" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>, the case is made for continued research. This pursuit aims to provide future generations with "more options, and less risk, and less pain" in having children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

The success of a [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] team extends beyond the engineering and design of the cars, heavily relying on intricate strategies and advanced simulations.

## Design and Development Strategy
Winning in [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] starts at the factory with how a car is built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Teams must design and manufacture their own cars based on strict regulations provided by the FIA and F1, which dictate the car's appearance and shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Within these rules, teams fiercely compete to find the optimal design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The goal for every [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] team is to create the two fastest cars possible within these rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, allowing their drivers to outperform other teams and win the Constructors' Championship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### Continuous Testing and Iteration
Teams constantly test their designs through various methods:
*   **Computer simulations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>
*   **Physical rigs** that mimic a moving car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>
*   **Large wind tunnels** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>
    *   Due to [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] limitations on full-size car testing in wind tunnels, teams build and test 60% scale versions of their cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

The car is never truly "done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>; a team continuously learns, changes, and rebuilds between every single race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.

## Race Strategy and Real-time Decision Making
During a race, strategies are continuously developed and adapted.

### Tire Management
Choosing the correct tires at the opportune moment is a significant aspect of a team's race strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. Teams have options for hard, medium, and soft tires, or different wet tires for rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. Soft tires provide the most grip but wear out fastest, while hard tires are the opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. Drivers communicate when their tires are losing grip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>.

### Race Engineer and Strategy Team
Drivers communicate with their race engineer, who, in turn, is connected to a large team of strategists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. Most strategists are located back at the factory in a control room that resembles NASA's mission control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.

### Supercomputer Simulations
These strategists utilize supercomputers to run millions of simulations throughout a race on the Oracle cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. These simulations factor in various real-time data points:
*   Weather conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>
*   Brake temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>
*   Tire performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>
*   Actions of every other driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>

The results of these simulations are fed back to the track in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. The aim is to win by determining the best course of action and anticipating or reacting to competitors' moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. This involves constant communication, with team members having dual headphones to hear conversations from both cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>.

## Balance of Technology and Human Skill
A winning [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] car is not only about the [[engineering_and_technology_in_formula_1 | technology]] within the car but also the [[technological_innovations_in_electric_racing | technology]] guiding every move it makes on the track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>. Despite the vast resources of strategists, supercomputers, and simulations, the ultimate outcome still depends on human skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. Drivers must possess the capacity to focus and process information while simultaneously operating the car at high speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.

The entire process, from design to build, paint, simulation, and testing, is a continuous cycle of refinement, highlighting how [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] cars are a testament to human ingenuity and collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.

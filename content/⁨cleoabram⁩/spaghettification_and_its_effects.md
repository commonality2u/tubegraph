Spaghettification is a term used to describe a dramatic stretching and squashing effect experienced when an object, such as a human, falls into a black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This phenomenon occurs due to the extreme gravitational forces present near a black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## How it Occurs

The core reason for spaghettification is that the distortion in spacetime is not constant over the length of a body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. As an object approaches a black hole, the gravitational pull on the part of the object closer to the black hole (e.g., the feet) is significantly stronger than the pull on the part farther away (e.g., the head) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## The Physical Effects

The differential gravitational force causes the object to stretch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. In addition to stretching, there is also a squashing effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. As an object gets closer to the singularity (the infinitely dense point at the center of a black hole), these stretching and squashing effects become increasingly extreme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

Ultimately, the forces become so immense that the object "cease[s] to stay together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Initially, the body might be stretched into a long string of atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. As the process continues, even the atoms themselves get separated, followed by the protons and the quarks inside the protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. Eventually, "everything is gone, everything's been ripped apart!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. All the ripped-apart pieces continue to race inward toward the singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

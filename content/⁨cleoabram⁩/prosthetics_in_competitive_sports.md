The integration of prosthetics in competitive sports has sparked a significant [[debate_on_technology_in_sports | debate on technology in sports]], questioning when athletic gear, or even body modifications, offer an unfair advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. This discussion extends to the core of what constitutes "cheating" and how to maintain the spirit of sport while acknowledging [[technology_advancements_in_sports_tracking_and_data_collection | technological advancements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Case Studies: Oscar Pistorius and Blake Leeper

### Oscar Pistorius
Oscar Pistorius was a groundbreaking figure, becoming the first person to qualify for and compete in the Olympics using running blades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. His participation ignited conversations globally about what is fair and unfair in sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

### Blake Leeper's Challenge
Eight years after Pistorius, Blake Leeper qualified for the Olympics with the fifth-fastest time in the world against able-bodied athletes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. However, he was "abruptly stopped" from competing, leading him to take his case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. The Olympic committee decided to revisit the rules regarding running blades, despite having allowed Pistorius previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

The central question became: If athletes are allowed to wear prescription glasses to correct a disability, aren't prosthetics the same in principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>? This highlights the difficulty in defining what constitutes a "correction" versus an "enhancement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

## Testing and Arguments
Extensive tests were conducted on Leeper's blades to assess their spring compression and energy return compared to natural legs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Researchers concluded that his prosthetic legs did not make him faster at sprinting or improve his endurance, though they did hinder his acceleration and ability to round curves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

Opponents argued that prosthetics could offer advantages by being lighter and not requiring the body's oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. However, the pivotal issue for Leeper's case was the "Max Allowable Standing Height" (MASH) rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. This rule, which was not applied to Pistorius, stipulated that Leeper's blades made him taller than his theoretical natural height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. His theoretical height was calculated using measurements from other parts of his body, based on small studies primarily of white and Asian men, despite Leeper being born without the lower part of his legs and never having a natural full height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. Ultimately, Leeper was told he had to reduce the height of his legs by six inches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>, which would fundamentally change his running mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

## Ethical and Philosophical Questions
This case underscores the complex [[ethical_and_philosophical_questions_surrounding_technology_in_sports | ethical and philosophical questions surrounding technology in sports]]. The core concern appears to be a "fear or a concern that technology will get so good people on blades will actually outperform everybody" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. Blake Leeper himself acknowledged that the debate was not about his individual competition, but about the "Pandora's Box that it could potentially open up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

The broader implication is about the [[ethics_of_technological_advancements_in_athletics | ethics of technological advancements in athletics]] and how far technology should be allowed to push human capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. While technology aims to make lives easier and expand what's possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>, deciding the boundaries of this progress, particularly in sports, remains an ongoing debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. Some argue it is unethical to stop pushing human potential forward through invention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

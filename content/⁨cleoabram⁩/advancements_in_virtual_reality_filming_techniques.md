Modern video production has seen an explosion in complexity and realism, redefining how movies and other media are created. The distinction between what is real and what is not can be increasingly difficult to ascertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This shift is not confined to Hollywood, reaching platforms like YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. According to Marques Brownlee, the traditional rules of media creation have been rewritten, allowing for unprecedented creative freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Studios like ZeroSpace in New York offer access to cutting-edge technologies that are transforming film production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## [[xr_stage_technology_in_film_production | XR Stage Technology]]

One significant advancement is the [[xr_stage_technology_in_film_production | XR stage]], which evolves the concept of green screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### How [[xr_stage_technology_in_film_production | XR Stages]] Work

An [[xr_stage_technology_in_film_production | XR stage]] is essentially a massive LED wall capable of displaying any desired background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Unlike older "rear projection techniques" that used static images or videos behind actors, [[xr_stage_technology_in_film_production | XR stages]] address the "motion parallax" problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Motion parallax is the phenomenon where closer objects appear to shift at different speeds than those farther away when the camera moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The [[xr_stage_technology_in_film_production | XR stage]] solves this by creating a live virtual world in the background that precisely matches camera movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. A small gadget on top of the camera provides position information, allowing the virtual background to adjust perfectly and appear realistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Advantages Over Green Screen

While green and blue screens have been used for years, they pose a significant challenge known as "spill" – unwanted reflections of the screen's color on actors or props <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This is particularly problematic with reflective surfaces, requiring extensive post-production to remove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. The [[xr_stage_technology_in_film_production | XR stage]] eliminates green spill because the lighting is correct during shooting, regardless of how shiny the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This allows for realistic lighting and reflections that match the virtual environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

The [[xr_stage_technology_in_film_production | XR stage]] utilized by Disney's *The Mandalorian*, known as "The Volume," exemplifies these benefits, allowing for gorgeous reflections on Mando's reflective armor without needing to replace it with computer-generated (CG) armor in post-production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Richard Bluff, visual effects supervisor for *The Mandalorian*, noted that scenes like Mando walking into the safe house were ideal for the LED volume, as virtual walls and ceilings could cast realistic light and shadows on the characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Creative and Production Benefits

[[xr_stage_technology_in_film_production | XR stages]] allow filmmakers to blend real and virtual elements seamlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. They enable quick changes to backgrounds, such as altering the time of day, which significantly reduces production costs and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. For *The Mandalorian*, instead of 15-25 physical standing sets, only three physical locations were used per season, with the LED Volume allowing for different virtual sets to be loaded as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### Multi-Camera Capabilities

These LED walls can also display different content to multiple cameras simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. The wall refreshes at 120 frames per second (FPS), allowing two cameras to capture alternating 60 FPS streams, each seeing a different background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. This capability extends to up to six cameras, with the wall refreshing at a minimum of 180 FPS, enabling each camera to film at 30 FPS and see distinct virtual environments and correct reflections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

## [[motion_capture_and_performance_capture_in_movies | Motion Capture and Performance Capture]]

Another significant advancement is [[motion_capture_and_performance_capture_in_movies | motion capture]] (also known as performance capture) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This technology, seen in films like *Avatar* and *Planet of the Apes*, uses tracking markers on special suits to map an actor's movements to a digital character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Suits can have dozens of independent tracking orbs, monitored by multiple cameras, allowing for the creation of digital doubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

The reason actors in *Avatar 2* performed underwater while wearing [[motion_capture_and_performance_capture_in_movies | motion capture]] suits was to capture the "truest form of motion" for the scene, as the physics of movement in water cannot be accurately replicated outside of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Volumetric Video Capture

Volumetric video is an emerging technology that creates real-time 3D holograms of subjects by placing cameras around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. This allows creators to move themselves and the camera anywhere in the virtual space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. A key advantage is that no special suit or prior scanning is required; subjects are instantly turned into 3D holograms upon stepping into the capture volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. Even with only six cameras, a single virtual camera angle can be stitched together from the multiple inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

This technology represents an "added dimension of interactivity" for video, moving beyond 360-degree video by allowing viewers to explore beyond a flat sphere, such as looking *underneath* objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

## [[accessibility_of_advanced_video_production_techniques | Accessibility of Advanced Video Production Techniques]] and Future Implications

The [[accessibility_of_advanced_video_production_techniques | accessibility of advanced video production techniques]] is increasing rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. What was once cutting-edge technology for major film productions is becoming available to individuals, even with devices like iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

The widespread availability of [[motion_capture_and_performance_capture_in_movies | motion capture]] and digital doubles raises complex questions about intellectual property (IP), the role of actors, and the nature of creative work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. Digital doubles could allow actors to "act" in movies even in retirement or after they pass away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Similarly, a musician could have their choreographer dance as them in a music video, or a digital double could perform all the physical aspects of a YouTuber's content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. This blurs the lines between performance and replication, prompting discussions about whether audiences should be aware of a digital actor's presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

Concerns also arise regarding aging in the industry, as digital doubles could allow performers to maintain a youthful appearance indefinitely, potentially extending careers but also succumbing to societal pressures about age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

The [[impacts_of_video_technology_on_the_film_and_content_creation_industry | impacts of video technology on the film and content creation industry]] are profound, enabling creators to tell stories that were once nearly impossible, at unprecedented pace and budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. Ultimately, the power of these [[advancements_in_immersive_experiences | advancements in immersive experiences]] lies not just in the technology itself, but in how it is utilized to foster creativity and explore new narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

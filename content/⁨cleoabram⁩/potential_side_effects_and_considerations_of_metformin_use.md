[[metformins_effects_on_diabetes | Metformin]] is a widely used drug that has been prescribed for decades to effectively control blood sugar in people with diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. It is notably inexpensive, costing only pennies per pill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Recently, [[metformins_effects_on_diabetes | Metformin]] has gained popularity among other groups, including wealthy individuals, for its potential as an [[metformin_as_an_antiaging_drug | anti-aging drug]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## How Metformin Works

For individuals with diabetes, [[metformins_effects_on_diabetes | Metformin]] helps manage blood sugar levels, which can become too high after eating or drinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Extensive research on its mechanism for diabetes has been conducted for decades prior to its approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Potential Anti-Aging Applications

Dr. Nir Barzilai, an expert on aging, clarifies that the goal of anti-aging research is not to reverse aging, but to delay its effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, particularly the increased risk of death from common diseases like cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. He posits that the biology of aging drives these diseases, and by interrupting this biology, the diseases themselves might be stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The theory is that if the accumulation of bodily damage over time can be delayed, then associated diseases could also be delayed, potentially extending lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### The UK Study
In 2014, Dr. Barzilai encountered a UK study involving approximately 180,000 people that examined three groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>:
*   People with diabetes taking [[metformins_effects_on_diabetes | Metformin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>
*   People with diabetes taking other medications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>
*   People without diabetes not taking any diabetes drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>

The study found that people with diabetes *not* taking [[metformins_effects_on_diabetes | Metformin]] had double the mortality rate compared to people without diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Strikingly, people with diabetes who *were* taking [[metformins_effects_on_diabetes | Metformin]], despite being more obese and sicker to begin with, had *less* mortality than people without diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

### Caveats of Existing Studies
When considering [[metformins_effects_on_diabetes | Metformin]] for [[metformin_as_an_antiaging_drug | anti-aging]], significant caveats must be noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>:
*   **Correlation vs. Causation**: The UK study was retrospective, meaning it looked back at existing data. It could identify correlations but could not confirm that [[metformins_effects_on_diabetes | Metformin]] *caused* the reduced mortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Applicability to Non-Diabetics**: The study participants taking [[metformins_effects_on_diabetes | Metformin]] all had diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. It is currently unclear if the "dying less" effect applies to individuals without diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Limited Research Incentive**: Because [[metformins_effects_on_diabetes | Metformin]] is a cheap generic drug, there is less financial incentive for pharmaceutical companies to fund expensive new research into its [[metformin_as_an_antiaging_drug | anti-aging]] properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Animal Studies**: While some studies show [[metformins_effects_on_diabetes | Metformin]] having [[metformin_as_an_antiaging_drug | anti-aging]] effects in healthy mice and worms, more human research is needed to confirm its efficacy in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### The TAME Study
To address these limitations, Dr. Barzilai is leading the TAME (Targeting Aging with [[metformins_effects_on_diabetes | Metformin]]) study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This will be a randomized trial where half of the participants receive [[metformins_effects_on_diabetes | Metformin]] and the other half receive a placebo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. The primary goal of the TAME study is to collect data that would allow the FDA to approve [[metformins_effects_on_diabetes | Metformin]] for the purpose of targeting aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Side Effects of Metformin

[[metformins_effects_on_diabetes | Metformin]] does have common side effects, particularly during the first week of use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>:
*   **Early satiety**: Feeling full quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Upset stomach**: General gastrointestinal discomfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Diarrhea**: Loose stools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
*   **Impact on Exercise**: While exercising on [[metformins_effects_on_diabetes | Metformin]], muscle capacity will still increase, but the muscles may not become as large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## Personal Considerations for Use

Deciding whether to take [[metformins_effects_on_diabetes | Metformin]] for [[metformin_as_an_antiaging_drug | anti-aging]] purposes involves assessing three factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>:

1.  **Interpretation of Existing Studies**: Evaluating the current research findings, keeping in mind the limitations of retrospective studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The TAME trial's results are still pending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
2.  **Perceived Urgency of Aging**: This is a highly personal choice about how urgently one feels the need to address aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
3.  **Weighing Benefits Against Side Effects**: Considering whether the potential benefits of delaying aging outweigh the known side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

Some individuals, particularly those featured in the news, choose to take [[metformins_effects_on_diabetes | Metformin]] off-label for [[metformin_as_an_antiaging_drug | anti-aging]] by making a specific calculation: they are satisfied with current studies, tolerate the side effects, and feel a strong urgency about aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. However, it is strongly cautioned against taking medication based solely on media consumption, as expert medical advice is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Many, including journalists, prefer to wait for more definitive studies before considering [[metformins_effects_on_diabetes | Metformin]] for [[metformin_as_an_antiaging_drug | anti-aging]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

Regardless of [[metformins_effects_on_diabetes | Metformin]], ongoing research is exploring various drugs for their [[metformin_as_an_antiaging_drug | anti-aging]] potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Discovering any option that can meaningfully delay the effects of aging in most people would be a monumental breakthrough, given the millions who die annually from age-related diseases like heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

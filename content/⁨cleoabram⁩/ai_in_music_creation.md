AI is rapidly transforming the music industry, enabling the creation of new songs, generating lyrics and melodies, and even facilitating [[voice_cloning_with_ai | voice cloning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This technological shift is seen as a significant turning point for music, raising high stakes for how human musicians earn money and create art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The central debate revolves around two main questions: what can [[impact_of_ai_on_the_music_industry | AI music]] actually do, and when should artists be compensated in this new landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>?

## How AI is Changing Music Creation

AI allows individuals to create entirely new songs, including fake collaborations, or generate lyrics and melodies in seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The technology has advanced quickly, leading to discussions about whether AI will be "the death of music" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. However, if managed correctly, AI presents an opportunity for a significant leap in human self-expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Bridging the "Gap"

One perspective is that AI can help "shrink the gap"—the difference between a perfect idea in one's head and what can be realistically created with available tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Creativity and technical skill are often confused, but lowering the technical skill required to express creativity has historically led to more great music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. For example, centuries ago, creating a composition required being a musical genius like Mozart or Beethoven, with significant costs associated with testing ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Today, tools like computers, used by artists such as Avicii, have lowered this barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. AI is seen as a new, powerful tool in this progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

Artists can currently use AI tools like ChatGPT for lyrics or Google's MusicLM for new melodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. It's possible that AI-generated music is already present on platforms like Spotify without users knowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

### [[voice_cloning_with_ai | Voice Cloning]] and Artist Collaboration

A controversial use of AI is [[voice_cloning_with_ai | voice cloning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Artist Grimes has embraced this technology, releasing a tool called Elf Tech that allows anyone to change their voice into hers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. She plans to release a "competitive AI album" alongside her human-made album, featuring collaborations with other artists who use her AI voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. However, many artists are strongly against the unauthorized use of their voices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>, asserting the need for consent and copyright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## [[copyright_issues_with_aigenerated_music | Copyright and Compensation]] in the Age of AI

The music industry's existing rules for compensation depend on how it defines "inspiration" versus "copying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### Existing Rules and AI

*   **Inspiration:** Most music falls into the category of inspiration, where artists are influenced by others without needing to pay them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Direct Copying with Payment:**
    *   **Sampling:** Using a piece of an original recording or composition requires payment to the copyright holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
    *   **Interpolation:** Re-recording a line or melody from someone else's song requires paying the original composer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
    *   **Covering:** Re-recording an entire song requires payment to the owner of the original composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
    *   Grimes's approach to [[voice_cloning_with_ai | voice cloning]] fits here, as collaborators agree to pay her for using her voice and likeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

If AI is used to perform any of these actions, the existing copyright rules still apply, and payments are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. The copyright system protects both the original song recording (master) and its composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. This has led to numerous lawsuits over alleged copying, such as the "Blurred Lines" case (where Pharrell Williams and Robin Thicke had to pay for copying Marvin Gaye's composition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, and Ed Sheeran's successful defense against claims of copying a chord progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

### The AI-Specific Question: Training Data

A unique question specific to AI is whether artists should be paid if an AI trains on their music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. AI tools require thousands of songs for their training data sets, and companies are not always transparent about their sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Unlike sampling or interpolation, AI tools analyze patterns and create entirely new works rather than collaging existing music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

Currently, the industry's decision on compensation is based on the *output* of the music, not the *input* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Artists are paid if the final product sounds sufficiently like them, regardless of whether their music was used in its creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Changing this would involve compensating artists for "inspiration," a concept not currently formalized in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Daniel Ek, CEO of Spotify, believes that the output of AI training is more important than the input, emphasizing the need for new IP that doesn't draft off someone else's name and likeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

## The [[future_of_ai_as_a_tool_for_artists | Future of AI in Music]]

If AI becomes more autonomous, generating millions or even billions of songs, the question of who owns the intellectual property becomes much harder to determine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. While the AI itself wouldn't be treated as a creator, the person behind the AI likely would be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

Despite the complexities and [[challenges_and_concerns_of_ai_replacing_artists | concerns about AI replacing artists]], many believe that music is fundamentally human expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. If AI can serve as a tool to enhance this expression and help more people realize their musical talent, it presents a significant opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. The potential to unlock vast amounts of human expression currently "locked inside people's minds" is a compelling prospect for the [[impact_of_ai_on_human_creativity | future of music]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

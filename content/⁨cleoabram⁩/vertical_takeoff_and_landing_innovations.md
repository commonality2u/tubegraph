Recent advancements in battery technology are paving the way for a new era in aviation, particularly with electric aircraft capable of vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. This represents a significant shift from traditional aviation, offering solutions to environmental challenges and opening up new possibilities for air travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

## The Need for Better Planes
Air travel has profoundly transformed human connection and global trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. However, it is a significant contributor to CO2 emissions, which have risen dramatically within recent generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. To address this, there's a critical need to develop more sustainable aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. The good news is that the tools to achieve this are emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

## Beta Technologies and Electric VTOL
A company called Beta is at the forefront of building a new kind of electric airplane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Their aircraft is designed as an electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicle, combining features of both a helicopter and a plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.

### Evolution of Electric Flight
The concept of electric aviation isn't new; electric airships existed as early as 1883 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. Early designs, like one from 1883, used heavy batteries made of zinc and chlorine, demonstrating that the weight of batteries was a major hurdle for electric flight to compete with liquid fuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

### Battery Advancements
The primary obstacle for electric planes was the weight of batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. However, significant [[technological advancements and future potential | technological advancements]] in battery production have occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. Modern electric aircraft, like those from Beta, utilize the same lithium-ion cells found in Tesla vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. A single battery pack in Beta's aircraft holds the same amount of energy as a standard Tesla car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

When designing an aircraft, two key metrics for batteries are crucial:
*   **Volumetric energy density**: How much energy can be stored relative to its size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
*   **Gravimetric energy density (specific energy)**: How much energy can be stored relative to its weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

In 2010, batteries providing the same energy as aviation fuel would have required 50 times the weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. Unlike fuel, which burns off and lightens the plane during flight, batteries maintain their weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. However, over the last decade, batteries have become significantly smaller and, more critically for planes, lighter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. This [[future_potential_of_electric_planes | innovation]], seen in laptops, phones, and electric cars, is now being applied to electric planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. This includes not only improving individual batteries but also optimizing how densely they can be packed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. Furthermore, battery costs have dramatically decreased, facilitating greater investment in electric plane development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

### How VTOL Works with Electric Propulsion
While electric batteries are heavier than traditional fuel, electric motors are lighter and smaller, offering more flexibility in their placement on the aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. This synergy enables VTOL capabilities.

Instead of needing a runway, a VTOL aircraft can hover using multiple propellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. Once airborne, these propellers can stow, transforming the aircraft into a more conventional single-engine plane for forward flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>. This design allows for stable hovering and simplified flight control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.

## Benefits and Applications of VTOL
Vertical takeoff and landing capabilities open up aviation to new areas that currently lack airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>.

### Impact on Emissions
While large passenger planes are unlikely to be replaced by electric VTOL aircraft soon, these smaller planes can still make a substantial impact on emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. A significant portion of aviation emissions comes from short-haul flights (less than 1500 kilometers or 932 miles), which account for a third of passenger flight emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

Short flights contribute disproportionately to emissions because the extra fuel used during takeoff and landing constitutes a larger percentage of the flight's total fuel consumption compared to cruising. Additionally, less efficient planes are often used for shorter routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. By electrifying these short-distance flights, a significant reduction in overall aviation emissions can be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.

### Freight and Logistics
Beta is specifically focusing on freight applications for their electric VTOL aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. Freight delivery with VTOL has the potential to reduce carbon emissions from other sources, such as road transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. UPS has recognized this potential, signing a deal with Beta, as not relying on roads could revolutionize delivery logistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

## Looking to the Future
The development of electric VTOL aircraft signifies that the aviation industry can move into the future without waiting for distant breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. Considering the vast advancements in aeronautics since the 1940s, when a 1942 Stearman trainer was state-of-the-art, the potential for future aviation is immense despite current environmental, financial, and technological challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.

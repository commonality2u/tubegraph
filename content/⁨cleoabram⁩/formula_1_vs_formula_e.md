[[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] is a renowned car racing sport celebrated globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. It is viewed as a glimpse into the future of car [[engineering_and_technology_in_formula_1 | technology]], combining team and individual elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. However, a significant challenge has emerged as consumer vehicles increasingly become electric, while [[basics_of_formula_1_cars | Formula 1 cars]] have remained primarily fossil-fueled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## The Existential Challenge for Formula 1
Formula 1's significant financial investment and public attention stem from its role in advertising cutting-edge car [[engineering_and_technology_in_formula_1 | technology]] from major automotive companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The premise is to showcase superior car-building capabilities to encourage sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. If this [[formula_1s_impact_on_car_innovation_and_future_trends | technology]] becomes outdated, it risks losing its purpose and investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Governments worldwide are moving towards banning new gas car sales. California has implemented such a ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, and the entire European Union plans to follow suit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. By 2040, owning a car with a tailpipe might be akin to owning one with a car phone, as [[formula_1s_impact_on_car_innovation_and_future_trends | technology]] progresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This presents an existential moment for Formula 1, a sport meant to advertise the future of cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## The Birth of Formula E
The concept of [[electric_vehicles_in_racing | Formula E]] originated from a dinner in Paris 11 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Key attendees included:
*   **Alejandro Agag**: Spanish businessman and former member of the European Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Antonio Tajani**: Former European Commissioner for Transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Jean Todt**: President of the FIA, the governing body of Formula 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

During this dinner, the inevitability of electrification was discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Formula 1 could not simply switch to electric cars at the time because:
*   **Battery Limitations**: Eleven years ago, electric car batteries could not sustain the required 305 kilometers (190 miles) within a two-hour race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Manufacturer Readiness**: In 2011, most of F1's marquee car companies did not produce [[electric_vehicles_in_racing | electric vehicles]] and did not want the sport to change, reflecting a classic innovator's dilemma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

Instead, Jean Todt proposed creating a new, separate electric championship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This led to the creation of Formula E, envisioned as a "space program for [[electric_vehicles_in_racing | electric cars]]" to rapidly advance [[electric_vehicles_in_racing | technology]] for racing and future consumer cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. A crucial agreement was made: Formula E received an exclusive 25-year license for fully electric racing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This license, which began with Formula E's launch in 2014, expires in 2039, four years after the EU and California's bans on new gas car sales take effect in 2035 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This sets up a "collision course" between Formula 1 and Formula E <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Formula E's Unique Design and Rules
Formula E's creators aimed to build an entertaining sport while advancing [[electric_vehicles_in_racing | electric car]] [[engineering_and_technology_in_formula_1 | technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. They drew inspiration from video games like "Super Mario Kart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### Similarities to Formula 1
*   Each team has two drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   Drivers earn points based on their finishing position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   Teams win by accumulating the most total points, and individual drivers win with the most points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### Key Innovations and Differences
*   **City Center Racing**: Races take place in city centers, bringing the show closer to people and conveying that [[electric_vehicles_in_racing | electric cars]] are a solution for urban mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This makes races easily accessible and fan-friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Attack Mode**: Drivers can go off the racing line to activate "Attack Mode," which provides a temporary energy boost, similar to boosts in video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Fan Boost (Retired in 2023)**: Audiences could vote to give specific drivers a temporary speed boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. While this rule was retired in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, it exemplified Formula E's flexibility in incorporating "fun ideas" into racing, unlike Formula 1 which might consider them gimmicks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

## Technological Advancement in Formula E
Formula E acts as an experiment to advance [[electric_vehicles_in_racing | electric car]] [[formula_1s_impact_on_car_innovation_and_future_trends | technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. The progression of Formula E cars mirrors the improvement of consumer electric vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

*   **Gen 1 (First Formula E Car)**: Launched in 2014, these cars faced the common electric car problem of limited battery range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. The solution was to provide each driver with two cars, allowing for car swaps during pit stops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Gen 2**: Developed after four years, the Gen 2 car could complete an entire race on a single battery charge, effectively doubling the distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Gen 3**: The latest iteration, Gen 3, is the fastest and most powerful [[electric_vehicles_in_racing | electric race car]] ever built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
    *   **Standardized Components**: Unlike Formula 1, all Formula E teams use the same frame (chassis), battery, and most ancillary parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
    *   **Innovation Focus**: Teams concentrate their development on powertrain components that convert battery energy into speed, including the rear motor, inverter, gearbox, and associated software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. This design choice aims to control costs and direct experimentation towards the most critical [[electric_vehicles_in_racing | technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
    *   **Performance Improvements**: Gen 3 cars boast a significant power increase from 250 kilowatts to 350 kilowatts and are lighter, weighing about 850 kilograms compared to over 900 kilograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This results in greater speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
    *   **Regenerative Braking**: A major innovation in Gen 3 is the absence of rear mechanical brakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. The cars stop using the electric motors themselves, converting kinetic energy back into electrical energy to recharge the batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. This regenerative braking system can recuperate up to 80% of the energy back into the battery when braking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. While revolutionary and sometimes challenging during testing, this [[technology]] is expected to be adopted in future road vehicles, leading to increased range, faster charging, and cleaner driving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

## Formula 1's Shift to Hybrid
Around the time Formula E launched, Formula 1 announced significant rule changes, introducing a "technical revolution" and going "hybrid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Every F1 car is now powered by a hybrid powertrain, combining a turbo engine with two electric motors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. While Formula E holds the exclusive license for *purely* [[electric_vehicles_in_racing | electric racing]], Formula 1 can utilize hybrid [[technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. The next generation of Formula 1 [[future_developments_in_formula_1_engines | engines]] is approaching a 50/50 split between electric and fuel power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

## The Future of Car Racing
The fundamental question remains: if consumer cars are moving towards full electrification, should racing [[technology]] reflect that future? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. According to Alejandro Agag, if a championship cannot race the [[technology]] being sold to the public, there will be a disconnect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. Unlike horse racing, where horses are not illegal, combustion cars are projected to become illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. The future of car racing might involve a merger between Formula 1 and Formula E, or one acquiring the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. Regardless, both sports are actively working to develop better car [[technology]] for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

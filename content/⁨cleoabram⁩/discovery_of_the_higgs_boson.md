The [[Large Hadron Collider LHC at CERN | Large Hadron Collider (LHC)]], located on the border between France and Switzerland, is the largest science experiment ever constructed, comprising a 27 km long tunnel over 100 meters underground [00:00:00]. Inside this tunnel, scientists accelerate particles smaller than atoms in opposite directions to nearly the speed of light, smashing them together [00:00:21]. This massive undertaking took thousands of people from over 100 countries, $5 billion, and over 30 years to plan and build [00:00:37].

### The Standard Model and the Predicted Higgs Boson
The [[Large Hadron Collider LHC at CERN | LHC]] was built to help understand the universe by studying elementary particles, the fundamental building blocks of everything [00:07:53]. Much of our current understanding is described by a framework called the [[Purpose and significance of particle colliders | Standard Model]] [00:08:17].

A key reason for building the [[Large Hadron Collider LHC at CERN | Large Hadron Collider]] was that the [[Purpose and significance of particle colliders | Standard Model]] predicted the existence of a mystery particle, the Higgs Boson, also sensationally known as the "God Particle," which was thought to be present near the beginning of our universe but had never been detected [00:08:38]. The [[Purpose and significance of particle colliders | Standard Model]] suggested the Higgs Boson was "of vital importance to universal existence" [00:08:52] because it would confirm the existence of an underlying field that gives other particles mass [00:09:03]. Essentially, the Higgs Boson would help explain "why stuff exists" [00:09:10].

### The Search and Discovery
To detect the Higgs Boson, scientists needed to generate enough energy in one place to create it, which could be achieved by smashing two protons together at nearly the speed of light [00:09:27]. This was a primary motivation for constructing the [[Large Hadron Collider LHC at CERN | LHC]] [00:09:34].

After the [[Large Hadron Collider LHC at CERN | LHC]] was built, thousands of scientists spent two years collecting data at two different detectors [00:09:41]. They then announced that they had reliably created the Higgs Boson, a particle never before detected, thereby proving a previously unknown truth about our universe [00:09:56]. The proof of its existence was observed as a "bump on a chart" [00:10:07]. Scientists, through mathematical predictions, had anticipated that if the Higgs Boson existed, a bump would appear when particles were smashed together [00:10:18]. This bump indicated that "more particles [were] being produced at that energy" [00:10:25], confirming that the math was correct [00:10:29].

### Significance and Future Implications
The confirmation of the Higgs Boson's existence, while not immediately changing daily life, indicated that humanity is on the right track in understanding the universe [00:10:35]. The impact of discovering fundamental building blocks of reality is often not immediately apparent but paves the way for future advancements [00:10:43]. For instance, Isaac Newton could not have imagined humans on the moon centuries after his discoveries about planetary motion [00:10:48]. Similarly, better understanding how these particles work could lead to new technologies in 20, 30, or 50 years that change our lives [00:11:09].

The [[Large Hadron Collider LHC at CERN | LHC]]'s work has not only led to the Higgs Boson discovery but has also shaped our understanding of elementary particle interactions and rigorously tested existing theories about the world [00:11:27].

Despite these successes, some scientists believe the [[Large Hadron Collider LHC at CERN | LHC]] may have reached its learning limits, and there remains much unknown about the universe, such as dark matter [00:11:41]. This has led to discussions about building a much larger particle collider, provisionally named the [[Challenges and future of particle physics research | Future Circular Collider (FCC)]], which would cost approximately $17 billion and have a 100 km loop, compared to the LHC's 27 km [00:12:50]. Although there's no guarantee that a new collider would find dark matter, it might answer different questions or reveal completely unexpected phenomena [00:12:41].

Pure scientific research, such as that conducted at [[Large Hadron Collider LHC at CERN | CERN]], has historically led to numerous unforeseen benefits, including new cancer therapies, improved medical imaging, more efficient electric cars, advanced radiation detectors, and the World Wide Web [00:13:25]. Such fundamental research is considered essential for future applied research and technological advancements [00:14:42].

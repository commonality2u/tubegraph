Walt Disney Imagineering is the department where Disney's most ambitious ideas are brought to life, from stunt robots to realistic lightsabers and adorable droids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Unlike technology focused on convenience or extending life, Disney utilizes technology to improve lives by creating happiness and [[disneys_use_of_tech_for_storytelling_and_emotional_connection | making people happy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This pursuit pushes the boundaries of what technology can achieve in unexpected ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

The Imagineering department is where new projects are conceptualized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. When Walt Disney began building Disneyland, he sought individuals who could "think outside the box" to create rides, [[the_role_of_robotics_and_animatronics_in_disney_parks | robots]], and castles for this new type of park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. He named them "Imagineers" because their role was to imagine ways to bring Disney's magic to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Today, Imagineers have built legendary parks worldwide and continuously develop new concepts in their research and development (R&D) lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Cutting-Edge Technologies from Imagineering

Imagineering's R&D lab is a hub for [[technological_advancements_and_future_potential | cutting-edge technological advancements]].

### BDX Droids: Personality Through Engineering
The BDX units are some of the latest [[the_role_of_robotics_and_animatronics_in_disney_parks | droids]] developed by Imagineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. While other [[the_role_of_robotics_and_animatronics_in_disney_parks | robots]] can perform tasks like walking over uneven terrain or opening doors, what distinguishes these droids is their personality and cuteness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This is achieved through specific design and engineering decisions, from their walk to their "shimmy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

These droids are not autonomous; they are controlled by a person using a console <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. The controller dictates what the droid should do (e.g., "walk here," "throw a tantrum"), but the droid's actual response is determined by its training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Inspired by ducklings, Disney Imagineers create a series of animations for how the [[the_role_of_robotics_and_animatronics_in_disney_parks | robot]] should move, similar to a Disney movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. A digital version of the [[the_role_of_robotics_and_animatronics_in_disney_parks | robot]] is placed into a simulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

Instead of only being rewarded for meeting a goal (like walking from A to B), these droids are also rewarded for how closely they adhere to the predefined animations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This [[the_creative_potential_unlocked_by_ai_tools | reinforcement learning]] process allows for thousands of "reps" in a digital world without damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This training is then uploaded to the physical [[the_role_of_robotics_and_animatronics_in_disney_parks | robots]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

Imagineering focuses on how humans feel about [[the_role_of_robotics_and_animatronics_in_disney_parks | robots]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. The challenge is ensuring guests don't perceive the underlying technology, but rather fall in love with a character and feel emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. The droids' training has dual objectives: not only to perform a task without falling but also to be cute about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### The Realistic Extendable Lightsaber
Lanny Smoot, a renowned Imagineer with over 100 patents, invented the world's most [[the_creation_and_development_of_disneys_realistic_lightsaber | realistic expandable, extendable lightsaber]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. The challenge was creating a prop for performers that mimics the smooth extension seen in the Star Wars movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

*   **Mechanism:** The lightsaber blade unrolls from internal motors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Blade Construction:** It features a clear cap with two long, translucent tapes that unroll from inside the hilt, bending into a concave shape to form a rigid blade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Illumination:** A series of bright LEDs are embedded on these tapes, programmed to create a realistic glow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Realistic Effect:** The lightsaber's lights blink slightly based on its movement angle and strobe to give the illusion of flickering power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   **Usage:** This specific lightsaber is designed for extension and retraction, not for battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

### Holotile: The Omnidirectional Treadmill
Another invention by Lanny Smoot, the Holotile, is essentially a treadmill that allows movement in any direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

*   **Design:** The floor is composed of rotating circular tiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **Motion Control:** One gear on the bottom controls the overall spin, while another on top controls the angle of each tile's head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. This setup means a shoe always contacts the top of an angled disc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. The spin of the angled discs pushes the user in the opposite direction of their walk, maintaining their central position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Tracking:** Lidar cameras surround the surface, constantly scanning the user's feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. One camera identifies the foot's position on the tiles, while a second determines the foot's direction by tracking the shin bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. The demo featured six different lidar angles to ensure a clear view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   **Control:** The floor can also be controlled using a video game controller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   **[[the_future_applications_of_disneys_technological_innovations | Future Applications]]:** While its exact [[the_future_applications_of_disneys_technological_innovations | future use]] is still being explored, Imagineers are testing designs and playing games on it, suggesting potential use in parks or for filming in environments like "the Volume" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

### Stuntronics: Robot Stunt Doubles
[[the_role_of_robotics_and_animatronics_in_disney_parks | Stuntronics]] are [[the_role_of_robotics_and_animatronics_in_disney_parks | robot]] stunt doubles, notably used for Spider-Man launches over Disneyland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. These [[the_role_of_robotics_and_animatronics_in_disney_parks | robots]] perform flips that are too unsafe or impossible for human stunt performers, such as pulling 10 G's during a launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

The development involved flinging a metal stick with motors and actuators repeatedly, gradually refining it to become more human-like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. This process involves flinging a "Mini Man" robot hundreds of times, tracking results, and improving motion control through the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. Imagineers are open to their use in movies, though they haven't been requested yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

## The Purpose of Innovation: Storytelling and Emotion
For Disney, the primary purpose of its incredible [[technological_advancements_and_future_potential | technology]] is to [[disneys_use_of_tech_for_storytelling_and_emotional_connection | create a connection with guests]] and make them feel something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. According to Josh D'Amaro, who oversees Disney Parks, Cruises, and Products, the goal is to [[disneys_use_of_tech_for_storytelling_and_emotional_connection | tell a story]] and ensure guests feel something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

Kevin Feige, President of Marvel Studios, emphasizes that the [[technological_advancements_and_future_potential | technology]] serves to continue the [[disneys_use_of_tech_for_storytelling_and_emotional_connection | storytelling]] and [[advancements_in_immersive_experiences | immerse the audience]] and guests in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. When Disney acquired Marvel, the ability to collaborate with Imagineering to bring movie sets and stories to life in the parks became a key focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

The point of all the [[technological_advancements_and_future_potential | technology]] developed by Disney Imagineering is not mere utility or convenience, but to ensure that people get the chance to experience joy and be a kid again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. It's a unique approach to [[the_role_of_robotics_and_animatronics_in_disney_parks | robotics]] and [[technological_advancements_and_future_potential | technological innovation]], distinct from typical applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

Creating commercial [[nuclear_fusion_basics | nuclear fusion]] energy involves scaling up experimental devices to produce a net gain in electricity that can power homes and industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## The Core Challenge

While an individual [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion | fusion]] reaction releases [[energy_potential_of_fusion | tremendously more energy]] than it takes to initiate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, the primary [[challenges_of_nuclear_fusion | challenge]] for commercial viability lies in achieving a net energy output from the entire system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. It is possible to create [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion | fusion]] in a device like a particle accelerator, but the energy spent on the electronics and systems to make it happen currently exceeds the energy produced by the fusion itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. The goal is to obtain more total electricity *out* of the system than was put *in* to create the reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Small-Scale Fusors vs. Commercial Reactors

A Farnsworth fusor, a compact device used for demonstration purposes, is capable of performing a small amount of [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion | fusion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This type of device is significantly smaller and not designed for commercial electricity generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

In [[comparison_between_smallscale_fusors_and_commercial_fusion_reactors | contrast]], commercial electricity systems utilizing [[nuclear_fusion_basics | nuclear fusion]] will be much larger and more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. All [[fusion_reactors_and_techniques | fusion devices]] require a vacuum chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Different commercial approaches to [[fusion_reactors_and_techniques | fusion devices]] include:
*   **Stellarator-type** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>
*   **Helion's cylindrical devices** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>
*   **Tokamaks** with a D-shaped cross-section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>

## Path to Commercialization

Despite the [[challenges_of_nuclear_fusion | challenges]], the rate of technological progress in [[nuclear_fusion_basics | nuclear fusion]] is advancing rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. Both private companies and government projects are actively building systems designed to achieve commercial levels of [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion | fusion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. The focus is now on constructing these systems and integrating them into the electrical grid as quickly as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. There is a belief among researchers that [[fusion_as_a_solution_for_climate_change | electricity on the grid from fusion]] could become a reality within our lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

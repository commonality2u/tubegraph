Metformin is a widely used and affordable medication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> that has been effectively utilized by individuals with diabetes for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Its primary purpose is to help control blood sugar levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Mechanism of Action in Diabetes

When food and drink are consumed, blood transports sugars to cells for use as fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. In individuals with diabetes, blood sugar levels can become excessively high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Metformin works to help control these elevated blood sugar levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Extensive research on how metformin operates in people with diabetes dates back decades, even before the drug's initial approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Impact on Mortality in Diabetic Patients

A significant UK study, involving approximately 180,000 individuals, examined the mortality rates across different groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>:
*   People with diabetes taking metformin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   People with diabetes taking other non-metformin drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   People without diabetes who were not on any diabetes medication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

The study revealed that people with diabetes who were not taking metformin had double the mortality rate compared to those without diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

Remarkably, individuals with diabetes who were on metformin, despite being more obese and sicker to begin with, exhibited less mortality than people without diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Dr. Nir Barzilai highlighted this finding as "HUGE," noting that people with diabetes taking metformin died less than people *without* diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

However, it is crucial to note that this was a retrospective study, meaning it looked back at past events and could not definitively prove that metformin *caused* the reduced mortality, only that there was a correlation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Side Effects for Diabetic Patients

While the article primarily focuses on [[metformin_as_an_antiaging_drug | metformin as an anti-aging drug]], it also touches upon [[potential_side_effects_and_considerations_of_metformin_use | potential side effects and considerations of metformin use]] that would apply to diabetic patients as well. Common [[potential_side_effects_and_considerations_of_metformin_use | side effects]] during the first week of use can include feeling full quickly (early satiety), an upset stomach, and diarrhea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Metformin can also influence how the body responds to exercise, specifically affecting muscle growth; while exercise capacity will still increase, the muscle itself might not become as big <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

## Contrast with Anti-Aging Research

While Metformin is gaining popularity for its potential [[metformin_as_an_antiaging_drug | anti-aging benefits]], particularly among wealthy individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, it is important to distinguish this from its established use in diabetes. The research on [[metformin_as_an_antiaging_drug | metformin as an anti-aging drug]] is less understood in people without diabetes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, and requires further study, such as the upcoming TAME study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

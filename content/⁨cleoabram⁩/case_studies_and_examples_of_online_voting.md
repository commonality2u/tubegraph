While widespread [[online_voting_technologies_and_solutions | online voting]] for general elections remains a subject of debate due to various [[challenges_of_online_voting | challenges of online voting]] and [[cybersecurity_concerns_in_online_voting | cybersecurity concerns in online voting]], several specific cases and countries have implemented or experimented with digital ballot casting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Early Adopters: Astronauts in Space

One of the earliest and most surprising origins of [[online_voting_technologies_and_solutions | online voting]] can be traced to space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **First Instance**: In 1997, the US state of Texas introduced an [[online_voting_technologies_and_solutions | online voting]] option specifically for an astronaut aboard the Mir Space Station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The process involved filling out an application, receiving an encrypted ballot, sending it back, and having the vote recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Continuing Tradition**: This method of allowing astronauts to vote from space persists today, with American astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) planning to use this system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Online Voting for Special Circumstances

Beyond astronauts, [[online_voting_technologies_and_solutions | online voting]] has been adopted in more limited capacities for specific demographics.
*   **Military and Overseas Citizens**: Numerous US states currently offer [[online_voting_technologies_and_solutions | online voting]] options for military personnel and citizens residing overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. In 2020, approximately 300,000 Americans voted online through these provisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. However, current methods often involve emailing or faxing ballots, which [[cybersecurity_concerns_in_online_voting | cybersecurity experts]] deem insecure for broad national use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Global Adoption (Varying Degrees)**: A non-exhaustive map shows that many countries worldwide offer some degree of [[online_voting_technologies_and_solutions | online voting]] options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. However, these are predominantly available only to people with special circumstances, rather than the general population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The primary motivation for expanding [[online_voting_technologies_and_solutions | online voting]] is the hope that it could [[potential_impact_of_online_voting_on_voter_turnout | boost voter turnout]] and simplify participation in democratic processes, provided it can be done safely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Estonia: A National Online Voting System

Estonia stands out as a country with a more extensive [[online_voting_technologies_and_solutions | online voting]] system, integrated into its national digital infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **Electronic ID Cards**: Since the early 2000s, every Estonian citizen has received an electronic ID card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This card is used for various services, including healthcare, taxes, and [[online_voting_technologies_and_solutions | online voting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Voting Process**: When an Estonian citizen votes online, they use their ID card to validate their identity before casting their vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Addressing Coercion**: To mitigate the [[challenges_of_online_voting | challenge]] of coercion, Estonia allows voters to recast their vote multiple times online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Only the last recorded vote is counted, allowing individuals who might have been forced to vote a certain way to revote later in secret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. This contrasts with traditional online banking, which is not designed for secrecy in transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

Non-Fungible Tokens, or NFTs, are a form of digital art that have sold for significant sums, including $1.2 million, $29 million, and even $69.3 million US dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This phenomenon prompts the question of how digital art can achieve such high valuations, especially when it can be easily screenshotted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Blockchain as the Foundation

[[understanding_nfts_and_their_value | Explanations about the technology behind digital art]], also known as [[understanding_nfts_and_their_value | NFTs]], often mention that they "run on blockchain technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. A blockchain is described as a "chain of blocks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. While this explains the underlying mechanics, it doesn't immediately clarify why they are so expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## The Agreed-Upon Database

The reason [[understanding_nfts_and_their_value | NFTs]] gained traction, unlike digital images 10 years prior, is the existence of a database that a "critical mass of people agree to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This database happens to use blockchain technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. If enough people believe in this particular database, it becomes the definitive record of ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

When an NFT is transferred, such as when Alexis Ohanian gifted a "Serenapunk" NFT to his wife Serena Williams, he transferred the "credential" or the "entry into a database that says who owns it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. This concept clarifies that an NFT is essentially "a link to an image" where the value resides in this unique, agreed-upon record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

## Value in Certification

The underlying principle behind the value of [[understanding_nfts_and_their_value | NFTs]] can be compared to the value of traditional art. Just as a physical artwork's value can be tied to a "certificate" of authenticity, where "without the certificate, the artwork has no value," the blockchain serves a similar purpose for digital art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

For [[understanding_nfts_and_their_value | NFTs]], the significant difference is not *why* they have value, but *who* decides their value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Blockchain technology allows a new group of people to establish and agree upon the authenticity and ownership of digital assets, shifting the authority away from traditional art critics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

Ultimately, blockchain technology provides the agreed-upon framework that establishes scarcity and unique ownership for digital items, making them valuable in a way similar to how traditional art objects derive value from their provenance and certification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. [[comparison_of_traditional_art_and_nfts | NFTs]], facilitated by blockchain, represent a "new medium" and a "new canvas" for artists, taking the existing questions about art and value to an extreme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

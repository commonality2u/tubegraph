Humanity faces a global-scale disaster driven by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions, leading to a planet "on f-ing FIRE" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. In response, researchers are exploring innovative solutions, including the use of [[genetic_engineering_in_trees_to_capture_more_co2 | genetic engineering]] to combat climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This includes developing "supertrees" designed to capture more carbon from the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

While [[genetic_engineering_in_trees_to_capture_more_co2 | genetic engineering]] has been used for decades to manipulate crops, animals, and even humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, its application to trees for climate intervention represents a significant, ambitious project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The overarching idea is that humanity may soon need to take on the responsibility of deliberately and continuously regulating Earth's atmosphere for all living things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## How Genetically Engineered Trees Work

The company at the forefront of engineering these trees is led by CEO Maddie Hall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Their work involves [[potential_genetic_enhancements_and_their_implications | genetic engineering]] in a lab where new genes from other plants are incorporated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Plant cells with these new genes are grown on "selection media" to encourage their development into shoots and roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

The primary mechanism for carbon capture in trees is [[the_impact_of_photosynthesisenhanced_trees_on_carbon_cycles | photosynthesis]], where they take in carbon dioxide, sunlight, and water to produce oxygen and sugars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. To enhance carbon capture, engineers aim to make this process more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. A key enzyme in photosynthesis, "rubisco," sometimes picks up oxygen instead of CO2, leading to "photorespiration," which wastes energy and releases carbon dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

To counter this, the expression of genes controlling photorespiration can be altered using a "gene gun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This device coats gold particles with DNA fragments and shoots them into plant cells, incorporating the new genes into the plant's genome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This method is considered favorable from a regulatory perspective because it doesn't introduce non-plant pest genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Early results indicate that some seedlings show enhanced [[the_impact_of_photosynthesisenhanced_trees_on_carbon_cycles | photosynthesis]] and a higher rate of carbon assimilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Why Genetically Modify Trees Instead of Just Planting More?

A common question is why invest in [[genetic_engineering_in_trees_to_capture_more_co2 | genetically modified trees]] when more conventional tree planting could be an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Patrick, a co-founder, explains that simply planting more trees without enhancing their carbon capture ability would require planting a trillion trees to offset human carbon emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. If genetically enhanced trees could reduce that number to "a little bit above 500 billion," it would represent a massive reduction in the effort required to deal with existing carbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. A small change in an individual organism can magnify significantly when applied to a large number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

## Carbon Cycle Context

Trees play a role in the "fast" carbon cycle, absorbing CO2 during [[the_impact_of_photosynthesisenhanced_trees_on_carbon_cycles | photosynthesis]], but releasing much of it back into the atmosphere when their leaves fall or they decompose, often within a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. This contrasts with the "slow" carbon cycle, which involves carbon trapped deep underground in fossil fuels over centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. To truly combat climate change, efforts must go beyond just planting trees that participate only in the fast cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Genetically enhanced trees that can trap more carbon could be significantly helpful, especially if that carbon eventually gets trapped themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

## Addressing Concerns and Future Vision

The company acknowledges [[challenges_and_considerations_of_planting_genetically_altered_trees | concerns about genetically engineered plants]], particularly the potential for them to become invasive species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. They emphasize that their strategy is not to plant a single [[genetic_engineering_in_trees_to_capture_more_co2 | genetically modified species]] everywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Instead, they focus on enhancing native species, such as loblolly pine and longleaf in Southeastern Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Planting non-native trees can worsen the carbon problem by disrupting local ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Their goal is to be an example of how scientists can enhance [[the_impact_of_photosynthesisenhanced_trees_on_carbon_cycles | photosynthesis]] in plants native to their environments, inspiring local groups worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. They have publicly shared their research on photosynthetic efficiency to encourage other organizations to work on climate change and carbon removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

While genetically engineered seedlings appear larger than unaltered ones at the same age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, the company does not yet have evidence that these trees will reach a larger final adult size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. The enhancement means they accumulate biomass and reach their mature size more quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

The company is transitioning to a commercial tree-planting operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. By the end of 2023, they aimed to increase their planting capacity from 2.6 million to over 10 million trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. This represents the first commercial planting of a [[the_impact_of_photosynthesisenhanced_trees_on_carbon_cycles | photosynthesis-enhanced]] organism on a commercial scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. They emphasize this is just the beginning and will not solve climate change on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

The ultimate vision is profound: humans are not the first species to destabilize the atmosphere (e.g., algae producing oxygen caused a mass extinction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. However, humanity may be the first species that must intentionally regulate the atmosphere's composition for the entire biosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. This suggests a future where humanity takes on an unprecedented responsibility for planetary management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

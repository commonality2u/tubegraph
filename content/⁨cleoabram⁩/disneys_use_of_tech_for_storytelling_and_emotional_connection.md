[[disney_imagineering_and_its_role_in_innovative_technologies | Walt Disney Imagineering]] is the department where Disney brings its most imaginative ideas to life, from stunt robots to real-life versions of The Force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Walt Disney himself created the Imagineers to "imagine ways to bring the magic of Disney to life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Their core mission is to use technology to improve people's lives by making them happy and pushing the boundaries of what tech can achieve in unexpected ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Enhancing Interaction and Personality

### BDX Droids
The latest BDX units developed by [[disney_imagineering_and_its_role_in_innovative_technologies | Imagineering]] are notable for their personality and cuteness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. These droids are not autonomous but are directed by a person using a console <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. While the person tells the droid *what* to do (e.g., walk, throw a tantrum), the droid's specific responses come from its training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

Inspired by ducklings, [[disney_imagineering_and_its_role_in_innovative_technologies | Disney Imagineers]] created a series of animations for how the robot should move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. They then used reinforcement learning in simulations, where digital versions of the robots were rewarded not just for completing tasks but also for how closely they followed the pre-defined animations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This training allows for many more repetitions than in the physical world and prevents damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. The trained data is then uploaded to the physical robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

The design of these droids represents a cutting edge in [[the_role_of_robotics_and_animatronics_in_disney_parks | robotics]] focusing on how humans feel about interaction with robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. The goal is not for guests to see technology but to "fall in love with a character and feel things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## Immersive Storytelling through Props and Environments

### Realistic Lightsaber
Lanny Smoot, a renowned [[disney_imagineering_and_its_role_in_innovative_technologies | Imagineer]] with over 100 patents, invented the world's most realistic expandable lightsaber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Unlike movie props that rely on post-production visual effects, this lightsaber was designed for Disney Parks to appear real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

The lightsaber achieves its effect by unrolling two long translucent tapes from internal motors inside the hilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. These tapes bend into a concave shape to form a rigid blade, adorned with a series of bright LEDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The LEDs are programmed to create a realistic flicker and blink, mimicking the appearance of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. While impressive, this prop is not for battle and is intended for smooth extension and retraction rather than physical contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

### Holotile
Another invention by Lanny Smoot, the Holotile, is an omnidirectional treadmill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. The floor is composed of rotating circular tiles, each controlled by two gears: one for overall spin and another for the angle of the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. As a user walks in one direction, the spin of the angled discs pushes them back in the opposite direction, allowing for movement in any direction while remaining in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

The Holotile tracks a user's movement and direction using lidar cameras surrounding the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. One camera identifies foot position on the tiles, and a second camera determines foot direction by identifying the shin bone's location relative to the foot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. The system utilizes multiple lidar angles for comprehensive tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. The Holotile's primary purpose at present is for fun and experimentation, with potential [[the_future_applications_of_disneys_technological_innovations | future applications]] in parks or [[xr_stage_technology_in_film_production | film production]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

### Stuntronics
Stuntronics are robot stunt doubles designed to perform dangerous or impossible stunts for human performers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. For example, the Spider-Man stuntronic at Disneyland performs flips that would be unsafe or impossible for a human, enduring forces of up to 10 G's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. Their development involved repeatedly flinging a metal stick with motors and actuators, gradually making it more human-like through iterative learning and control refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. There is potential for these robots to be used in movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

## The Purpose of Technology: Emotional Connection

Josh D'Amaro, who oversees Disney Parks, Cruises, and Products, states that the ultimate purpose of all this technology is to "create a connection with our guests" and "make them feel something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

Kevin Feige, President of Marvel Studios, concurs, emphasizing that the mission is "continuing the storytelling" and "immersing the audience and the guests in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. He notes that [[disney_imagineering_and_its_role_in_innovative_technologies | Imagineering]] excels at this immersion, and there is a collaborative effort to bring stories from film sets to life in the parks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

The underlying philosophy is that Disney's technology is not primarily designed for utility or convenience but to tell a story and evoke emotion, allowing people to experience joy and "just be a kid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

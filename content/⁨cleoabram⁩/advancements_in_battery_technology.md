Historically, the idea of electric airplanes faced a significant challenge: the weight of batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Early electric airships, like one from 1883, used batteries weighing nearly a thousand pounds, made from zinc and chlorine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. As aviation progressed, it became clear that batteries were simply too large and heavy to effectively compete with burning liquid fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Modern Battery Composition and Energy Storage
Significant [[technological_advancements_and_future_potential | advancements]] in battery technology have transformed this landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Modern electric aircraft, like those built by Beta, utilize commercial off-the-shelf lithium-ion cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. These are the same lithium-ion cells found in a Tesla vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

A single battery pack in Beta's aircraft contains the same amount of energy as a standard Tesla car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. The basic building block of these battery packs consists of 18 lithium-ion cells arranged in parallel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Fourteen of these battery modules are then arranged in series to form one complete battery pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### Measuring Energy Storage
When designing an aircraft, two primary ways to measure the energy storage capacity of a battery are considered:
*   **Volumetric energy storage:** How much energy can be stored relative to its size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Gravimetric energy storage (Specific Energy):** How much energy can be stored relative to its weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

In 2010, a battery would have needed significant space and weighed 50 times more than the average aviation fuel to output the same amount of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Additionally, traditional fuel planes become lighter as fuel is burned, which is not the case for batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Recent Innovations and Impact
Over the last decade, batteries have become significantly smaller and, crucially for planes, lighter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. This progress has been observed in various consumer electronics, including laptops, phones, and electric cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This wave of innovation extends beyond just improving individual battery cells to also enhancing how densely they can be packed together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

While batteries are still not on par with traditional aviation fuel in terms of energy density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, their dramatically reduced cost has spurred a huge new wave of investment in [[future_potential_of_electric_planes | electric planes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This [[the_role_of_innovation_and_technology_in_clean_energy | innovation]] is allowing a complete redesign of what a plane looks and feels like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Although electric batteries are heavier than fuel, electric motors are lighter and smaller, offering more flexibility in their placement on the aircraft, which contributes to designs like vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

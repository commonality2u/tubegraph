Online voting, while offering the potential for increased voter turnout and convenience, presents a complex array of challenges that are both technical and political <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The stakes are incredibly high, involving the security of democratic processes in well-armed countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Cybersecurity experts, including Dr. Joe Kiniry and Dr. Josh Benaloh, highlight that many problems remain unsolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Current Landscape of Online Voting

While not widespread for general elections, online voting has limited applications:
*   **Astronauts**: Since 1997, US astronauts have been able to vote from space, a tradition that continues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Military and Overseas Citizens**: Approximately 300,000 Americans voted online in 2020 through options provided for military and overseas citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. These methods often involve emailing or faxing ballots, which cybersecurity experts deem unsuitable for a whole country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Global Perspectives**: Various countries allow online voting to different degrees, though it's mostly for people with special circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Core Challenges

Experts identify four primary challenges to widespread online voting:

### 1. Credentials
For online voting, secure digital credentials are required to verify a voter's identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Estonia's Model**: Estonia has addressed this by issuing electronic ID cards to all citizens, which are used for various services, including online voting since the early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **US Resistance**: In the United States, there is significant historical and [[political and technical barriers to online voting | political resistance]] to the rollout of a national ID system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. While Social Security numbers exist, their use as a foundational step towards a national ID is deemed a "no go" from a [[political and technical barriers to online voting | political standpoint]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

### 2. Coercion
Maintaining the secrecy of the ballot is crucial to prevent vote selling, buying, and manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Online voting makes this difficult:
*   **Lack of Polling Place Control**: Unlike a polling place where a voter casts their ballot in secret, an online voter using a phone with facial ID could easily hand the device to another person to cast their vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Receipts**: Online voting could allow for a "receipt" of how one voted, which could be used to prove to someone (e.g., an employer offering money) that they voted a certain way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Estonia's Solution**: Estonia combats coercion by allowing voters to recast their vote multiple times online, with only the last recorded vote being counted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. This contrasts with online banking, where transactions must be transparent and verifiable by both the user and the bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### 3. Client Malware
A major [[security concerns in online voting | security concern]] is the vulnerability of individual voter devices to malware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Expanded Attack Surface**: When voting online, every voter's device becomes part of the election's infrastructure, vastly increasing the "attack surface" for hackers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **Vote Flipping**: The primary concern is malware secretly flipping a vote (e.g., a vote for candidate A being recorded as a vote for candidate B) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   **Confirmation Difficulty**: Unlike online banking where transactions are confirmable, the secret ballot nature of voting makes confirming that a vote was properly cast very difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Benaloh Challenge**: Dr. Josh Benaloh invented a cryptographic method that allows voters to check if their encrypted vote was correctly generated without revealing how they voted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. If a small percentage of voters perform this check, it can statistically detect significant vote flipping across an election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **New Problem**: However, if discovering a problem on a voter's device could call an election into question, it creates an incentive for malicious actors to intentionally infect their phones with malware to disrupt elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

### 4. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks
Beyond vote flipping, a critical [[security concerns in online voting | cybersecurity risk]] is a denial of service attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   **Overloading Systems**: DoS attacks aim to overload a system with fake traffic, causing websites to crash, load improperly, or even creating internet outages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
*   **Impact on Turnout**: Even a slowdown for a few hours could be catastrophic, as factors like weather are known to influence voter turnout. A DoS attack could create "online weather" in specific areas to suppress votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
*   **Adversarial Capabilities**: Nations intent on influencing elections possess "unbounded amounts of hackers, computers, networks, and cash," posing a severe threat to the integrity and accessibility of an online voting system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. This is a problem of [[the role of cybersecurity in voting | cybersecurity]] at a national level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Broader Implications

The challenges extend beyond technology to encompass issues of public trust, which is not solely a technological problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. While progress is being made, many problems remain unsolved, and the path to a fully secure and trustworthy online voting system is arduous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

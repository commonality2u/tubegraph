The year 2024 is considered an "ultimate election year," with countries representing half the world's population holding votes for their leaders. This presents a significant test of democracy, requiring millions of polling places and billions of ballots [00:00:07]. However, voting is not always easy; people may need to travel long distances, wait in long lines, or take time off work [00:00:17]. This raises the question of why online voting isn't more widely adopted [00:00:31]. The answer is controversial, complicated, and involves high stakes [00:00:39].

## Current Landscape of Online Voting

While not widespread, online voting has surprising origins. In 1997, Texas implemented an online voting option for an astronaut to cast their ballot from the Mir Space Station [00:01:16]. This tradition continues, with American astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) planning to vote this way [00:01:31]. Currently, several U.S. states offer [[online_voting_technologies_and_solutions | online voting options]] for military and overseas citizens, with approximately 300,000 Americans voting online in 2020 [00:01:39]. Around the world, various countries have options for online voting to differing degrees, though it's mostly available for people with special circumstances, not the general public [00:01:49].

In most parts of the world, voting still involves traditional methods. In India, people go to polling stations and use electronic machines, with election officials marking fingers with ink to prevent fraud [00:01:57]. In Gambia, voters place marbles into colored drums [00:02:09]. In the United States, voters typically mark a paper ballot which is then counted by an optical scan ballot counter, similar to a Scantron test [00:02:18]. The physical paper ballot is retained as a backup for audits or recounts [00:02:29].

## The High Stakes of Online Voting

The biggest aspiration for online voting is to increase voter turnout and make participation in democracies easier [00:02:58]. However, the stakes are extremely high, as it involves critical national security. As one expert noted, "This is [[cybersecurity_concerns_in_online_voting | cybersecurity]] on a whole whole other level" [00:03:16]. Current methods used by select online voters in the U.S., such as emailing or faxing ballots, are explicitly not recommended for a whole country due to [[cybersecurity_concerns_in_online_voting | cybersecurity concerns]] [00:03:31].

## Key Challenges

[[cybersecurity_concerns_in_online_voting | Cybersecurity experts]] Dr. Joe Kiniry and Dr. Josh Benaloh identify four fundamental [[challenges_of_online_voting | challenges to online voting]] [00:04:05]:

### 1. Credentials
Online voting necessitates some form of digital credentials [00:04:13]. [[case_studies_and_examples_of_online_voting | Estonia]] serves as a model, where every citizen possesses an electronic ID card used for various services, including online voting since the early 2000s [00:04:25]. In Europe, national ID cards are common, but in the U.S., there has been strong political resistance to implementing a national ID system [00:04:35]. While Social Security numbers exist, their expansion into a national ID system is a "no go" from a political standpoint [00:04:49].

### 2. Coercion
A significant challenge is preventing coercion, where a voter could be forced or bribed to vote a certain way [00:05:13]. Unlike physical polling places, an online voter could hand their device to someone else after logging in, compromising the secret ballot [00:05:18]. This could lead to vote selling and manipulation [00:05:37]. [[case_studies_and_examples_of_online_voting | Estonia]] addresses this by allowing voters to recast their vote multiple times online, with only the last recorded vote being counted, thereby mitigating the risk of forced votes [00:05:42]. This differs from online banking, where transactions are part of a public ledger and are not secret [00:05:57].

### 3. Client Malware
When voting moves online, every voter's device becomes part of the election's infrastructure, vastly increasing the "attack surface" for hackers [00:07:26]. The primary concern here is "vote flipping," where malware on a voter's phone could change a vote without their knowledge [00:07:49]. Unlike online banking or encrypted messaging, the critical difference in voting is the ability to confirm that actions have been done properly, which is difficult due to the requirement of a secret ballot [00:08:16].

Dr. Josh Benaloh developed a method, the "Benaloh challenge," that allows voters to statistically verify the system's integrity [00:08:35]. Through a process of choosing to either submit an encrypted vote or check if it was correctly encrypted, voters can repeatedly test the system [00:08:52]. This process mathematically proves the system is working, and if even 1% of voters perform a check in a large election, statistical likelihood suggests that vote flipping would be caught [00:09:46]. However, if finding a problem on a voter's phone could overturn an election, it creates an incentive for malicious actors to intentionally infect their phones with malware to disrupt results [00:10:18].

### 4. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks
Beyond vote flipping, a major [[cybersecurity_concerns_in_online_voting | cybersecurity risk]] is a denial of service attack, which aims to overload a system with fake traffic, causing websites to crash or leading to internet outages [00:10:49]. Even a slowdown for a few hours could be catastrophic [00:11:00]. This is akin to creating "online weather" in specific areas to influence voter turnout, as physical weather is known to affect it [00:11:04]. Adversaries are "extremely talented" and possess "unbounded amounts of hackers, computers, networks and cash" [00:11:26], making such attacks a serious threat by nations seeking to influence elections [00:11:33].

## Public Trust and the Future

A significant non-technological challenge is maintaining public trust in voting processes [00:11:39]. While progress is being made in [[online_voting_technologies_and_solutions | online voting technologies and solutions]], many problems remain unsolved [00:12:00]. Despite the difficulties, the potential for online voting to work in the future is considered "huge if true" [00:12:13]. However, regardless of the technology, the importance of casting a human voice in democracy remains paramount [00:12:19].

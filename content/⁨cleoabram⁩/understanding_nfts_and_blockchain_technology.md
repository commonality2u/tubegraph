NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, are a form of digital art that has garnered significant attention due to their high sale prices, reaching millions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While the technology behind NFTs often involves "blockchain technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, understanding their exorbitant value requires a deeper look into the [[Value of art and its evolution | strange ways art is valued]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>

## The Question of Value

Many wonder how digital art can be so valuable, especially when it can seemingly be easily duplicated via a screenshot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. However, focusing solely on the underlying blockchain technology does not fully explain why these digital assets command such high prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The true explanation lies in the broader context of art valuation and its historical shifts.

## A Historical Parallel: The Scull Auction of 1973

The story of modern art valuation, and by extension NFTs, can be traced back to a specific event in 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. On October 18, 1973, Robert and Ethel Scull, early collectors of living artists like Warhol and Rauschenberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, hosted an auction at Sotheby's in New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This event was groundbreaking as it was the first time living artists' works sold for "many tens of millions of dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

This auction was met with strong disapproval, mirroring the sentiment many have towards NFTs today, as it was perceived as an unsettling "marriage between art and money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. A notable incident involved artist Robert Rauschenberg getting into a fistfight because he was dismayed by the price at which his work was trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Rauschenberg had originally sold his art for $900, only for it to be resold for $85,000, with him receiving none of the profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### The Rise of the Artist as Celebrity

This period marked a significant shift where living artists began to achieve celebrity status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Andy Warhol, for example, made celebrity his medium, eventually becoming as famous as the celebrities he depicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. When art's value became tied more to the artist's personal celebrity or the conceptual ideas behind the art, rather than the physical object itself, its value became "untethered from other benchmarks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The question shifted from "how much did it cost to make?" to "how much is that idea worth?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Since this moment, art prices have "entirely exploded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, and the definition of what constitutes art has also expanded to include abstract forms like text phrases, piles of candy, or even a banana taped to a wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## Originality, Authorship, and the Concept of Value

Artists like Sol LeWitt created art that could be instructions for others to make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Andy Warhol himself questioned originality, stating he wished more people took up silk screens so that "no one would know whether my picture was mine or someone else's" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. The appropriation artist Elaine Sturtevant even copied works by Warhol and Jasper Johns, with Warhol reportedly giving her his silkscreen to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. These examples highlight how the concept of originality and authorship became central to the understanding and appreciation of art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

When art functions as branding and concept, it also involves "hype and ego and speculation and [[How art functions as investment and speculation | investment]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. While concerns about money laundering and fraud exist in the art world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, the deeper reason for high valuations often stems from people genuinely valuing the concept behind the art and the act of its acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. For instance, the actual drawing on a wall by Sol LeWitt is not the artwork; the value resides in its accompanying certificate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. "Without the certificate, the artwork has no value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## NFTs: The Digital Certificate

The core difference between NFTs and previous forms of art is not *why* they have value, but *who* decides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. With NFTs, a new group of people is excited about a new kind of art, challenging the traditional arbiters of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of Reddit, describes his NFT collection, noting that some NFTs can also function as tickets to events, adding other forms of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. The reason NFTs have gained traction now, unlike digital images a decade ago, is the existence of a widely accepted database that tracks ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This database utilizes [[emerging_technologies_impacting_the_future | blockchain technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. As long as a critical mass of people agree on the legitimacy of this database, it becomes the definitive record of ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

This concept explains the frequently heard phrase that an NFT is merely "a link to an image" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. The value lies not in the image itself, but in the verified credential or entry in the blockchain database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>, much like how the certificate validates Sol LeWitt's wall drawing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### The MSCHF Experiment

To illustrate this flexible idea of value, consider the MSCHF art collective's experiment with an Andy Warhol drawing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. MSCHF bought a Warhol drawing for $20,000, made 999 exact copies, mixed the original with the copies, and sold each for $250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Most people would likely pay more if they could identify the original, especially if it came with a certificate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, indicating that perceived value is highly subjective and influenced by factors beyond the physical object.

## NFTs as a Reflection of Art's Evolution

Arguments like "I can just screenshot that" against NFTs are not new; they echo questions the art world has grappled with for decades: "What is value? Where does it come from? What is too much, for too little?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. NFTs push these questions to an extreme by involving even higher monetary values, no physical product, and democratized decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

While the prices for some digital images may seem astronomical, costing "so much more than the price of a house" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, NFTs are undeniably part of a larger context in the evolution of art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Experts predict a "new generation of artists who are creating exclusively with digital in mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, viewing this technology as a "new medium" or "new canvas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. NFTs, as a "shiny new thing," reflect our own understanding of value more clearly than ever before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>, embodying the essence of art itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

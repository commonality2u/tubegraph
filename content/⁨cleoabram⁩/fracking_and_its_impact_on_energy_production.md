Fracking, also known as hydraulic fracturing, is a process used by energy companies to extract oil and natural gas that is trapped within hard rock formations deep underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It involves drilling into rock and pumping in fluid at high pressure to crack it open, allowing the trapped oil and natural gas to escape into pipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## The Drive for Energy Independence

In the mid-2000s, American politicians were focused on ending dependence on foreign oil, as the US was producing significantly less oil than some other nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. While companies worldwide typically extracted fossil fuels from deposits about a mile underground, deeper reserves were found trapped in harder rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This deeper rock represented an opportunity for energy independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

The perfection of fracking technology led to a significant increase in the production of oil and natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. After its implementation, American dependence on foreign oil decreased annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, and the US became the top producer of crude oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## [[environmental_concerns_of_fracking | Environmental and Safety Concerns of Fracking]]

Despite its impact on energy production, fracking comes with significant costs, particularly concerning its [[environmental_concerns_of_fracking | environmental impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Climate Change

The increased burning of oil and natural gas made possible by fracking contributes to climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, leading to phenomena like fires, extreme weather, and drought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Water Pollution

Fracking has been linked to the pollution of groundwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The fluid used to crack rock contains chemicals that, while effective for extraction, are harmful to people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
A report on the topic indicates that:
*   Surface accidents, particularly with leftover fluids, can pollute drinking water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   Cracks in pipes going underground could cause problems, but typically not if systems are operating correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Induced Earthquakes

Fracking has also been linked to a rise in earthquakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. The primary concern is not the cracking of rock itself, but rather the disposal of the nasty leftover fluid by injecting it back into the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Most observed earthquakes in the US related to oil and gas operations have been linked to wastewater injection in basement rock, not hydraulic fracturing directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Injecting wastewater into the ground is considered the "best alternative" to keeping it on the surface, which would be more environmentally problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## The Hopeful Twist: Fracking Technology for Clean Energy

Despite its controversial past, the technology perfected for fracking fossil fuels might be the key to unlocking an even bigger source of clean energy: [[geothermal_energy_as_a_renewable_resource | geothermal energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

[[geothermal_energy_as_a_renewable_resource | Geothermal energy]] taps into the immense heat content of the Earth, which could supply humanity's total energy needs for millions of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Historically, extracting [[geothermal_energy_as_a_renewable_resource | geothermal energy]] at scale has meant finding natural reservoirs of hot water and steam, then channeling that steam to spin a turbine and generate electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### [[enhanced_geothermal_systems_with_fracking_technology | Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS)]]

A new approach, called [[enhanced_geothermal_systems_with_fracking_technology | enhanced geothermal systems]] (EGS), aims to overcome the limitation of needing natural reservoirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. In EGS, wells are drilled into hot rock, water is injected, and the hot rock is intentionally cracked to allow the water to pass through, heat up, and then be collected to spin a turbine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This process of cracking the rock with injected fluids is conceptually the same as fracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

Professor Mukul Sharma, known as the "Frack King" for his expertise in improving hydraulic fracturing processes for oil and gas companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, is now working on applying this technology to [[enhanced_geothermal_systems_with_fracking_technology | geothermal energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. He believes this technology could make [[geothermal_energy_as_a_renewable_resource | geothermal energy]] more commercially viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

### Addressing Concerns in Geothermal Fracking

The main objections to fracking for fossil fuels do not apply to [[enhanced_geothermal_systems_with_fracking_technology | geothermal applications]] because the injected fluids are environmentally benign, primarily water or close to water, rather than harmful chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

While the concern about induced earthquakes still exists, the risk is considered very tiny with current scientific understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Experts believe it can be done safely with careful management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

## [[future_of_energy_independence_and_renewable_resources | Future Energy Landscape]]

Although [[geothermal_energy_as_a_renewable_resource | geothermal energy]] currently generates little electricity globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, it could be a significant contributor to a [[future_of_energy_independence_and_renewable_resources | clean energy future]]. While wind and solar power are expected to increase as fossil fuel use declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, [[challenges_of_replacing_fossil_fuels_with_renewable_energy | reliable energy options]] are needed for periods when these intermittent sources are less productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. [[geothermal_energy_as_a_renewable_resource | Geothermal energy]] offers this reliability.

Other geothermal systems are in development that do not involve fracking, using closed-loop systems where no fluids leave the pipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. However, these systems currently limit the energy extraction rate compared to systems that create fractures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

The application of fracking technology to [[enhanced_geothermal_systems_with_fracking_technology | geothermal energy]] presents a potential "redemption story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. It suggests that a technology that contributed to climate change could be repurposed to help mitigate it, emphasizing that technology itself is neither inherently good nor bad, but defined by how it is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. This perspective highlights the need for diverse energy solutions in achieving a [[future_of_energy_independence_and_renewable_resources | sustainable energy future]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

The reign of dinosaurs on Earth, which lasted for 180 million years, came to an end approximately 66.04 million years ago due to a catastrophic event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

## The Cataclysmic Impact
On what would otherwise have been a normal day in the dinosaur kingdom 66.04 million years ago, a massive space rock, wider than Mount Everest is tall and traveling at an astonishing speed of 20 to 30 kilometers per second, struck the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. The impact was so powerful that it instantly vaporized the entire space rock and catapulted chunks of Earth beyond the atmosphere, potentially even reaching the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

### Immediate Aftermath
The impact created an apocalypse on the surface of the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. An immediate "thermal pulse," a wave of intense heat, swept across the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. Mega tsunamis rippled globally, making the immediate period after the impact horrific to experience for any living creature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

### Long-Term Consequences
For the dinosaurs that initially survived the direct impact, the worst was yet to come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. The ejecta from the impact blocked out the sun, plunging the entire planet into darkness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. With reduced sunlight, plants began to die, leading to a collapse of the food chain as animals that ate plants, and then the animals that ate those animals, perished in succession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

## Survivors of the Extinction
The creatures that managed to survive this global catastrophe were generally small, about the size of a German Shepherd or smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. Survival was also favored by those that had some form of "refugia," such as the ability to go into water or live underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

Despite the common [[misconceptions_about_dinosaurs | misconception that all dinosaurs went extinct]], dinosaurs are still alive today. Scientifically speaking, birds are considered dinosaurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. This means that birds are the direct descendants of the dinosaurs that survived the meteor impact, and therefore, dinosaurs are all around us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

The extinction event, though a "bad day" for dinosaurs, was a "really great day for mammals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. Humanity exists today because of this mass extinction, demonstrating how this "crazy history" shaped the world we inhabit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. The study of [[ongoing_research_and_future_of_paleontology | paleontology]] not only helps us understand how life got here but also provides insights into where it might be going in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

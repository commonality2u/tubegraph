Humans face extremely dangerous conditions when operating outside in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Spacesuits are critical as they function as human-shaped spacecraft, protecting astronauts from the vacuum and extremes of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

## Dangers of the Vacuum of Space

Instantaneous exposure to the vacuum of space presents multiple life-threatening dangers, with the order of fatality being a debated topic within the scientific community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>:

*   **Lack of Atmosphere and Pressure** The primary problem is the absence of atmosphere, leading to no oxygen and no external pressure to hold the body together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The pressure difference would immediately cause all air to rush out of the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Loss of Consciousness** Within about 15 seconds, the brain would cease to receive oxygen from the blood, causing blackout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Body Swelling** Reduced pressure would lower the boiling point of water in blood and tissues, turning it into vapor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. While the body would swell, human skin is resilient enough to prevent immediate explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Extreme Temperatures** Without an atmosphere, there is no ambient temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. In direct sunlight, one side of the body could heat up to 150°C, while the shaded side could slowly freeze down to -150°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Radiation** Exposure to radiation would likely cause poisoning and cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Micrometeoroids and Debris** Flying objects moving faster than bullets could shred the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

Survival is possible if rescued within approximately 90 seconds of exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

## Spacesuit Protection and Function

Spacesuits are essential for human survival in space, providing several critical functions:

*   **Atmosphere and Pressure** The primary function is to provide an atmosphere with breathable oxygen and sufficient pressure for the body to operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. This internal pressure is maintained by an inner bladder layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Spacesuits are pressurized to 4.3 PSI, which is comparable to the pressure felt at the bottom of a pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.
*   **Temperature Control** A liquid cooling garment is worn underneath the suit with water tubes to prevent overheating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. The outer insulation layer is white to reflect as much light as possible and keep the astronaut cool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
*   **Radiation and Physical Protection** The outer insulation layer also protects against dangerous radiation and against cuts and punctures from dust and debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.
*   **Mobility and Design** Beyond protection, suits must allow for movement. A restraint layer on top of the bladder stops the suit from inflating like a balloon and defines how the suit can move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. Astronauts must learn specific ways to move within the suit's constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

## Challenges of Lunar Exploration

Returning humans to the Moon for extended periods, especially near the lunar south pole, presents unique challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>:

*   **Extended Surface Operations** Astronauts need to stay outside on the lunar surface longer than ever before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Extreme Temperatures** Protection against extreme heat and cold is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. The lunar south pole includes permanently shaded regions that have never seen sunlight, resulting in extremely cold temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.
*   **Mobility and Range of Motion** Astronauts require more flexibility and range of motion to perform their jobs effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Suit Fit and Inclusivity** New suits must fit a wider range of body types to enable more people to go to space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

## Astronaut Life in a Spacesuit

Even with advanced [[design_and_features_of_next_generation_spacesuits | spacesuit design and features]], challenges persist for astronauts during spacewalks (EVAs):

*   **Long Duration** A real EVA can last approximately 13 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.
*   **Personal Needs** Astronauts use "Maximum Absorbency Garments" (MAGs) for waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Itching or a runny nose cannot be easily addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.
*   **Movement Limitations** While designed for mobility, suits still restrict movement, requiring astronauts to learn specific paths for actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Pressurization further stiffens the suit, making movement more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

These challenges highlight the rigorous [[development_and_testing_of_nasas_new_spacesuit | development and testing]] involved in preparing humans for extended missions in space, including the upcoming [[axiom_spaces_role_in_artemis_iii_mission | Artemis III mission]].

Psychedelics, a group of drugs capable of profoundly altering perception, have a complex history regarding their legal status and public perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

## Early Legality and Medical Interest

In 1955, psychedelics were legal in both the UK and the US, and were considered an exciting area of medical research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. One instance saw a British Member of Parliament taking a psychedelic on television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Historically, psilocybin mushrooms were used in religious rituals, and peyote (containing mescaline) was used in rituals by Maya and Aztec people, and continues to be part of some modern religious ceremonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

In the 1900s, psychedelics were legal and available in the United States, with companies making LSD even sending it directly to doctors for trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.

## The Shift: "War on Drugs"

By the 1980s, the legal and research landscape for psychedelics had drastically changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. The United States declared a "[[public_perception_and_the_War_on_Drugs | War on Drugs]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>, banning psychedelics and leading research to turn "much darker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. For the last 40 years, most psychedelics have remained illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

Dr. Matthew Johnson, a professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Johns Hopkins and a leading researcher in the field, noted that the conclusion these drugs were too dangerous for human research was not scientifically supported, but rather a "socio-political phenomenon" associating them with counter-culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.

### Misleading Research and Public Opinion

During this period, research that did occur often supported the government-backed narrative that psychedelics were extremely dangerous, solidifying [[public_perception_and_the_War_on_Drugs | public opinion]] in favor of the [[public_perception_and_the_War_on_Drugs | War on Drugs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. However, it is now known that not all of this research was accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

> [06:03:00] "In one really big study, researchers at Johns Hopkins spend 1.3 million dollars to investigate the effects of ecstasy on monkeys brains. When the results came out, the media publicized a shocking result: that just one night of using ecstasy could result in permanent brain damage."

This study, published in the prestigious *Science* journal in 2002, also claimed 20% of the tested animals died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>. A year later, the same researchers retracted their study after discovering they had accidentally injected the monkeys with methamphetamine instead of ecstasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. This incident significantly damaged the understanding of psychedelics for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.

## The Resurgence: Modern Research and Therapeutic Potential

Today, the tide is changing again, with a growing movement to make psychedelics legal once more in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. They are again an interesting area of study, with researchers suggesting major [[therapeutic_potential_and_research_on_psychedelics | health benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. The debate centers on whether these drugs, if proven to successfully treat disorders affecting millions, were misclassified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

In recent years, significant research has ramped up, leading to considerable hype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>. Studies show [[therapeutic_potential_and_research_on_psychedelics | psilocybin]] may relieve anxiety and depression in cancer patients, and MDMA may help two-thirds of patients with PTSD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. Dr. Matthew Johnson notes that the most confident findings are MDMA for PTSD, and psilocybin for alcoholism, smoking cessation, cancer-related distress, and major depressive disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>.

### Defining Psychedelics

Psychedelics are a broad category of drugs, often known by street names like ecstasy, acid, molly, and magic mushrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Scientifically, many of these are classified as "classic psychedelics" and act on the 2A serotonin receptor in the [[psychedelics_and_their_effects_on_the_brain | brain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. MDMA and ketamine are also generally classified under psychedelics but work differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

The word "psychedelic" comes from Greek words meaning "mind manifesting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. Users often experience vivid colors and shapes, intense emotions, and a profound change in their perception of the world and self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.

### How Psychedelics Affect the Brain

The reason psychedelics might help with various disorders is their ability to alter conversations between individual [[psychedelics_and_their_effects_on_the_brain | brain]] cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>. Researchers believe these drugs allow individual [[psychedelics_and_their_effects_on_the_brain | brain]] cells to form new connections, potentially rewiring how the [[psychedelics_and_their_effects_on_the_brain | brain]] processes emotions or desires, even after the drug's effects wear off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>. This could "blast people out of those ruts" characteristic of disorders with narrowed mental and behavioral repertoires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>.

However, research also indicates psychedelics are not for everyone; for instance, individuals with a family history of schizophrenia could experience manic or psychotic episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>.

## The Path to Legalization

The current promising research has put some psychedelics on the path to FDA approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>. MDMA might be approved for PTSD in the US within a year or two, with psilocybin approval possibly following a year or two later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>.

### Supervised Settings: The Current Model

The most likely vision for the [[future_of_psychedelic_legalization_and_regulation | legalization]] of psychedelics is not recreational use like cannabis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>. Instead, the debate focuses on supervised settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>.

If FDA-approved, doctors would prescribe the medication, and a licensed therapist would supervise the "trip" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>. This would involve going to a certified clinic, lying down, using an eye mask, listening to music (like Johns Hopkins' real playlist for trips), and having a supervised journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>. Research is still ongoing regarding the best type of therapy or stimulation during the trip, and how to ensure patient safety and comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>.

### State-Level Initiatives

Oregon and Colorado have legalized psilocybin for supervised use in "healing centers," where a facilitator, not a doctor, oversees the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>. However, none of these centers are open yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>. Whether FDA-approved or state-level, the current vision for taking psychedelics is exclusively in a supervised setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The story of psychedelics is a "classic tale of trying to control something that we don't fully understand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>. The initial fear and distrust stifled decades of innovation and progress that could have potentially helped millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>. Over the last decade, a more measured approach is emerging, hopefully independent of the fluctuating tides of [[public_perception_and_the_War_on_Drugs | public perception]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>. The focus remains on scientific research to understand if psychedelics can genuinely help the millions struggling with health conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>. The current research shows real promise and highlights how much more can be learned about the human [[psychedelics_and_their_effects_on_the_brain | brain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>.

[[Disney Imagineering and its role in innovative technologies | Walt Disney Imagineering]] is the department where Disney's most imaginative concepts are brought to life, including stunt robots, realistic lightsabers, and interactive droids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. While technology often aims to improve longevity or efficiency, Disney uses it to enhance lives by creating happiness and pushing the boundaries of what technology can achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## The Genesis of Imagineering
When Walt Disney began constructing Disneyland, he required individuals to help build every aspect of the new park, including rides, robots, and castles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. These individuals, known as "Imagineers," were tasked with thinking outside the box to bring Disney's magic to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Today, Imagineers continue to develop new ideas for Disney parks globally from their research and development lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Adorable Droids (BDX Units)
Disney's "BDX units" are examples of the latest advancements in robotics aimed at creating emotional connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Unlike robots designed for utility, these droids are notable for their personality and cuteness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Their design and engineering prioritize how they move, from walking to doing a "shimmy," to evoke an emotional response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

While not autonomous, these droids are precisely controlled by an operator using a console <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. The operator directs the droid's actions, such as walking or throwing a tantrum, but the droid's method of execution is determined by its training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Inspired by ducklings, [[Disney Imagineering and its role in innovative technologies | Imagineers]] created a series of animations for the robot's movements, similar to those used in a Disney movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

The droids are trained using [[The role of machine learning in robotics | reinforcement learning]] in a digital simulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Unlike typical robot training where rewards are based solely on task completion (e.g., walking from A to B), these droids are also rewarded for how closely they adhere to the predefined animations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This allows for thousands of "reps" in a virtual environment without damage, before the training is uploaded to physical robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This dual objective—performing a task while also performing it "cutely"—makes the development process more complex but crucial for human-robot interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

> "And that's what's really challenging about a lot of Imagineering projects is we don't want our guests to see technology. We want them to fall in love with a character and feel things." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>

## Stuntronics: Robot Stunt Doubles
[[Humanoid robots and their capabilities | Stuntronics]] are robot stunt doubles designed to perform feats that would be unsafe or impossible for human performers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. For example, the Spider-Man stuntronic launches over Disneyland, enduring forces of up to 10 G's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

The development of these robots began by repeatedly flinging a metal stick with motors and actuators, gradually refining its movements to be more human-like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. This iterative process, involving hundreds of launches and tracking results, allows for precise control of their motion through the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. While currently used in parks, there is a possibility that these stuntronics could be utilized in movies in the [[The future applications of Disneys technological innovations | future]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

## The Overarching Purpose of Disney's Robotics
Josh D'Amaro, who oversees Disney parks, cruises, and products, emphasizes that the ultimate goal of all this advanced technology is to create a connection with guests and evoke emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. Kevin Feige, President of Marvel Studios, concurs, stating that the mission is to continue storytelling and immerse the audience in the world, which [[Disney Imagineering and its role in innovative technologies | Imagineering]] excels at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

The collaboration between storytellers and Imagineers ensures that as new stories emerge, plans are simultaneously made to bring them to life in physical form within the parks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. This contrasts with traditional film production where sets are often dismantled after filming; Imagineering extends these worlds into permanent experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

Ultimately, the purpose of Disney's technological innovations in robotics and animatronics is not utility or convenience, but to facilitate [[Disneys use of tech for storytelling and emotional connection | storytelling]], create emotional experiences, and allow guests to feel joy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. This unique approach differentiates Disney's robotics from the general trends in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

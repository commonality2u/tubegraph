The Earth's magnetic field is crucial for life on the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Without it, cosmic radiation would eliminate all life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## Generation
The magnetic field is generated by the constant churning of a liquid soup of metals in the [[structure_and_composition_of_earths_inner_and_outer_core | Earth's outer core]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This churning creates enormous electric currents, which in turn produce the magnetic field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## Magnetic Reversals
The Earth's magnetic field sometimes reverses, meaning the North and South poles slowly swap places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This phenomenon is known from records on the ocean floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

### Evidence from the Ocean Floor
As basalt erupts along mid-ocean ridges, it records the magnetic field's orientation at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. As [[earths_crust_and_mantle | tectonic plates]] continue to be created and pulled apart, this record can be read like a barcode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Scientists have learned to read these "barcodes" of magnetic field reversals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

The last magnetic reversal occurred approximately 780,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. The timing of the next reversal is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

### Connection to the Inner Core
Precise [[seismic_waves_and_earths_core | seismic data]] and computer models indicate that the Earth's [[structure_and_composition_of_earths_inner_and_outer_core | inner core]] speeds up and slows down on a roughly 70-year cycle, separate from the surface's rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. While headlines might suggest the Earth's core is reversing, it's not a reversal of the magnetic field itself, but rather a relative change in rotational speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### Future Research
Scientists are developing experiments that mimic the inner Earth conditions to better understand the magnetic field and predict when it might next flip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. The cutting edge of research involves analyzing [[seismic_waves_and_earths_core | seismic waves]] with improved computational models and replicating deep Earth conditions on the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

Researchers are exploring the use of [[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | genetic engineering]] to create trees that can capture more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, aiming to help slow [[role_of_supertrees_in_climate_change_mitigation | climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This initiative seeks to strengthen one of humanity's key allies in combating global warming: trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## The Need for "Supertrees"

The planet is facing a significant man-made disaster driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. While simply planting more trees is a step in the right direction, its impact is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The concept of "supertrees" emerges as a way to enhance nature's own carbon capture mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### How Genetic Engineering Enhances Carbon Capture

Trees naturally take in carbon dioxide, sunlight, and water, releasing oxygen and sugars through photosynthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. One method to increase a tree's carbon capture is to make this photosynthetic process more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

A key enzyme in photosynthesis, "rubisco," sometimes picks up oxygen instead of carbon dioxide, leading to a process called "photorespiration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Photorespiration wastes energy and releases carbon dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Scientists can alter the expression of genes controlling this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

The modification is often achieved using a "gene gun," a device that coats gold particles with DNA fragments and then shoots them into plant cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This method allows the new genes to be incorporated into the plant cell's genome without using bacteria, which is often preferred from a regulatory perspective as it doesn't introduce non-plant pest genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

Early results indicate that some genetically engineered seedlings show enhanced photosynthesis and a higher rate of carbon assimilation, suggesting that it is possible to meaningfully increase the amount of carbon trees absorb from the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## Living Carbon and Their Vision

Maddie Hall, CEO of Living Carbon, leads a company engineering these trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Their work involves incorporating new genes from other plants into tree cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### Why Genetically Alter Trees?

A common question is why genetic modification is necessary when simply planting more trees is an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Patrick, a co-founder, explains that to account for human carbon emissions, an estimated trillion trees would need to be planted if their carbon-drawing ability isn't increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. By enhancing the trees' ability to capture carbon, the required number could be reduced to something like 500 billion, representing a significant reduction in the scale of planting needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. A small change in an individual organism can magnify significantly when spread over a larger number of organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

### [[challenges_and_controversies_of_largescale_tree_planting | Challenges and Controversies of Large-Scale Tree Planting]]

Even planting genetically unaltered trees has become controversial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. When trees perform photosynthesis, they reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide, but much of this carbon is released back into the atmosphere within a few years when leaves fall or the tree decomposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. This is known as the "fast" carbon cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. In contrast, burning fossil fuels releases CO2 from the "slow" carbon cycle, where biomass has been trapped underground for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Therefore, efforts are needed to ensure planted trees can contribute more significantly to long-term carbon sequestration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Trees engineered to trap more carbon could be helpful if they decay and get trapped themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

### Addressing Concerns About Invasive Species

When considering [[future_implications_and_challenges_of_genetic_modification | genetic engineering]] for plants intended for the wild, concerns about invasive species often arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Living Carbon's approach focuses on enhancing photosynthesis traits in species *native* to specific environments, such as loblolly pine in Southeastern Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Planting non-native trees, even fast-growing ones, can worsen carbon problems by disrupting the delicate balance of local ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

Living Carbon's goal is not to plant their specific genetically engineered trees everywhere but to demonstrate how photosynthesis can be enhanced in plants native to their environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. They have made their research on photosynthetic efficiency public to inspire other organizations to develop methods for improving tree growth and carbon capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### [[comparison_of_natural_and_genetically_modified_trees | Comparison of Natural and Genetically Modified Trees]]

While a genetically engineered seedling may appear larger than an unaltered one of the same age, indicating faster biomass accumulation, there is currently no evidence that the final adult size of the trees will be different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. The engineered trees simply reach their eventual size more quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

## Commercialization and The "Huge Vision"

Living Carbon is moving towards becoming a commercial tree-planting operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. By late 2023, they aimed to scale their operations to plant over 10 million trees, marking the first commercial planting of a photosynthesis-enhanced organism in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. This is seen as just the beginning of efforts to address [[role_of_supertrees_in_climate_change_mitigation | climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

The overarching vision is for humanity to take on an unprecedented responsibility: to deliberately and continuously regulate the atmosphere of the planet on behalf of all living things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Patrick notes that humans are not the first species to destabilize the atmosphere, citing the mass extinction caused by oxygen production when algae first evolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. The idea is that in the future, humans will need to become the species responsible for regulating the atmosphere's composition for the entire biosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This highlights the [[ethical_and_ecological_considerations_for_altering_species_to_regulate_the_atmosphere | ethical and ecological considerations for altering species to regulate the atmosphere]] and the profound [[future_implications_and_challenges_of_genetic_modification | future implications and challenges of genetic modification]] as humanity decides how much to change other species to achieve this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Formula 1 is described as the world's most popular car racing sport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Its cars are among the fastest and most expensive globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Rather than just cars, they are considered "epic group science projects" where ten teams compete to be first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Each team involves hundreds of people spending millions of dollars to push [[engineering_and_technology_in_formula_1|technology]] to its limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

The process of creating these vehicles involves both manufacturing in factories, such as the Red Bull Factory in England, and racing them at circuits, like in Bahrain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Design and Regulations

While a Formula 1 car might visually resemble other race cars like those in [[comparison_between_formula_1_and_american_motorsports|IndyCar]] with a single seat and open cockpit, a fundamental difference makes it special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. In [[comparison_between_formula_1_and_american_motorsports|IndyCar]], all cars share the same frame or chassis, making winning primarily dependent on how the car is raced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. However, in Formula 1, each team is required to design and manufacture its own cars, meaning success begins at the factory with the car's construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

The design process is governed by specific regulations provided by the FIA and F1, which stipulate the appearance and shapes of the cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This framework is what defines "the formula in Formula 1" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Teams intensely compete to discover the optimal design within these established rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Remarkably, despite each team designing and building a unique car, they typically arrive at the track with lap times within a second of each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. To gain an advantage when margins are so slim, teams must meticulously examine every potential area to extract performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

Teams are permitted to spend $135 million annually, excluding driver salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The level of [[engineering_and_design_of_formula_1_cars|engineering]] involved in building these cars is exceptionally advanced, utilizing many techniques and [[engineering_and_technology_in_formula_1|technologies]] also employed by organizations like NASA or SpaceX for designing rockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Car Performance Goals

A successful Formula 1 car must excel in two critical areas: executing extremely quick turns and achieving exceptionally high speeds in a straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The challenge lies in the fact that features optimizing one aspect often hinder the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. The team capable of designing a car that best balances both attributes secures the victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### Downforce and Grip

To make quick turns, a strong grip on the ground is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. This is achieved by generating "downforce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. More downforce translates to stronger grip and, consequently, quicker turns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

*   A Formula 1 car can be conceptualized as an upside-down airplane; just as air across a plane's wings creates lift, air across an F1 car forces it downwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   To achieve this "sucking" effect, higher air pressure is needed above the car and lower pressure below it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   Lower pressure air is created by making it move very fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. The goal is to accelerate air as much as possible under the floor and decelerate it on top of the floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   A particularly effective method for generating fast, low-pressure air beneath the car is by creating tiny tornadoes, or "vortexes," which generate significant low pressure due to their rotational structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. These structures extend along the floor, maintaining a long region of low pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

At top speed, a Formula 1 car can generate downforce three to four times its own weight, theoretically allowing it to drive on a ceiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

### Drag and Speed

While downforce aids turning, it comes at the cost of increased drag, which impedes the car's movement through the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. For instance, the back wing, crucial for downforce in turns, acts like a parachute slowing the car on straightaways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. To counteract this, Formula 1 teams are permitted to incorporate a control that allows the driver to flip part of the wing down, enabling the car to accelerate faster on straights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This system is known as the Drag Reduction System (DRS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Designing a winning Formula 1 car necessitates a careful balance of these effects, pushing the boundaries of regulations and physics to achieve marginal gains in grip and speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## Driver Experience

Sitting in a Formula 1 car, the driver's legs are positioned above their butt, and their back is reclined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This creates a feeling of vulnerability and can be claustrophobic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. The experience of driving at 200 mph in such a position is described as terrifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The seat, crafted from carbon, is highly customized to the driver's body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

Driving a Formula 1 car is likened to a roller coaster that shoots off, but "5 to 10 times worse," all while operating a steering wheel equipped with numerous buttons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. Even experienced drivers, like Max Verstappen, still feel a "whoa" sensation when the car accelerates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. Since no two drivers are identical, no two Formula 1 cars are exactly alike, even within the same team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. Teams maintain extensive records of each driver's measurements, including seat and pedal positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

The steering wheel, unique to each team, features dozens of buttons, knobs, and switches designed to optimize the engine, tires, brakes, and other systems in various scenarios while the driver is racing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. Drivers memorize all button functions to operate them without looking at the wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

## Materials and Manufacturing

Formula 1 cars are exceptionally light, fast, and strong due to their construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Nearly every visible part of the car is made from carbon fiber, a material ten times stronger than steel but half its weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Carbon fiber's excellent strength-to-weight ratio allows for extremely light yet highly structured and strong components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. It possesses a fabric-like quality, allowing light to pass through its woven structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

To create carbon fiber parts, teams first manufacture patterns in the desired shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Carbon fiber cloth is then laid down, sometimes in as many as 100 layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Air is extracted from these layers, which are then placed into a pressure cooker to compress them with resin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. The resulting carbon fiber pieces, along with other metal parts, are cut and measured using large programmable machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

For metal components, the specific type of metal used depends on its required function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Aluminum is a common material throughout the car's construction for parts and components due to its lightness and strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Teams also use dense alloys like densimet to add weight to the car when needed, for example, to meet minimum weight requirements if a driver is underweight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. These alloys are used in tiny strips throughout the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. A Formula 1 car comprises thousands of individual pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

### Paint and Aesthetics

The paint job on a Formula 1 car is highly significant to fans, especially during its initial release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Teams dedicate substantial effort to designing aesthetically pleasing liveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Beyond appearance, the paint must contribute to speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. For instance, many sponsor logos are painted directly onto the car rather than applied as stickers, as even a tiny edge from a sticker could create unwanted drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. The meticulous detail, design, and effort invested in the finished car are astonishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

## Engine Technology

A Formula 1 engine is considered one of the world's most advanced engine development facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. Red Bull, for example, is transitioning from purchasing engines (previously from Honda) to designing and manufacturing their own custom engines for 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. The primary reason for building an in-house engine is to gain greater control and achieve a paramount tie-in between the chassis and the engine, allowing for better synergy with aerodynamics and overall car performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This significant investment aims to extract more speed and control, ultimately leading to more race victories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

The fundamental operation of a Formula 1 engine is similar to a standard car engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Both typically use a four-stroke internal combustion engine, where a piston moves down and up within a cylinder in four strokes:
1.  Air and fuel enter the chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.
2.  The mixture is compressed and heated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.
3.  A spark ignites the mixture, causing an explosion that drives the piston down, generating mechanical movement to turn the wheels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
4.  The piston lifts to push out the remaining gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.

This entire process occurs within each cylinder. Formula 1 cars use V6 engines, meaning they have six cylinders arranged in a V-shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

A major distinction between a road car and a Formula 1 car engine is the maximum number of cycles (down-up strokes) per minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. A typical road car achieves around 6,000 cycles per minute, whereas a Formula 1 car can exceed 15,000, contributing significantly to greater power and speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. F1 cars also incorporate other [[engineering_and_technology_in_formula_1|technologies]] to boost performance, such as a turbocharger, which compresses air before it enters the cylinder, resulting in a more potent combustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

The [[future_developments_in_formula_1_engines|engines being developed for 2026]] will use less fuel and more electricity, leading to a slightly different sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. Teams test these engines at different speeds, running power curves to measure performance with the throttle wide open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

### Impact on Car Innovation
Formula 1 cars demonstrate why they are relevant to everyday consumers: although the [[engineering_and_technology_in_formula_1|technology]] may not be entirely new, it is combined, tweaked, and perfected by hundreds of experts with millions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. These advancements inspire improvements in car [[formula_1s_impact_on_car_innovation_and_future_trends|technology]] for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

## Race Day Operations

### Pit Stops
During a race, every car must exit the track at least once to enter its pit box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. There, approximately 22 members of the pit crew rapidly change tires and other parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. An efficient pit stop takes less than two seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>, with a trophy awarded for the fastest pit stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

All teams have access to the same tire options for each race: hard, medium, and soft compounds, or two types of wet tires if it's raining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. Soft tires offer the most grip but wear out quickest, while hard tires are the opposite, and medium tires fall in between <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. Drivers can feel when their tires are losing grip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. Selecting the correct tires at the opportune moment is a crucial element of a team's race strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.

### Strategy and Collaboration
During a race, drivers communicate exclusively with their race engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. However, this engineer is also in constant communication with a large team of strategists, all working to determine the best approach to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. Most of these strategists are located back at the factory in a large room resembling a NASA control center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.

These strategists don't just devise plans; they utilize supercomputers to run millions of real-time simulations throughout a race, accounting for factors like weather, brake temperature, tire performance, and competitors' actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. The aim is to optimize their own strategy while anticipating and reacting to competitors' moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. Race engineers often wear dual headphones to monitor conversations from both cars simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.

Ultimately, despite all the [[engineering_and_technology_in_formula_1|technology]], strategists, supercomputers, and simulations, success in Formula 1 still hinges on human skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. Drivers must maintain focus amidst constant communication and pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.

A Formula 1 car is never truly finished; teams are continuously learning, modifying, and rebuilding between each race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. The success of a Formula 1 car is a testament to human ingenuity and, increasingly, human collaboration, with engineers, designers, strategists, and athletes working together to continually improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.

The behavior of [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes|black holes]], particularly regarding what happens to matter and information that falls into them, presents one of the most profound mysteries in physics: the [[hawking_radiation_and_information_paradox|black hole information paradox]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

## The Classical View: Information Lost
According to [[einsteins_theory_of_relativity_and_black_holes|Einstein's theory of relativity]], if something falls into a [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes|black hole]], it crosses the event horizon and is irrevocably pulled towards the [[the_mystery_of_singularities_and_the_beginning_of_the_universe|singularity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. From this classical perspective, anything that goes into a [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes|black hole]] is ripped apart and effectively ceases to exist, going to an "infinitely distorted space and time," with "no" way back out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

## Hawking Radiation and the Paradox
[[recent_discoveries_and_theories_in_black_hole_physics|Stephen Hawking]] challenged this view, discovering that "[[hawking_radiation_and_information_paradox|black holes ain't so black]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. His work showed that [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes|black holes]] emit what is called [[hawking_radiation_and_information_paradox|Hawking radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. This radiation is a form of heat, meaning the [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes|black hole]] is losing energy and, over vast eons, will eventually evaporate completely, leaving nothing but the emitted [[hawking_radiation_and_information_paradox|Hawking radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

The paradox arises because a fundamental law of the universe dictates that information is conserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. Information can be scrambled but not destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. However, [[hawking_radiation_and_information_paradox|Stephen Hawking]]'s initial calculations suggested that the [[hawking_radiation_and_information_paradox|Hawking radiation]] was "information free" or "purely thermal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. This would imply that any information about what fell into the [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes|black hole]] would be erased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>, directly contradicting the principle of information conservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. This discrepancy bothered many physicists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

## Proposed Solutions and Ongoing Research
The [[hawking_radiation_and_information_paradox|black hole information paradox]] is at the forefront of [[recent_discoveries_and_theories_in_black_hole_physics|cutting-edge research]] into [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes|black holes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

### Information Imprinted on Radiation
In 2019, a series of papers suggested that [[hawking_radiation_and_information_paradox|Stephen Hawking]] might have missed a subtle detail in his calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. These papers propose that the [[hawking_radiation_and_information_paradox|Hawking radiation]] is, in fact, *not* information-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. Instead, all the information about what fell into the [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes|black hole]] is imprinted in the radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. This resolution aligns with the law of information conservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

### Explaining Information Release
The challenging question then becomes: how does information, which was thought to have gone to the [[the_mystery_of_singularities_and_the_beginning_of_the_universe|singularity]] at the end of time, get outside again as radiation, given that nothing is supposed to escape a [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes|black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>? There is currently no universally agreed-upon picture for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

One theoretical description suggests that the interior of the [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes|black hole]] is, in some sense, the same place as the exterior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. This could involve wormholes opening up from the interior to the exterior, allowing bits of information to pass through and emerge in the [[hawking_radiation_and_information_paradox|Hawking radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

### Alternative Views
Other theories, still being actively researched, propose even more radical ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>:
*   Perhaps an object never truly "goes in" to a [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes|black hole]], meaning there is no "inside" in the way we typically conceive it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
*   Another perspective relates to [[the_holographic_principle_and_its_implications|the holographic principle]], suggesting that everything is just information without a definitive physical location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. This aligns with the idea of the universe functioning like a "giant quantum computer" or a "network of entangled qubits," where reality can be described as a network of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

The resolution of the [[hawking_radiation_and_information_paradox|black hole information paradox]] is seen as fundamental, likely tied to the very nature of spacetime itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes|Black holes]] serve as extreme laboratories that push the boundaries of our understanding, revealing the hidden structure of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

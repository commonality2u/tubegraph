The development of electric aircraft aims to address the significant environmental impact of air travel, which has steadily increased its carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere over recent generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This pursuit represents an opportunity to [[innovations_in_aircraft_design | rethink planes themselves]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

## Historical Context of Electric Aviation

The concept of electric aviation is not new, predating modern airplanes with early electric airships, such as one from 1883 that utilized a nearly thousand-pound battery made from zinc and chlorine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. However, it quickly became apparent that batteries were too large and heavy to compete with the energy density of burning liquid fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.

## The Weight and Energy Density Challenge

A primary [[challenges_faced_by_supersonic_planes | challenge in developing electric aircraft]] historically has been the weight and energy storage capacity of batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. When building an airplane, two key metrics for battery energy storage are:
*   **Volumetric energy density:** How much energy can be stored relative to its size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Gravimetric energy density (specific energy):** How much energy can be stored relative to its weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

In 2010, a battery system equivalent in energy to average aviation fuel would have required the same amount of space but weighed 50 times more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Furthermore, fuel planes become lighter as they burn fuel during flight, whereas batteries do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Despite significant progress, batteries are still "far from fuel" in terms of overall energy density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## [[advancements_in_battery_technology_for_aviation | Advancements in Battery Technology]]

Over the last decade, [[advancements in battery technology for aviation | batteries have become]] significantly smaller, lighter, and crucially, much cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. These [[advancements in battery technology for aviation | innovations]] are being applied to electric planes, encompassing not only improvements in individual batteries but also in how densely they can be packed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Companies like Beta are utilizing commercial off-the-shelf lithium-ion cells, which are the same type used in Tesla cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. One battery pack in their aircraft holds the same amount of energy as a standard Tesla car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges Through Design and Strategic Focus

The challenges of battery weight are partially offset by the lighter and smaller nature of electric motors, which offers greater flexibility in their placement on the aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. This has enabled the development of [[innovations in aircraft design | new aircraft designs]], such as vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. VTOL capability allows aviation to access locations without conventional airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

Electric planes are not expected to replace large, long-haul passenger planes soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. However, they don't need to completely replace them to make a significant impact on emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Short-haul flights:** Approximately one-third of passenger aviation emissions come from short-haul flights (less than 1500 kilometers or 932 miles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Electrifying these flights can make a substantial reduction in emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Freight and delivery:** Electric planes, particularly VTOL models, are focusing on freight transport. This offers the potential to reduce carbon emissions not just from aviation but also from ground-based delivery methods like trucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. UPS has partnered with Beta, considering how delivery models might change without reliance on roads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. This strategic focus on [[future_of_freight_and_delivery_with_electric_planes | future of freight and delivery with electric planes]] makes electric aviation viable with current technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

Despite the ongoing [[challenges faced by supersonic planes | challenges]], the rapid pace of aeronautical innovation over the past century suggests that solutions to current hurdles in electric aviation are within reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

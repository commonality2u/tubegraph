Government regulations worldwide, particularly those promoting [[electric_vehicles_in_racing | electric vehicles]], are significantly impacting the future of car racing, creating an "existential moment" for established sports like Formula 1 (F1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The core issue for F1 is that the cars currently used are not fully electric, while more and more vehicles driven by the public are transitioning to electric power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## The Push Towards Electrification

Big companies invest in and advertise their cutting-edge car technology in F1, using it as a platform to showcase their ability to build excellent cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. However, if the technology showcased (gasoline cars) becomes outdated, the sport risks losing its purpose and investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

A tipping point has been reached with governments worldwide discussing and implementing bans on new gas car sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. For instance:
*   California has banned new gas car sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   The entire European Union plans to ban new gas car sales by 2035 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   By 2040, owning a car with a tailpipe might be comparable to owning one with a car phone, indicating a major technological shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

This regulatory drive towards electrification means that race series are expected to advertise the future of cars for the general public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## The Inception of Formula E

The creation of [[Formula 1 vs Formula E | Formula E]], the fully electric car racing series, was a direct response to these impending regulatory changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The idea for [[Formula 1 vs Formula E | Formula E]] originated 11 years prior at a dinner in Paris, attended by key figures including:
*   **Alejandro Agag:** Spanish businessman and former member of the European Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Antonio Tajani:** Former European Commissioner for Transport, responsible for transportation regulation across the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Jean Todt:** President of the FIA, the governing body of Formula 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

During this dinner, Antonio Tajani emphasized that the European Commission would "really going to push electrification" as the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Formula 1's Dilemma

Despite the clear shift towards electrification, F1 faced an "innovator's dilemma" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Technological Limitations:** 11 years ago, electric car batteries could not support F1's race requirements of covering at least 305 kilometers (190 miles) in under two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Industry Reluctance:** In 2011, most of F1's marquee car companies did not produce [[electric_vehicles_in_racing | electric cars]] and therefore did not want the sport to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

### Exclusive Licensing and Future Conflict

To address this, the FIA decided to create a brand new, separate electric championship: Formula E <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. A key agreement was an exclusive 25-year license granted to [[Formula 1 vs Formula E | Formula E]] for fully electric racing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This license began in 2014 and expires in 2039 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This timeline is significant because the license expires four years after the EU and California's new gas car sales bans take effect in 2035 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

Although Formula 1 has transitioned to hybrid powertrains with electric motors, its license prevents it from becoming purely electric, creating a potential conflict with [[Formula 1 vs Formula E | Formula E]]'s exclusive license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

## The Imperative for Change

Motorsports must evolve to align with the technology being sold to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. If a championship does not race the technology that is now being mass-marketed, it creates a "great distance" between the sport and the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. The argument is that unlike horse racing, where horses are not illegal, combustion cars are projected to become illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. This emphasizes the urgent need for racing to embrace the [[future_of_car_racing | future of cars]], driven by government regulations.

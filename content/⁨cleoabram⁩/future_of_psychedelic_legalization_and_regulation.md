The [[history_and_legal_status_of_psychedelics | legal status of psychedelics]] has undergone significant changes over time, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom.

## Historical Context

In 1955, psychedelics were legal in both the UK and the US, considered an exciting area of medical research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Early 20th century saw psychedelics like LSD legally available in the United States, with companies distributing them to doctors for experimental use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

However, by the 1980s, the situation had drastically changed with the declaration of a "[[public_perception_and_the_war_on_drugs | War on Drugs]]" in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Psychedelics were banned, and research turned "much darker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This shift was largely a socio-political phenomenon, as these drugs became associated with counter-culture movements, making them forbidden even for researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

During this period, some research supported the government's narrative that psychedelics were extremely dangerous, cementing public opinion in favor of the [[public_perception_and_the_war_on_drugs | War on Drugs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Notably, a 2002 study published in *Science* claimed ecstasy caused permanent brain damage in monkeys and resulted in 20% animal deaths, a finding later retracted in 2003 because researchers accidentally injected meth instead of ecstasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This misleading information significantly damaged public understanding of psychedelics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

## A Changing Tide and Renewed Research

Now, the tide has begun to change again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. There is a new and growing movement to make psychedelics legal again in the US, with a renewed interest in them as an area of study due to potential [[therapeutic_potential_and_research_on_psychedelics | major health benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This recent surge in interest and research, particularly over the last decade, has generated considerable optimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

Leading researchers in this field include Dr. Matthew Johnson, a Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Johns Hopkins, who has been studying psychedelics since 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

Promising research findings include:
*   A single high dose of psilocybin has been shown to relieve anxiety and depression in cancer patients for six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   Two-thirds of patients treated with MDMA no longer experienced PTSD in a study published in *Nature* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   Other areas of confidence include MDMA for PTSD, and psilocybin for alcoholism, smoking cessation, cancer-related distress, and major depressive disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

The ability of psychedelics to help with a wide range of disorders is attributed to their capacity to [[psychedelics_and_their_effects_on_the_brain | alter conversations between individual brain cells]], essentially "rewiring" how the brain processes emotions or desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. They appear to help "blast people out of those ruts" characteristic of disorders with narrowed mental and behavioral repertoires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

However, it is crucial to note that psychedelics are not for everyone. For individuals with a family history of schizophrenia, research indicates that psychedelics could trigger manic or psychotic episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

## Future of Legalization and Regulation Models

The current research is promising enough that some psychedelic drugs are on the path to FDA approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. MDMA is anticipated to be approved by the FDA for PTSD in about a year or two, with psilocybin likely following a year or two after that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

The future of psychedelic legalization is unlikely to resemble recreational cannabis access, where individuals can purchase and use it at their leisure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. The primary focus of current debates and proposed models is on **supervised settings** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

### Model 1: FDA Approved & Prescribed

This model involves doctor-prescribed medication with supervision by a licensed therapist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. In this future, patients would attend certified clinics where they would take the medication in a controlled, comfortable environment, potentially with an eye mask and specific music, all under professional supervision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. Research is still ongoing to determine the most effective types of therapy and stimulation during the psychedelic experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

### Model 2: State-Level Legalization (e.g., Oregon, Colorado)

States like Oregon and Colorado have legalized psilocybin, allowing individuals to take it in supervised "healing centers" with a facilitator, though not necessarily a doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. As of now, none of these centers are open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

The conversation about psychedelics is rapidly evolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. However, current scientific and governmental focus remains squarely on supervised therapeutic use, rather than recreational access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. The ultimate goal is to base regulation on robust scientific evidence, free from unwarranted fear or hype, to potentially help millions struggling with mental health conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

One of the most significant concerns and applications of [[introduction_to_quantum_computers | quantum computing]] involves its potential impact on existing encryption methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. A fully functional [[introduction_to_quantum_computers | quantum computer]] could develop code-breaking capabilities that might render all forms of online encryption unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

## Shor's Algorithm and RSA Encryption

The first major algorithm developed for [[introduction_to_quantum_computers | quantum computers]] is Shor's Algorithm, named after Peter Shore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. This algorithm can find prime factors for very large numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. This capability is critical because it forms the basis for "RSA encryption," which is used for conducting virtually all transactions on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

Current encryption schemes rely on the fact that it is computationally impossible to crack RSA encryption using a brute-force [[difference_between_classical_and_quantum_computers | classical algorithm]]; it would take billions of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. However, a [[introduction_to_quantum_computers | quantum computer]] could perform this task far more efficiently, potentially in mere hours to days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

## The Global Race for Quantum Supremacy

This potential capability explains the global race to develop [[introduction_to_quantum_computers | quantum computers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. Whichever nation first develops a practical [[introduction_to_quantum_computers | quantum computer]] with code-breaking abilities would gain a tremendous advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Current Status and Future Outlook

Despite concerns, [[introduction_to_quantum_computers | quantum computers]] are not currently used to break internet security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Breaking current encryption, specifically RSA, would require a [[introduction_to_quantum_computers | quantum computer]] with approximately a million qubits or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

As of the video's recording, IBM held the record with a 433-qubit [[introduction_to_quantum_computers | quantum computer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. While there is a significant difference between 433 and a million qubits, experts are confident that this threshold will be reached sooner than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

In the next five years or even less, a transition to "quantum-safe algorithms" is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. RSA encryption will likely be phased out gradually and replaced by quantum-safe encryption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. The field is progressing at an incredibly fast rate, solving problems that were previously considered uncrackable just two years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. As long as the physics allows it, engineers are expected to find a way to achieve these advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

Journalist Johnny Harris has launched a new show, "Let Me Explain," focused on exploring potential future solutions to global challenges with a distinctly optimistic perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The show aims to provide journalistically rigorous, yet genuinely optimistic, explanations about [[emerging_technologies_impacting_the_future | technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. It seeks to counteract prevalent pessimistic narratives by imagining scenarios where new ideas successfully improve lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## A New Approach to Journalism

Harris, previously known for his work with Vox, including "Explained" on Netflix and Vox's YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, recognized a common pattern in how new ideas are reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. He highlights a historical tendency for media to dismiss groundbreaking concepts as implausible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### The Cycle of Skepticism

Harris observes a predictable progression in the public and media's reaction to novel ideas:
1.  "It's not possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>
2.  "It's too expensive, they can't get the cost down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>
3.  "Do people really need that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>
4.  "Oh, it's just a fad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>
5.  Followed by: "Oh my god, it changed the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>

This pattern is exemplified by an October 1903 newspaper article titled "Flying Machines Which Do Not Fly," which posited that sustained efforts for "one million to ten million years" would be needed for a flying machine to truly fly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Just two months later, the Wright brothers achieved their famous assisted flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Harris notes that negative or skeptical stories are often easier to tell and popular to consume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Countering Pessimism with [[importance_of_optimistic_visions_for_future_innovation | Optimism]]

The new show is motivated by a desire to combat widespread pessimism, particularly among younger generations who often express feelings that the world is deteriorating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Harris believes that while journalists have a responsibility to be skeptical and highlight challenges, they also have a duty to help people imagine "what could go right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

> "People feel this way because we have real problems and there’s more that we could do to fix them. And because there’s a lot of very lucrative fear mongering going on." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>

He suggests that an earlier engagement with the potential of new tools could allow for better guidance and "course correcting" before issues escalate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Ultimately, an optimistic outlook can empower people to feel they can contribute to making the world better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## "Let Me Explain": Show Format and Vision

Each episode of "Let Me Explain" will take a single "big idea" and explore its potential if it were to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This includes considering:
*   What such a world would look like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>
*   What actions are needed to ensure it benefits the most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>
*   How it compares to the current status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>
*   What positive outcomes could emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>

Harris emphasizes that the show will be a personal and experimental endeavor, reflecting his own "tone of voice" and grappling with these questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. He will feature [[interviews_with_tech_innovators_shaping_the_future | experts]] such as Matt Yglesias, David Roberts, Dr. Tia Jackson-Bey, and Alexis Ohanian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The show also invites audience participation, encouraging viewers to suggest topics that make them pessimistic or overwhelmed for exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

The goal is to investigate potential solutions to global challenges and identify the best ways to solve them, acknowledging that while success isn't guaranteed, the potential impact of these ideas is immense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

Journalist Johnny Harris has launched a new show titled "Let Me Explain," which aims to offer "journalistically rigorous, genuinely optimistic explanations about technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The series is envisioned as "like Black Mirror, but the opposite, and journalism," intending to explore ideas that could lead to a positive future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Each episode will be a deep dive into an idea with the potential to significantly impact lives if it materializes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Critiquing Traditional Media Approaches to New Ideas

Harris, a video journalist who previously worked for Vox for five years covering tech and economics, including for Vox’s Netflix show *Explained* and its YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, highlights a historical pattern in how new ideas are discussed. He cites a newspaper article from October 9, 1903, titled "Flying Machines Which Do Not Fly," which posited that it would take "from one million to ten million years" to evolve a flying machine that could truly fly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Just two months later, the Wright brothers achieved their famous assisted flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

This example illustrates a common media pattern when discussing new concepts:
*   "It’s not possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>
*   "It’s too expensive, they can’t get the cost down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>
*   "Do people really need that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>
*   "Oh, it’s just a fad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>
*   Followed eventually by "Oh my god, it changed the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>

Harris notes that journalists often "love to shit on new ideas as implausible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, partly because such stories are often "easier to tell" and popular with readers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. He questions what valuable ideas might be overlooked due to this tendency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## The Impact of Pessimistic Narratives

Harris observes a widespread feeling, particularly evident on platforms like TikTok, that the world is not a good place and is getting worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This sentiment is fueled by real problems and a "lucrative fear mongering going on" in media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Examples of this include dramatic headlines about climate change and a "lazy new world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

Harris highlights the paradox: media narratives often dismiss potential solutions and portray a bleak future, then express surprise when young people exhibit pessimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This can lead to feelings of helplessness and powerlessness, making it "incredibly difficult to remain optimistic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This phenomenon directly impacts [[public_perceptions_of_global_issues | public perceptions of global issues]].

## The Need for Optimistic Journalism

Harris argues that while a journalist's role includes skepticism and pointing out challenges, there's also a responsibility "to help people imagine what could go right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of [[engagement_with_new_possibilities_in_journalism | rigorously engaging with the possibility]] of positive change earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This approach could lead to:
*   Better guidance for new tools early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>
*   Collective course-correction before issues escalate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>
*   Empowering people to feel they can contribute to making the world better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>

## "Let Me Explain": A New Direction

Harris decided to go independent and launch "Let Me Explain" as part of his [[transition_from_vox_to_independent_journalism | transition from Vox to independent journalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. The new show will explore a "big idea" in each episode, imagining its successful implementation, and addressing questions such as:
*   What would that world look like? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>
*   What is needed to ensure it helps the most people? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>
*   How does it compare to the status quo? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>
*   What could go right? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>

This independent format allows for a more personal, experimental tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. The show will feature insights from experts, other journalists, and actively seeks audience participation by inviting questions about topics that cause pessimism or overwhelm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. The goal is to investigate these topics and find potential solutions, even if success isn't guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

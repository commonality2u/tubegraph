The release of the [[first_images_from_the_james_webb_space_telescope | first images from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)]] in full color marked "the dawn of a new era" in space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Among these breathtaking images, one specific image of an exoplanet named WASP 96b stands out as particularly significant, as it shows humanity's potential to discover life beyond Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## The Search for Exoplanets

An exoplanet is defined as a planet located outside of our solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Approximately 5,000 such exoplanets have been identified to date, with potentially many more awaiting discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The Kepler telescope, for instance, focused on a specific region for four years, revealing a multitude of these distant worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The mapping of these exoplanets represents decades of scientific work and significant technological advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Despite this progress, the current understanding suggests no one else is currently "home" in our cosmic neighborhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Detecting [[significance_of_detecting_biosignatures | Biosignatures]] with JWST

Identifying a planet's presence is challenging, let alone determining its composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. However, the JWST is capable of detecting indicators of life, known as [[significance_of_detecting_biosignatures | biosignatures]], on other planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. For example, if one could analyze Earth's atmosphere from a great distance and detect 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, it would be a strong indicator of the presence of life, though not necessarily intelligent life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### [[exoplanet_discovery_through_starlight_dips | Exoplanet Discovery Through Starlight Dips]] and Atmospheric Composition

The method employed by JWST relies on the principle of [[exoplanet_discovery_through_starlight_dips | exoplanet discovery through starlight dips]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. When an exoplanet passes between its star and Earth, it causes a slight reduction, or "dip," in the starlight observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. While the planet blocks most of the light, a small amount passes through its atmosphere on its way to us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Different gases within that atmosphere absorb different wavelengths of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The JWST is powerful enough to analyze this light and identify which wavelengths are "missing," thereby revealing the atmospheric composition of the exoplanet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This process involves detecting "tiny, tiny specks of darkness against tiny, tiny specks of light in the depths of space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## WASP 96b: A Case Study

The JWST was specifically pointed at WASP 96b, a gas giant exoplanet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Light from WASP 96b began its journey 1,150 years ago, only just reaching the new telescope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. By analyzing the blocked light in its spectrum, scientists confirmed the presence of water in WASP 96b's atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

However, this detection does not signify the discovery of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. WASP 96b is a hot, steamy gas giant, meaning the water found is in the form of water vapor rather than liquid water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. While water vapor has been detected on other planets closer to Earth (a few hundred light-years away) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, the fact that JWST provided such detailed atmospheric information for a planet over 1,000 light-years away is groundbreaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This successful observation serves as a "proof of concept" that this method of searching for atmospheric compositions works, marking just the beginning of what the JWST can achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

The ability to analyze the atmospheres of distant exoplanets represents an incredibly exciting moment in scientific history, bringing humanity closer to potentially answering the question of whether we are alone in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

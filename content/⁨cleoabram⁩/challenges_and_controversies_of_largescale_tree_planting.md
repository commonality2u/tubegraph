Large-scale tree planting initiatives, while often seen as a straightforward solution to climate change, face several challenges and controversies. While mass tree planting is considered a "step in the right direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> and "all the help we can get" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, its effectiveness is limited unless accompanied by reduced greenhouse gas emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Limitations of Traditional Tree Planting for Carbon Capture

One primary challenge is the sheer scale required for traditional tree planting to significantly impact global carbon emissions. To account for human carbon emissions, an estimated one trillion trees would need to be planted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This massive number could potentially be reduced to "a little bit above 500 billion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a> if trees had an enhanced ability to draw down carbon.

## The Fast Carbon Cycle and Decomposition

A key controversy surrounding traditional tree planting relates to the "fast" carbon cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. While trees absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis, reducing atmospheric CO2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, much of this carbon is released back into the atmosphere within a few years when leaves fall or the tree dies and decomposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. This contrasts with the "slow" carbon cycle involved in fossil fuels, where CO2 is released from biomass trapped deep underground for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Therefore, planting trees that only participate in the fast cycle is insufficient; efforts are needed to ensure trees can contribute more to long-term carbon sequestration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## Ecological Impact and Invasive Species

Another significant concern is the ecological impact of planting trees, particularly non-native species. Planting trees that grow quickly but are not native to an environment can worsen the carbon problem by disrupting the delicate balance of existing plants, microbes, and soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This raises the risk of creating invasive species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

The goal for some researchers, such as Living Carbon, is not to plant their specific genetically engineered trees everywhere but to enhance photosynthesis in plants native to their respective environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. They believe in making their research on [[genetic_engineering_for_enhanced_carbon_capture_in_trees | photosynthetic efficiency]] publicly available to inspire others to work on improving the carbon capture of native trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. This approach aims to avoid the pitfalls associated with introducing non-native or invasive species.

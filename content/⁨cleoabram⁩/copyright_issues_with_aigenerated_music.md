The rise of [[ai_in_music_creation | AI music]] has sparked a complex and controversial debate within the music industry, particularly concerning copyright and artist compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>. This shift raises two primary questions: what can AI music do, and when should artists be paid in this new landscape? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:10">[02:04:10]</a>

## The Challenge of AI Voice Clones

Recent advancements in AI allow for realistic [[voice_cloning_with_ai | AI voice clones]] of famous artists, such as Frank Sinatra singing "Get Low" or Johnny Cash singing "Barbie Girl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This technology enables the creation of entirely new songs as "fake collaborations" or the rapid generation of lyrics and melodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. While exciting, this development makes the music industry "very nervous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>, with some predicting that [[impact_of_ai_on_the_music_industry | AI is going to be "the death of music"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. The stakes are high: if mishandled, it could [[challenges_and_concerns_of_ai_replacing_artists | jeopardize how human musicians make money and art]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

## Existing Copyright Framework in Music

The music industry already has established rules for compensation based on whether new music is considered inspiration or direct copying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

### Inspiration vs. Copying

*   **Inspiration**: Most music falls into the category of inspiration, where artists are influenced by others without requiring payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.
*   **Direct Copying with Payment**: This is also acceptable and includes:
    *   **Sampling**: Using a piece of an original recording, requiring payment for the composition and recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. Doja Cat's "Paint The Town Red" samples Dionne Warwick's "Walk On By" as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.
    *   **Interpolation**: Re-recording a line or melody from another song, requiring payment to the original composer but not for the original recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. Ariana Grande's "7 Rings" interpolates "My Favorite Things" from *The Sound of Music* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.
    *   **Covering**: Re-recording an entire song, requiring payment to the original composer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. Miley Cyrus's cover of "Jolene" illustrates this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>.

In all these cases, if an [[ai_in_music_creation | AI tool]] is used to create such works, the original owner must still be paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. Copyright protects both the original song recording (master) and the composition itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.

### Legal Precedents

Copyright law is often defined by lawsuits:
*   In 2015, Pharrell Williams and Robin Thicke paid $5 million after "Blurred Lines" was found to copy Marvin Gaye's "Got to Give It Up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>.
*   Ed Sheeran won a lawsuit regarding a chord progression in "Thinking Out Loud" that was claimed to copy "Let's Get It On" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.
*   Olivia Rodrigo retroactively gave Taylor Swift songwriting credits due to accusations of song similarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.

## AI and Copyright: New Challenges

The main challenge for copyright in the age of AI lies in determining whether an [[ai_in_music_creation | AI]] training on existing music constitutes inspiration or copying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.

### Training Data and Output

[[ai_in_music_creation | AI tools]] require vast datasets of thousands of songs to learn from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. These tools don't merely collage pieces of existing music; instead, they analyze patterns to create entirely new works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. Currently, the industry's decision on payment is based on the *output* (how similar the final product sounds), not the *input* (whether copyrighted music was used for training) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>. This means artists are paid if the end result sounds enough like them, regardless of the tools used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>. Changing this would mean paying artists for "inspiration," a concept not yet established in copyright law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.

### Voice Cloning and Consent

Grimes has embraced [[voice_cloning_with_ai | AI voice cloning]] with her "Elf Tech" tool, which allows anyone to use her voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. She plans to release an AI-made album alongside her own, allowing others to create songs with her voice and pay her royalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. However, many artists are "extremely not okay" with their voices being used without consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>, emphasizing the need for consent and copyright protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

### Spotify's Stance

Daniel Ek, CEO of Spotify, stated that Spotify wouldn't know what tools artists use to create their music, as they only receive audio files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. He acknowledges the debate over AI training data but emphasizes that the "more important one is the output of that training" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>. He draws the line when [[ai_in_music_creation | AI-generated music]] becomes "confusingly similar" and drafts off someone else's name and likeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.

## The Future: Autonomous AI as Creator

A more existential question arises if [[ai_in_music_creation | AI]] begins to make music more autonomously, becoming less a tool and more an "artist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>. Autonomous [[ai_in_music_creation | AI agents]] could generate millions or even billions of songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>. In such a scenario, it becomes unclear who owns the intellectual property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>. While the AI itself wouldn't be considered a creator, the person behind the AI likely would <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>.

### Impact on Human Creativity

Despite concerns that [[impact_of_ai_on_human_creativity | AI might hurt human creativity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>, it can potentially help bridge the "gap" between an imagined musical idea and what can be realistically created with available tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. Creativity isn't the same as technical skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. By lowering the technical skill required for expression, [[future_of_ai_as_a_tool_for_artists | AI acts as a new, powerful tool]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>, similar to how computers became a tool for artists like Avicii <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

### Conclusion

Ultimately, while many details still need to be figured out regarding fair compensation for musicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>, [[ai_in_music_creation | AI]] has the potential to expand human expression and connection through music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>, enabling those who "may not have believed that they had a musical talent" to realize they do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>. This aligns with the [[role_of_ai_in_democratizing_art_access | role of AI in democratizing art access]].

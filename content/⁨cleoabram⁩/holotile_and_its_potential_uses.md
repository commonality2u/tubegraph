The Holotile is an innovative omnidirectional treadmill invented by famous Walt Disney Imagineer, Lanny Smoot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:13">[09:52:13]</a>. It functions as a floor that allows a user to walk in any direction while remaining in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:57">[09:53:57]</a>.

## How it Works

The Holotile floor is composed of numerous rotating circular tiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:33">[10:07:33]</a>. Each tile features two gears: one on the bottom controlling its overall spin, and another on top dictating the angle of its head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:30">[10:11:30]</a>. When a user steps on the surface, their shoe interacts with the top of these angled discs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:79">[10:17:79]</a>. As the user walks in one direction, the spin of the angled discs' tops pushes them in the opposite direction, creating a sensation of the ground moving beneath them, drifting them back toward the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:17">[10:30:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:33">[10:37:33]</a>.

To track movement, the entire surface is surrounded by lidar cameras that constantly scan the user's feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:0">[11:11:0]</a>. A camera at floor level identifies the foot's position on the tiles, tracking each step in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:21">[11:17:21]</a>. A second camera determines the foot's direction by identifying both the foot's location and the position of the shin bone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:82">[11:21:82]</a>. In a demonstration setup, six different lidar angles ensured a clear view of the feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:17">[11:33:17]</a>.

Alternatively, the Holotile floor can also be controlled using a video game controller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:73">[11:49:73]</a>.

## Current and Future Applications

Currently, Walt Disney Imagineers are utilizing the Holotile for testing new designs and playing games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:65">[12:07:65]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:68">[12:09:68]</a>. While its exact future uses are still being explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:30">[12:05:30]</a>, it has been implied that it might eventually be incorporated into Disney parks or potentially used in movie filming environments, such as "the Volume" where Star Wars films are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:44">[12:12:44]</a>.

Ultimately, the primary purpose of the Holotile, at least for now, is simply to provide fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:77">[12:03:77]</a>.

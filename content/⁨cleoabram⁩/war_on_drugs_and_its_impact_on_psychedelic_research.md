Before the advent of the [[the_impact_of_fear_mongering_in_media | War on Drugs]], psychedelics were legal in both the UK and the US in 1955 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This period saw them as an exciting area of medical research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Historically, substances like psilocybin mushrooms and peyote (containing mescaline) were used in religious rituals by Maya and Aztec people, and continue to be part of some modern religious ceremonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. In the early 1900s, psychedelics were legal and available in the United States, with companies even sending LSD directly to doctors for use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

By the 1960s, psychedelics became associated with the counter-culture, spiritual enlightenment, and the "Summer of Love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. As more people started using these drugs, negative headlines emerged, leading to a shift in public opinion from one of curiosity to widespread fear and distrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

## The Declaration of the War on Drugs

The situation dramatically changed by the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The United States declared a "War on Drugs," with President Reagan proclaiming drug abuse as "America's public enemy number one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This policy initiative aimed to wage "total war against dangerous drugs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. As a result, most psychedelics became illegal, and research into them took a much darker turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. For about 40 years, most psychedelics remained illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Impact on Psychedelic Research

The [[historical_legal_status_of_psychedelics | ban on psychedelics]] was largely a "socio-political phenomenon" rather than being supported by scientific evidence of their dangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. These drugs became so strongly associated with the counter-culture that they were "forbidden even for researchers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

Research conducted during this era often supported the government-backed narrative that psychedelics were extremely dangerous, solidifying public opinion in favor of the War on Drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. However, it is now known that not all of this research was accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

### The Monkey Study Debacle

One notable example is a 2002 study published in the prestigious *Science* journal by Johns Hopkins researchers, which investigated the effects of ecstasy on monkey brains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. The media publicized the shocking finding that just one night of ecstasy use could lead to permanent brain damage, with quotes like "Using ecstasy is like playing Russian roulette with your brain function" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. The study also reported that 20% of the animals tested died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

However, a year later, the same researchers retracted their study, revealing they had accidentally injected the monkeys with meth instead of ecstasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Despite the retraction, the damage was already done, impacting public understanding of psychedelics for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. This highlights the crucial importance of how early science and technology are framed, as it can shape perceptions for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## The Tide Begins to Change

The period of "deep freeze" for psychedelic research has largely ended in the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. There is a new and growing fight to make psychedelics legal again in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. These substances are once more an interesting area of study, with researchers suggesting [[potential_health_benefits_and_therapeutic_applications_of_psychedelics | major health benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

[[Current_research_and_scientific_understanding_of_psychedelics | Modern research]] is now uncovering how psychedelics work, particularly by acting on the 2A serotonin receptor in the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. The term "psychedelic" itself, derived from Greek words, loosely translates to "mind manifesting," reflecting their ability to profoundly change perception of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

Researchers like Dr. Matthew Johnson, a professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Johns Hopkins and a leading figure in the field, have been studying psychedelics since 2004, focusing on their mechanisms and potential therapeutic applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

Recent studies show promising results:
*   One high dose of psilocybin relieved anxiety and depression in cancer patients for six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   Two-thirds of patients treated with MDMA no longer experienced PTSD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

Psychedelics are believed to help with various disorders because they can alter conversations between individual brain cells, essentially "rewiring" how the brain processes emotions or desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

Despite the excitement, researchers emphasize that psychedelics are not for everyone, especially those with a family history of schizophrenia, as they could trigger manic or psychotic episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. However, the potential to treat conditions like PTSD (affecting 5% of US adults annually, or 13 million people in 2020) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a> and major depressive disorder (affecting 8% of US adults) is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

The [[psychedelic_legalization_and_regulation_debate | debate around legalization]] today is largely focused on supervised settings, often prescribed by a doctor with a licensed therapist supervising the "trip" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. MDMA is projected to be FDA approved for PTSD within a year or two, followed by psilocybin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. States like Oregon and Colorado have legalized psilocybin for use in supervised "healing centers" with facilitators, not necessarily doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

The story of psychedelics is a "classic tale of trying to control something that we don't fully understand, creating a narrative of fear and distrust that drove researchers away, stifling decades of innovation and progress that could have potentially helped millions of people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. However, the last decade has seen a more measured approach, moving beyond public perception to focus on the science and the potential to help millions struggling with health conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

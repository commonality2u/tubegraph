A common misconception is that all dinosaurs lived at the same time and went extinct simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Dinosaurs ruled the Earth for an immense period of 180 million years, vastly longer than recorded human history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. The dinosaurs we commonly recognize were spread throughout this enormous history, meaning some well-known species were separated by millions of years; for example, more time separates the Stegosaurus from the T-Rex than separates the T-Rex from humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

## The K-Pg Extinction Event

Approximately 66.04 million years ago, a catastrophic event led to the demise of many dinosaur species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. This event began with a massive rock, wider than Mount Everest is tall, traveling at 20 to 30 kilometers per second, striking Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. The impact occurred in a specific location and was so powerful it vaporized the space rock instantly, catapulting chunks of Earth beyond the atmosphere, potentially even reaching the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.

### Immediate Aftermath
The impact created an apocalypse on the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. Key immediate consequences included:
*   **Thermal Pulse** A wave of intense heat swept across the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.
*   **Mega Tsunamis** Enormous tsunamis rippled across the entire globe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

### Global Consequences
For any dinosaurs that survived the immediate impact, the worst was yet to come: the entire planet was plunged into darkness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.
*   **Sunlight Blocked** Ejecta from the impact blocked out the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.
*   **Ecological Collapse** With significantly reduced sunlight, plants died, leading to the collapse of the food chain as animals that ate plants, and then animals that ate those animals, also perished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

### Survivors of the Extinction
The creatures that survived this cataclysm were generally small, about the size of a German Shepherd or smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. They often had some form of refugia, meaning they could take shelter in water or live underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

It was an incredibly terrifying period, and the fact that anything survived is considered remarkable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.

## Impact on Earth's History and Life
After 180 million years, the reign of the dominant non-avian dinosaurs concluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. While this was a devastating event for many dinosaur species, it was a "really great day for mammals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. Humans exist today because of this extinction event, which allowed for the diversification and rise of mammals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

Paleontology, the study of ancient life, helps us understand how life on Earth has evolved and where it might be headed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. The current era is considered a [[discoveries_in_dinosaur_paleontology | Golden Age of dinosaur discovery]], with ongoing research revealing new insights into these amazing creatures and their history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.

### What is a Dinosaur?
Scientifically, the definition of a dinosaur is phylogenetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. It includes all descendants from a specific branch in the evolutionary tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. This means that some animals often mistakenly called dinosaurs, such as Pterosaurs, Mosasaurs, Plesiosaurs, and Ichthyosaurs, are actually different groups of reptiles that lived at the same time but branched off earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Crocodiles were also alive during the dinosaur era but are not considered dinosaurs as they branched off earlier as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

Crucially, under this scientific definition, [[the_connection_between_birds_and_dinosaurs | birds are dinosaurs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. They are not merely descendants of dinosaurs but are actual dinosaurs themselves, meaning dinosaurs are still alive and all around us today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

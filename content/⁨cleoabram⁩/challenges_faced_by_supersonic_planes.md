For a period, [[history_and_legacy_of_supersonic_flight | supersonic travel]] was a reality, with the Concorde flying at twice the speed of sound, completing trips from New York to London in 3.5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Passengers could experience seeing the curve of the Earth while enjoying champagne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. However, these planes stopped flying, and today, the same journey takes 7 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The decline of commercial supersonic flight was due to a combination of significant challenges.

## The Sonic Boom Problem

The primary challenge for supersonic planes is the sonic boom they create when flying faster than the speed of sound (Mach 1), which is approximately 767 mph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### How it Works
As a plane flies, it pushes air out of its path, creating pressure waves at its front and back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. When a plane exceeds the speed of sound, air molecules cannot move out of the way in time, causing them to compress and form waves at the front and back of the aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. When these pressure waves reach human ears, they are perceived as a "massive BOOM" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

> [!NOTE] A common misconception is that a sonic boom occurs only once when a plane breaks the sound barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. In reality, the boom continuously "booooooooms" along the entire flight path, carpeting the ground below the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Inside the plane, however, the boom is not heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Regulatory Impact
The Concorde's sonic boom was comparable in loudness to a balloon pop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Due to the disruptive noise, the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) banned commercial supersonic flights over the United States in 1973, with similar regulations following worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This severely limited flight routes, mainly allowing supersonic flights only over oceans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

## Economic and Public Perception Challenges

Beyond the sonic boom, other factors contributed to the Concorde's retirement:
*   **Fuel Consumption:** The Concorde's engines were "fuel guzzling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, and rising fuel costs made operations increasingly expensive.
*   **High Ticket Prices:** The cost of flying supersonic was not cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, limiting its accessibility to a niche market.
*   **Public Perception:** A deadly crash in 2000 severely impacted public reception of supersonic flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Aging Fleet:** As the planes aged, the cost of upkeep became unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. British Airways eventually retired its Concorde fleet in early 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

## Addressing the Sonic Boom: [[nasas_x59_supersonic_plane_development | NASA's X-59 Supersonic Plane Development]]

NASA is actively working to overcome the sonic boom challenge with its experimental X-59 plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The X-59 is designed to prove that supersonic planes can be quiet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

### Design [[innovations_in_aircraft_design | Innovations]] for Quiet Supersonic Flight
The X-59 incorporates features seen in the Concorde, such as large delta wings and a streamlined body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, but with significant modifications:
*   **Extended Nose:** The X-59 features a much longer, 38-foot carbon fiber nose that remains fixed during flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This design helps reduce the sonic boom by creating a smaller "splash" of sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Due to the fixed nose, the pilot relies on a live video feed from a front-mounted camera for visibility during takeoff and landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Smooth Underside:** The bottom of the aircraft is designed to be very smooth and clean, directing any potential shockwaves upward, away from the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **T-Tail Design:** A unique T-tail creates its own shockwave that interacts with and cancels out some of the boom from the back of the airplane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **Anti-Static Paint:** The plane is coated with a special anti-static paint to prevent the build-up of static electricity as it moves through the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

NASA's goal is to achieve a sound level of around 75 perceived level dB, which would sound similar to a neighbor closing a car door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. If successful, this could lead to a change in regulations, allowing supersonic flight over land as long as the sound level remains below a specified threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

## The [[future_of_commercial_supersonic_travel | Future of Commercial Supersonic Travel]]

While the X-59 is an experimental, single-seater jet not intended for commercial passengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>, its breakthroughs are aimed at paving the way for future commercial supersonic planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

### Remaining Hurdles
Even with NASA's efforts to mitigate the sonic boom, several challenges remain for the return of widespread commercial supersonic passenger flight:
*   **Regulatory Process:** Testing the X-59 and going through the regulatory process will take several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. It is anticipated that commercial supersonic planes are at least a decade away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
*   **Sustainability:** New supersonic planes need to be more sustainable and cannot consume fuel at the rates of their predecessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
*   **Affordability:** Future supersonic travel needs to be cheaper to attract a wider market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   **Passenger Capacity:** Commercial models will need to accommodate more than just one passenger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

Despite these hurdles, there is significant confidence in the industry, with private companies like Boom aiming to bring their planes to market by the end of the decade, and three airlines already placing orders for future supersonic aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

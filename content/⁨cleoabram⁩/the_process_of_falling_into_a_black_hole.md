Imagine being dragged toward a dark abyss where reality begins to change, time warps, and you feel a strange sensation of being stretched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This is the experience of falling into a [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, one of the most astonishing places in our universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## What is a Black Hole?

A [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]] forms when a star, even one the mass of our sun, collapses and squashes down until its radius becomes incredibly small, like 3 km <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. If all that mass were artificially squashed into such a tiny space, the gravity at its surface would be immense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. To escape its gravitational pull, the escape velocity would need to exceed the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This means even light emitted from the surface would be trapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. A [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]] is defined as a spot so massive with gravity so strong that not even light can escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

Initially, [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black holes]] were considered a mathematical quirk, a theoretical solution to equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. However, over decades, scientists observed the movement of stars, galaxies, and gases warped by seemingly empty patches of space, which were the remnants of collapsing stars much larger than our sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This confirmed that [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black holes]] are real and are found throughout our universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, with estimates suggesting up to 40 quintillion of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Nearly every galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]] at its center, such as Sagittarius A\* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

### Sizing Up Black Holes

[[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | Black holes]] vary greatly in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>:
*   **J1650**: One of the smallest discovered, its diameter is only about as long as Manhattan but has a mass 3.8 times our sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Messier 15**: About twice the diameter of Earth with a mass of 4,000 suns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   **Lower limit of supermassive**: Just under half the diameter of our sun but 100,000 times its mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Sagittarius A\***: The supermassive [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]] at the center of our galaxy, it has a mass of 4.3 million times our sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. If placed in our solar system, it would only extend to about 1/5 Mercury's average orbit, making it shockingly small for its immense mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **M87**: Weighs 5.4 billion suns and could fit our solar system four times across it. It was the first one ever pictured in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Ton 618**: One of the largest discovered, weighing 66 billion times more than our sun and capable of fitting nearly 40 of our solar systems across it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Phoenix A**: Seems to have a mass of 100 billion suns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## Approaching the Abyss: An Outside Perspective

As one approaches a [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]], if observed from far away with an all-powerful telescope, something peculiar happens:
*   **Time Dilation**: An external observer would see time tick more and more slowly for the falling object, eventually appearing to stop on the horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **No Crossing**: From the perspective of someone outside, nothing ever truly goes into the [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Redshift**: The light from the falling object would be stretched as it climbs through the intense gravitational field, becoming redder and redder until it is infinitely redshifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

This phenomenon occurs because [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black holes]] drastically distort [[how_black_holes_warp_space_and_time | space and time]] near them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. [[einsteins_theory_of_relativity_and_black_holes | Albert Einstein]] realized that space and time are actually one entity, spacetime, which is stretchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Spacetime warps or curves in response to matter and energy, and a [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]] represents the most extreme example of this distortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. The math indicates that reality very close to and very far from a [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]] are not the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

## Inside the Black Hole: The Inevitable Journey

From the perspective of someone falling into a [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]], the experience is quite different:
*   **Free Fall**: Initially, there's no feeling of being pulled or pushed; one is simply in free fall, similar to astronauts on the International Space Station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Even when crossing the event horizon (the point of no return where light cannot escape), there's no immediate sensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   **Spaghettification**: As one falls deeper, gravity increases rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. The gravitational force at one's feet becomes so different from that at one's head that the body begins to stretch dramatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This phenomenon, known as spaghettification, also involves a squashing effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. As one gets closer to the [[the_mystery_of_singularities_and_the_beginning_of_the_universe | singularity]], these effects become so extreme that the body ceases to stay together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Atoms, then protons, and eventually quarks are ripped apart, leaving "everything gone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

### The Singularity

All the ripped-apart pieces continue racing inward toward the [[the_mystery_of_singularities_and_the_beginning_of_the_universe | singularity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. While tempting to picture it as an infinitely dense point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, because a [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]] is a distortion of [[how_black_holes_warp_space_and_time | spacetime]], the [[the_mystery_of_singularities_and_the_beginning_of_the_universe | singularity]] is not just a place but also "a moment in time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. In [[einsteins_theory_of_relativity_and_black_holes | Einstein's theory]], it represents the end of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. For anything that crosses the event horizon, escaping the [[the_mystery_of_singularities_and_the_beginning_of_the_universe | singularity]] is like trying to "escape tomorrow" – it's in the future and inescapable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

## Can Anything Escape? The Information Paradox

According to [[einsteins_theory_of_relativity_and_black_holes | Einstein's theory]], once you've been ripped to bits and fallen into the infinitely distorted [[how_black_holes_warp_space_and_time | space and time]], it's simply "done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. However, [[Hawking radiation and information paradox | Stephen Hawking]] discovered that "black holes ain't so black" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   **[[Hawking radiation and information paradox | Hawking Radiation]]**: [[Hawking radiation and information paradox | Hawking]] found that particles are emitted from the [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]], giving it a temperature and causing it to glow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. This means [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black holes]] lose energy and have a finite lifetime, eventually disappearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
*   **The [[Theories on Black Hole Information Paradox | Information Paradox]]**: This led to a profound problem. All known laws of the universe state that information is conserved; it can be scrambled but not destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. If a [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]] eventually evaporates, what happens to all the information about what fell in? [[Hawking]]'s initial calculation suggested the radiation was information-free, implying that any record of what fell in would be erased, which contradicted fundamental laws of nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

### Recent Discoveries and Theories

[[Recent Discoveries and Theories in Black Hole Physics | Cutting-edge research]], particularly a series of papers published in 2019, suggests that [[Hawking]] "missed a bit" in his calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. It turns out that the radiation is *not* information-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. At the end of the process, all the information about everything that fell in is imprinted in the radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

This resolution, however, creates new complexities:
*   How does information, which went to the [[the_mystery_of_singularities_and_the_beginning_of_the_universe | singularity]] and the end of time, get out again as radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>?
*   There is no agreed-upon picture yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. One description suggests that the interior of the [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]] is in some sense the same place as the exterior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. This could involve "wormholes opening up from the interior of the [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]] to the exterior" through which bits of information might travel, ending up in the [[Hawking radiation and information paradox | Hawking radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.
*   Other theories propose that one never truly goes "in" a [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]], or that everything is just information with no real place at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
*   The universe might be describable as a "giant quantum computer" or a "network of entangled qubits," a concept still under debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

These ongoing investigations into [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black holes]] are at the [[Recent Discoveries and Theories in Black Hole Physics | cutting edge of research]] and hint at something fundamental about the nature of [[how_black_holes_warp_space_and_time | space and time]] themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. Their extreme nature pushes the limits of our understanding, revealing the hidden structure of reality that governs everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. Studying collapsed stars provides insight into concepts like quantum computers and quantum information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>, continually deepening our sense of awe and mystery about the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.

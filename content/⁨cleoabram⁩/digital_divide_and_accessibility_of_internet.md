The internet, a marvel of human ingenuity, has profoundly shaped modern society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. However, despite its widespread presence for many, a significant portion of the global population still lacks adequate access, creating a [[challenges_of_existing_internet_infrastructure | Digital Divide]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.

## Current State of Internet Infrastructure

The vast majority of current international internet traffic travels through over 800,000 miles of cables crisscrossing the oceans, with roughly 436 in service as of 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. These underwater fiber optic cables carry information as flashes of light, converting binary "1s and 0s" into visible light signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. Laying these cables is a slow and extensive process, taking weeks for ships to weave a literal web around the world at speeds as low as 7 miles per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. While impressive, this infrastructure faces significant limitations regarding accessibility.

## The Digital Divide

The "Digital Divide" refers to the disparity in internet access, not only between countries but also within them, including rural areas and even within communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. This divide primarily stems from two core problems: accessibility and affordability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>.

### Challenges to Universal Access

*   **Geographical Barriers**: In some places, it is prohibitively difficult to lay physical cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>. Even when feasible, companies may deem it financially unviable to lay cables in rural communities due to fewer potential paying customers, leading to higher charges where service is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.
*   **Political and Conflict Instability**: Ground-based internet service can be threatened by politics or war, as seen in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>.
*   **Misleading Data**: Official estimates of internet access often wildly underestimate the problem. For example, the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) reported that about 14 million people lacked fast internet, based on self-reported data from Internet Service Providers (ISPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. However, this data is flawed because if an ISP provides service to anyone in a census block, they can count the entire block as covered, even if nearly 800 people in that block do not have access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. Microsoft's estimates, in contrast, indicate over 120 million people in the US lack access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>.

## The Role of Satellite Internet in Addressing the Divide

The need to bridge the [[challenges_of_existing_internet_infrastructure | Digital Divide]] is driving the [[the_great_internet_space_race | Great Internet Space Race]], with billionaires like Elon Musk (Starlink), Jeff Bezos (Project Kuiper), and Richard Branson (OneWeb) investing in satellite internet constellations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. These companies aim to make the internet better, cheaper, and more widely available, particularly to the millions underserved by existing providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>.

### How New Satellite Systems Differ

Unlike older satellite systems (e.g., HughesNet, Viasat) that place satellites very high and stationary, resulting in high latency, new projects like Starlink employ thousands of satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>. While this requires more satellites to cover the same area, it significantly reduces latency, making satellite internet more competitive with fiber optic cables in terms of speed and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>. Starlink, for instance, already offers surprisingly high bandwidth and low latency for a satellite system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>. These satellites also use visible light between them, similar to fiber cables, giving them a potential advantage in speed due to light traveling faster in the vacuum of space than in glass cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>.

> "The goal here is broadband everywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>

These systems have already proven crucial in crisis situations, such as Elon Musk's announcement that Starlink was activated in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>.

### Challenges of Satellite Constellations

While promising, the proliferation of LEO satellites poses challenges, particularly for astronomers. The sheer number of satellites (potentially tens of thousands) can interfere with ground-based astronomy, which is vital for understanding the universe and for planetary defense against asteroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>. Solutions are needed to ensure both universal internet access and the ability to study the cosmos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>.

## [[Technological advancements and future potential | Impact of Universal Internet Access]]

Solving the [[challenges_of_existing_internet_infrastructure | Digital Divide]] by making internet access better, faster, *and* cheaper holds significant [[technological_advancements_and_future_potential | societal implications]]. Historically, technology has turned luxuries into commodities, making them accessible to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:00">[14:28:00]</a>. Research indicates that increased internet access leads to:
*   Job growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>
*   More new businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>
*   Reduced unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>
*   Improved health outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>
*   Better access to [[educational_and_societal_implications_of_ai_advancements | education]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>

The COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted the critical importance of internet access for participation in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>. New satellite systems, alongside continued investment in existing infrastructure, are crucial components in continuing this progress towards a more connected world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:00">[14:54:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>.

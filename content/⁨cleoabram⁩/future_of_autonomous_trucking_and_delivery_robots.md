The realm of [[current_state_of_selfdriving_cars | self-driving cars]] extends beyond passenger vehicles, with significant advancements in [[future_of_freight_and_delivery_with_electric_planes | autonomous trucking]] and delivery robots already impacting the landscape of logistics and transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. While the [[impact_of_selfdriving_cars_on_society_and_transportation | sci-fi vision]] of go-anywhere, fully autonomous vehicles remains a distant goal, the current "messy middle" is witnessing the emergence of two distinct, constrained approaches to self-driving technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>.

## Current State and Vision

The development of autonomous vehicles is not a simple "binary switch" but a gradual progression with various [[levels_of_automation_in_selfdriving_technology | levels of self-driving-ness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. Current advancements allow for full self-driving capabilities within specific constraints, such as on highways or in geographically defined areas where the vehicles have been extensively trained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

A key division in [[impact_of_selfdriving_cars_on_society_and_transportation | self-driving technology]] is "whether to carry people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. This leads to two major, distinct visions:

*   **Delivery Robots (Cities, No People)**: These robots operate in complex urban environments but do not transport human passengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Distance Autonomous Trucking (Highways, No People)**: This involves trucks moving goods over long distances without human drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>.

These two visions represent the most significant and different approaches to self-driving at the current level of technological advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.

## Autonomous Trucking

[[future_of_freight_and_delivery_with_electric_planes | Autonomous trucking]] is poised to revolutionize how goods are moved globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>. Companies are actively conducting deliveries with these self-driving trucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>. These vehicles offer significant advantages:
*   They do not require sleep, drink, or get distracted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.
*   They operate as politely as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>.
*   Autonomous trucks are expected to be on the roads soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>.

The impact of autonomous trucks is compared to the difference between a hundred people with shovels and an excavator, implying a massive increase in efficiency and capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.

## Societal Impact

The transition to autonomous vehicles, including trucks and delivery robots, is expected to bring profound changes:
*   **Safety**: Human driving currently involves significant risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>. Future generations may view human-driven transportation as "barbaric" given the risks, such as teenagers driving two-ton vehicles at high speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>.
*   **Efficiency and Time-Saving**: Autonomous transportation could give people back "an hour or more of their time" daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>. The notion of humans driving for days to deliver goods may soon seem antiquated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.

While a fully autonomous, go-anywhere [[impact_of_selfdriving_cars_on_society_and_transportation | sci-fi version of self-driving]] is not yet here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>, the advancements in [[selfdriving_tractors_and_farm_automation | autonomous trucking]] and delivery robots represent the impactful "messy middle" where the future is actively being made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>.

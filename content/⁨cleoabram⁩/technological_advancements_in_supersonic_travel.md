Supersonic commercial flight, once a reality, is a field currently experiencing renewed interest and significant [[technological_advancements_and_future_potential|technological advancements]] aimed at overcoming past limitations.

## A Brief History of Supersonic Flight

The world's first commercial supersonic flight was achieved by the Concorde, an aircraft capable of traveling at twice the speed of sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Twenty years ago, it was possible to fly faster than sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The [[history_and_demise_of_the_Concorde_supersonic_plane|Concorde]] could complete the journey from New York to London in just 3.5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. It flew at such high altitudes that passengers could observe the Earth's curvature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

However, these planes eventually ceased operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, leading to current New York to London flight times of approximately 7 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Understanding Supersonic Speed

Supersonic speed is defined as exceeding the speed of sound, which is around 767 mph, also known as Mach 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. For context:
*   The fastest train travels at approximately 286 mph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   The fastest car reaches about 330 mph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   An average Boeing 737 cruises at around 520 mph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   The Concorde achieved a top speed of 1,350 mph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, comparable to a military F-16 fighter jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## The Problem of the Sonic Boom

A major hurdle for supersonic flight is the [[challenges_and_solutions_for_reducing_sonic_booms|sonic boom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. When an aircraft flies faster than the speed of sound, air molecules cannot move out of the way fast enough, leading to compression and the formation of pressure waves at the front and back of the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. These waves are perceived as a loud "double bang" on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

A common misconception is that a sonic boom occurs only when a plane breaks the sound barrier; in reality, it continuously "booms" along the entire flight path, carpeting the ground below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. While passengers inside the plane do not hear the boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, it was significantly loud for those on the ground, similar to a balloon pop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

Due to the loud nature of sonic booms, the FAA banned commercial supersonic flights over the United States in 1973, with similar regulations following globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. This restriction largely limited flights to ocean routes, reducing profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Combined with high fuel consumption and a deadly crash in 2000, public perception of supersonic flight suffered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

## NASA's X-59 Supersonic Plane

NASA believes that commercial supersonic flight can return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. They are developing a new experimental supersonic plane, the [[nasas_x59_supersonic_plane_and_its_innovations|X-59]], built by Lockheed Martin at Skunkworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The X-59 is a single-seater jet designed to travel at 925 mph (Mach 1.4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. Its primary goal is to prove that supersonic planes can be quiet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

### Innovations for a Quiet Supersonic Flight

The [[nasas_x59_supersonic_plane_and_its_innovations|X-59]] incorporates design features found on the Concorde, such as large delta wings and a streamlined body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. However, it introduces several key innovations:
*   **Extended Nose:** The X-59 features a much longer, fixed 38-foot carbon fiber nose that does not move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Visibility System:** Since the nose is fixed, pilots cannot see directly out front during takeoff and landing. Instead, a camera at the front sends a live video feed to the pilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Boom Reduction Design:** The extended nose is crucial for reducing the sonic boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. The plane's design aims to minimize the "splash" of the sonic boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Upward Shockwave Diversion:** The underside of the X-59 is designed to be very smooth and clean, directing any potential shockwaves upward, away from people on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   **Boom Cancellation with T-tail:** A T-tail feature on the X-59 creates its own shockwave that interacts with and helps cancel out some of the remaining sonic boom from the rear of the aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   **Anti-Static Paint:** The aircraft is coated with special anti-static paint to prevent the buildup of static electricity as it moves through the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

NASA's goal is to reduce the sonic boom to approximately 75 perceived level decibels (PLdB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. This level is anticipated to be quiet enough to sound similar to a neighbor closing a car door, often imperceptible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

## The [[Future of supersonic commercial flight|Future of Supersonic Commercial Flight]]

The X-59 is a one-off experimental aircraft, not intended for passenger transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Its purpose is to demonstrate the feasibility of low-boom supersonic flight and enable a change in regulations that currently ban supersonic flights over land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

If NASA succeeds in changing these regulations, it could open the door for commercial supersonic planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. Several private companies, such as Boom, are actively working to bring back supersonic passenger flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

The timeline for widespread commercial supersonic travel is still some years away, with a decade being a conservative estimate, accounting for testing, community engagement, and the regulatory process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. However, the industry is confident, with three airlines already placing orders for future supersonic planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

### Challenges for Future Commercial Supersonic Planes
Beyond solving the sonic boom, future supersonic planes will need to address:
*   **Sustainability:** They must be more fuel-efficient and sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   **Cost:** Flights will need to be more affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   **Capacity:** They must be able to carry more than just one passenger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

Despite these [[challenges_and_solutions_for_reducing_sonic_booms|challenges]], there is strong belief that another supersonic airliner will serve the general public in the not-too-distant future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. The ability to travel farther and faster has historically led to greater global connection and exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

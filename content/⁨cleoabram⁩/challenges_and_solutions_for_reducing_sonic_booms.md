For a period, commercial air travel allowed passengers to fly faster than sound, notably with the Concorde aircraft, which could complete the New York to London journey in just 3.5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The Concorde flew at an altitude so high that passengers could see the curvature of the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Flying at 1,350 mph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, roughly the same top speed as a military F-16 fighter jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, the Concorde was an embodiment of human desire for speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Despite its futuristic design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a> and advanced features like a long narrow body for streamlined air resistance, delta-shaped wings for lift, a "droop snoot" nose for pilot visibility during takeoff and landing, and special heat-discharging paint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>, the Concorde faced a significant challenge: the sonic boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## Understanding the Sonic Boom

A sonic boom occurs when an aircraft flies faster than the speed of sound, or Mach 1, which is approximately 767 mph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. As a plane pushes through the air, it creates pressure waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. When the plane exceeds the speed of sound, air molecules cannot move out of the way fast enough, causing them to compress and form shockwaves at the front and back of the aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. When these pressure waves reach human ears, they are perceived as a loud, distinctive "double bang" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

Unlike a common misconception, a sonic boom does not just occur once when the plane hits supersonic speed; it continuously "booms" along the entire flight path of the aircraft, carpeting the ground below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. However, passengers inside the plane do not hear the boom at all, as they are traveling at the same speed as the pressure waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. The Concorde's sonic boom was quite loud, comparable to a balloon pop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### Consequences of Sonic Booms

Due to the loud nature of sonic booms, the FAA banned commercial [[technological_advancements_in_supersonic_travel | supersonic flight]] over the United States in 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Similar regulations were adopted worldwide, severely limiting commercial [[technological_advancements_in_supersonic_travel | supersonic flight]] routes primarily to over-ocean travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. This, combined with high fuel consumption and rising fuel costs, and a fatal crash in 2000, led to a decline in public perception and eventually the retirement of the Concorde fleet by 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

## NASA's Solution: The [[nasas_x59_supersonic_plane_and_its_innovations | X-59 Quiet Supersonic Technology (QueSST)]]

Twenty years after the Concorde's last flight, NASA is attempting to bring back commercial [[technological_advancements_in_supersonic_travel | supersonic flight]] by addressing the sonic boom problem with its experimental [[nasas_x59_supersonic_plane_and_its_innovations | X-59]] plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The [[nasas_x59_supersonic_plane_and_its_innovations | X-59]], built by Lockheed Martin, is a single-seater jet designed to travel at 925 mph (1.4 times the speed of sound) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a> and is specifically engineered to prove that [[technological_advancements_in_supersonic_travel | supersonic planes]] can be quiet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

The primary goal of the [[nasas_x59_supersonic_plane_and_its_innovations | X-59]] project is to gather data that could lead to changing existing regulations, allowing [[technological_advancements_in_supersonic_travel | supersonic flight]] over land if the sound level is sufficiently low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

### Design Features for Boom Reduction

The [[nasas_x59_supersonic_plane_and_its_innovations | X-59]] incorporates design features found on the Concorde, such as large delta wings and a streamlined body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. However, it significantly modifies others to reduce the sonic boom:

*   **Long Nose**: The [[nasas_x59_supersonic_plane_and_its_innovations | X-59]] features an exceptionally long, 38-foot carbon fiber nose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Unlike the Concorde's droop snoot, this nose does not move, requiring the pilot to rely on a camera system for forward visibility during takeoff and landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This elongated nose is crucial for breaking up and softening the initial pressure wave, akin to minimizing the splash of a cannonball in a pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Smooth Bottom**: The underside of the [[nasas_x59_supersonic_plane_and_its_innovations | X-59]] is designed to be very smooth and clean, directing any potential shockwaves upwards and away from the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **T-Tail**: The [[nasas_x59_supersonic_plane_and_its_innovations | X-59]] uses a T-tail configuration at the rear, which creates its own shockwave that interacts with and cancels out some of the pressure wave generated at the back of the airplane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **Anti-Static Paint**: The plane also utilizes a special anti-static paint to prevent the buildup of static electricity as it moves through the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

The goal is to achieve a sonic boom as quiet as 75 perceived level decibels (PLdB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, which would sound "kind of like your neighbor closing their car door in front of their house" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>, or most of the time, not even be heard at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

## [[future_of_supersonic_commercial_flight | Future of Supersonic Commercial Flight]]

The [[nasas_x59_supersonic_plane_and_its_innovations | X-59]] is a one-off experimental aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>, not a passenger plane. Its success in demonstrating quiet [[technological_advancements_in_supersonic_travel | supersonic flight]] is intended to pave the way for commercial passenger [[technological_advancements_in_supersonic_travel | supersonic planes]] that can carry more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

The industry is confident in the [[future of supersonic commercial flight | future of supersonic commercial flight]], with companies like Boom aiming to bring their planes to market by the end of the current decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>, and three airlines have already placed orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. However, the regulatory process and testing of the [[nasas_x59_supersonic_plane and its innovations | X-59]] are expected to take several years, indicating that the return of passenger [[technological_advancements_in_supersonic_travel | supersonic flight]] is likely still at least a decade away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. Beyond reducing the sonic boom, new [[technological_advancements_in_supersonic_travel | supersonic planes]] will also need to be more sustainable, less fuel-guzzling, and more affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

[[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | Fracking]] is a process primarily known for extracting oil and natural gas from the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. In the mid-2000s, American politicians were focused on ending dependence on foreign oil, leading to the perfection of technologies to drill into hard rock and pump fluid at high pressure to crack it open, allowing trapped oil and natural gas to escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This process, nicknamed "fracking," significantly increased U.S. oil and natural gas production, making the US the top crude oil producer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. However, this enabled the burning of much more fossil fuels, contributing to [[environmental_concerns_of_fracking | climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Environmental Concerns of Traditional Fracking

[[environmental_concerns_of_fracking | Fracking]] for oil and gas has drawn significant criticism due to its environmental impacts:
*   **Water Pollution**: The EPA has linked the method to groundwater pollution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The fluid used contains chemicals that are effective for extraction but harmful to people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Reports indicate that surface accidents and issues with leftover fluids can pollute drinking water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Earthquakes**: Fracking may cause an increase in earthquakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The primary concern is not the cracking of rock itself, but the disposal of leftover wastewater by injecting it back into the ground, which can cause seismic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Geothermal Energy: A Clean Alternative

Despite the environmental concerns associated with fracking for fossil fuels, the same underlying technology is being explored for a cleaner, more sustainable energy source: [[geothermal_energy_as_a_renewable_resource | geothermal energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

The Earth contains an almost limitless renewable source of heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Estimates suggest that just 0.1% of the Earth's heat content could supply humanity’s total energy needs for 2 million years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### Traditional Geothermal Limitations
Historically, harnessing [[geothermal_energy_as_a_renewable_resource | geothermal energy]] has involved tapping into naturally occurring hot springs or reservoirs of hot water and steam, often concentrated in specific geographical areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This conventional method involves drilling down, finding hot steam, and channeling it through a turbine to generate electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. The limitation is the need to find natural reservoirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS)

**Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS)** propose a solution to overcome the limitations of traditional geothermal energy by artificially creating reservoirs where they don't naturally exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

The conceptual process for EGS is remarkably similar to [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]]:
1.  Drill down into hot rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
2.  Inject water at high pressure to crack the rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
3.  Allow the water to pass through the fractures, heating up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
4.  Collect the heated water and use it to spin a turbine, generating electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

Professor Mukul Sharma, known as the "Frack King" for his expertise in making hydraulic fracturing more efficient for oil and gas companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, is now applying his knowledge to [[geothermal_energy_as_a_renewable_resource | enhanced geothermal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. He believes this technology will enable geothermal to become more commercially viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

### Addressing Environmental Concerns in EGS

The key difference between fracking for fossil fuels and fracking for geothermal lies in the environmental impact:
*   **Fluid Composition**: For EGS, the injected fluid is primarily water, or close to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. This means the environmentally harmful chemicals used in fossil fuel fracking are largely absent, making the fluids "environmentally benign" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Therefore, the main objection to [[environmental_concerns_of_fracking | fracking]] regarding fluid composition does not apply to geothermal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   **Earthquake Risk**: While the concern about seismic activity does exist, the risk is considered much lower with modern science and practices in EGS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Experts believe it can be done safely with proper precautions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## Future Outlook

[[geothermal_energy_as_a_renewable_resource | Geothermal energy]] currently contributes a tiny fraction to global electricity generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. While other renewable sources like wind and solar are expected to grow as fossil fuel use declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, geothermal offers a crucial advantage: reliability. Unlike intermittent sources, geothermal can provide consistent energy, addressing the need for stable power during periods of low wind or cloud cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

While some EGS systems are in development that use a closed-loop approach with no fluid leaving the pipes, limiting the need for fracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, these systems yield less energy because less fluid comes into contact with the hot rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. The "fracking" approach for EGS, by creating more fractures, allows for significantly greater energy extraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

In the pursuit of [[the_potential_of_clean_energy_for_innovation_and_environmental_benefits | clean energy]], utilizing [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]] technology for [[geothermal_energy_as_a_renewable_resource | enhanced geothermal systems]] represents a potential "redemption story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. It signifies an opportunity to repurpose a technology that contributed to [[environmental_concerns_of_fracking | climate change]] towards mitigating its effects and achieving [[future_of_energy_independence_and_renewable_resources | energy independence]] with a clean, virtually limitless resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. The success of EGS depends on its ability to be implemented safely and effectively, underscoring the idea that technology itself is neither inherently good nor bad, but its impact depends on its application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

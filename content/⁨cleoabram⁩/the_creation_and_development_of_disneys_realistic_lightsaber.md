The world's most realistic lightsaber was developed by [[disney_imagineering_and_its_role_in_innovative_technologies | Walt Disney Imagineering]], the department responsible for bringing Disney's ambitious ideas to life [00:00:03]. [[disney_imagineering_and_its_role_in_innovative_technologies | Imagineering]] aims to use technology to create happiness and push the boundaries of what tech can do [00:00:34].

## Development and Purpose

Lanny Smoot, a renowned Imagineer holding over 100 patents, is credited with inventing this "expandable extendable lightsaber" [00:05:10]. The primary challenge in creating the prop was to make it visually consistent with the movies, featuring a flashing light that extends and can cut through objects [00:06:22]. While this real-life version cannot "cut through all sorts of things," the goal was to achieve a smooth extension of the blade [00:06:33].

## How it Works

Unlike conventional lightsaber toys, Disney's version achieves its smooth extension through internal motors [00:06:41].
The mechanism involves:
*   A clear cap [00:06:56]
*   Two long, translucent tapes attached to the cap that unroll from inside the lightsaber [00:06:59].
*   As the tapes extend upward from the hilt, they bend into a concave shape, forming a rigid blade [00:07:04].
*   A series of bright LEDs are integrated into these tapes [00:07:08].
*   These LEDs are programmed to create a realistic lightsaber glow, blinking as the user moves it to simulate motion and strobing to give the effect of flickering "bring power" [00:07:11].

The lightsaber's design is crucial for performers to genuinely embody Jedi Knights [00:06:53].

## Limitations and Use

Despite its realistic appearance, this particular lightsaber is not designed for battle [00:07:32]. For scenes requiring quick movements or combat, a stand-in prop is used [00:07:38]. Its main function is to demonstrate the extension and retraction of the blade [00:07:44].

The overall aim of this and other technologies developed by Disney is not primarily for utility or convenience, but to facilitate [[disneys_use_of_tech_for_storytelling_and_emotional_connection | emotional connection]] and tell stories, ultimately allowing guests to experience joy and feel like a child again [00:15:48].

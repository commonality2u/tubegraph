The legal and [[public_perceptions_of_global_issues | public perceptions of psychedelics]] have undergone significant transformations throughout history, particularly influenced by the "War on Drugs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Early Legality and Medical Interest

In 1955, [[history_and_legal_status_of_psychedelics | psychedelics]] were legal in both the United Kingdom and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. During this period, they were considered an exciting area of medical research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Companies that produced substances like LSD would distribute them to doctors for experimental use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## The Shift to Prohibition

By the 1980s, this permissive stance had drastically changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The United States declared a "War on Drugs," labeling drug abuse as "America's public enemy number one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This declaration led to the banning of [[history_and_legal_status_of_psychedelics | psychedelics]] and a significant shift in research, which became "much darker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. For about 40 years, most [[history_and_legal_status_of_psychedelics | psychedelics]] remained illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Public Opinion and Misinformation

The shift in public perception began in the 1960s as [[history_and_legal_status_of_psychedelics | psychedelics]] moved from controlled laboratory settings into wider public use, associating with the "Summer of Love" and counter-culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. As more people used these drugs, negative headlines emerged, causing public opinion to shift from intrigue to "widespread fear and distrust" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

> "This is the most dangerous drug that has ever come upon the market and it can have tragic if not fatal consequences if they use it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>

The decision to ban [[history_and_legal_status_of_psychedelics | psychedelics]] and halt human research was not scientifically supported but was a "socio-political phenomenon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. These drugs became "associated with the counter-culture" and were "forbidden even for researchers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

Research conducted during this era often supported the government's narrative of [[history_and_legal_status_of_psychedelics | psychedelics]] being extremely dangerous, further solidifying public opinion in favor of the War on Drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. However, it is now known that not all of this research was accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

### The Ecstasy/Meth Study
One notable example of misinformation was a 2002 study published in *Science* by Johns Hopkins researchers, which claimed that a single night of ecstasy use could cause permanent brain damage, with 20% of tested animals dying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Media widely publicized this, stating, "Using ecstasy is like playing Russian roulette with your brain function" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

A year later, the same researchers retracted their study, admitting they had accidentally injected the monkeys with methamphetamine instead of ecstasy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Despite the retraction, the damage to the [[public_perceptions_of_global_issues | public's understanding of psychedelics]] was already done, influencing perceptions for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. This highlights the critical importance of how early scientific and technological findings are framed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## Current Resurgence and Future Outlook

The "deep freeze" on [[therapeutic_potential_and_research_on_psychedelics | psychedelic research]] has only recently begun to thaw, with a significant ramp-up in the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. There is now a growing movement to legalize [[history_and_legal_status_of_psychedelics | psychedelics]] again in the United States, driven by new research suggesting major health benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

Despite the renewed interest and hype around their [[therapeutic_potential_and_research on_psychedelics | potential therapeutic applications]], it is crucial to avoid over-hyping science that is still in progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. The historical experience with the War on Drugs serves as a cautionary tale:

> The story of [[history_and_legal_status_of_psychedelics | psychedelics]] is a classic tale of trying to control something that we don't fully understand, creating a narrative of fear and distrust that drove researchers away, stifling decades of innovation and progress that could have potentially helped millions of people. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>

The current focus is on basing regulation on sound science and moving beyond "unwarranted fear or hype," separating the scientific question of their efficacy from political influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. The aim is to understand how [[history_and_legal_status_of_psychedelics | psychedelics]] might help millions of people struggling with health conditions, rather than being swayed by the [[public_perceptions of_global_issues | tides of public perception]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

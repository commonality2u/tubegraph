Nuclear power has long been a subject of debate, particularly concerning the hazardous byproduct of its energy generation: nuclear waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, a significant yet often overlooked aspect of nuclear technology is the potential for [[nuclear_waste_recycling | nuclear waste recycling]] – transforming what is perceived as dangerous refuse into a valuable [[nuclear_waste_as_energy | clean energy resource]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This article explores the historical context, current challenges, and future prospects of this transformative technology.

## Historical Context: A Forgotten Innovation

As early as 1962, a nuclear reactor was built by Argonne National Laboratory that notably generated electricity from nuclear waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Developers predicted that by the year 2000, over half of the country's electric power would originate from atomic sources, leveraging this recycling technology for an "incredible clean energy future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

Despite these early predictions, the United States today does not reuse any of its nuclear waste, leading to it piling up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The prevailing perception of nuclear waste is that of dangerous, glowing green goo in yellow barrels that requires storage for hundreds of thousands of years due to its radioactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## The Potential of Nuclear Waste as Energy

Research indicates that existing nuclear waste is not merely radioactive trash but an "incredible clean energy resource" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Experts suggest there is enough used nuclear fuel in the US alone to power the country for the next 150 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The technology to achieve this already exists; the main barrier is the lack of commercial facilities for its implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

### How Nuclear Power Works and Creates Waste

Nuclear power plants typically heat liquid into steam to spin a turbine, generating electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This heat is produced by splitting atoms of special rocks, primarily Uranium-235 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Uranium is enriched to increase the concentration of Uranium-235, which can sustain a nuclear chain reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

After four to six years, the fuel becomes "spent" as enough Uranium-235 has broken down, and the reaction loses efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This spent fuel, known as high-level nuclear waste, contains leftover uranium and highly unstable atoms that emit ionizing radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. This waste can remain radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years, posing a significant storage challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Currently, most US nuclear waste is stored in dry casks designed to last decades, not millennia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This approach is termed the "once through" fuel cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

## The [[closed_nuclear_fuel_cycle | Closed Nuclear Fuel Cycle]]: Recycling Nuclear Waste

The concept of recycling nuclear waste involves filtering out still-useful materials from true waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Argonne National Laboratory continues to test [[nuclear_waste_recycling | nuclear waste recycling]] in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. The process involves:
*   Cutting spent nuclear waste into small pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   Dissolving these pieces in molten salts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   Using electricity to separate uranium and other useful materials, which deposit on the other side of the vat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   Creating new fuel rods from these deposits for reuse in a reactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

This process can be repeated multiple times, not only generating more electricity but also dramatically reducing the time the remaining waste remains radioactive – from hundreds of thousands of years down to hundreds of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. This is known as a [[closed_nuclear_fuel_cycle | closed nuclear fuel cycle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Some countries, like Japan, already implement this cycle to reduce reliance on imported fuel, conserve uranium, and mitigate waste radioactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

## Challenges to Implementation

### Policy and Proliferation Concerns

In 1977, President Jimmy Carter implemented new policies that halted all [[nuclear_waste_recycling | nuclear recycling]] in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. This decision was driven by concerns over nuclear proliferation, specifically the separation of plutonium during the recycling process, which was deemed a high-risk material for weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. The US then shifted towards "light water reactors," which are common today, moving away from "fast reactors" capable of handling nuclear waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Although President Reagan lifted the ban in 1981 as the ban was no longer considered helpful for proliferation prevention, companies had already invested in reactors that could not recycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

### Economic Viability

Currently, the main argument against [[nuclear_waste_recycling | nuclear fuel recycling]] is its high cost, rendering it uneconomical compared to the cheap and plentiful supply of new uranium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. This lack of economic incentive has been a significant barrier to its widespread adoption in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

## Future Prospects and Changing Incentives

The incentives for [[nuclear_waste_recycling | recycling nuclear fuel]] are undergoing a shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Concerns over global conflict potentially cutting off fuel supplies and the increasing recognition of the urgent need for more [[challenges_and_solutions_in_increasing_clean_energy_production | clean energy production]] are renewing interest in this previously abandoned technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

The technology for [[nuclear_waste_recycling | nuclear waste recycling]] is not a distant dream; it has been demonstrated and proven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. The challenge now lies in its commercialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. While there are significant complexities to address, the ability to recycle nuclear waste speaks to humanity's capacity to change minds, overcome fears, and utilize resources and ingenuity for a better future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. The potential of nuclear recycling represents a critical step in achieving a sustainable and abundant energy supply for centuries to come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

Despite past skepticism, [[current_state_and_implementation_of_selfdriving_cars | self-driving cars]] are now being deployed, though not always in the "go-anywhere sci-fi version" envisioned previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a>. The deployment of these vehicles presents significant challenges and considerations, particularly regarding human-machine interaction, the scope of operation, and long-term societal impacts.

## Levels of Autonomous Driving

The journey towards full autonomy is a long road with a "messy middle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:03">[02:33:03]</a>. The progression of [[introduction_to_autonomous_vehicles | autonomous vehicles]] is categorized into [[levels_of_autonomous_driving_technology | levels of self-driving-ness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:06">[03:01:06]</a>:
*   **Level 0**: Momentary help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.
*   **Level 1**: More continuous support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.
*   **Level 2**: Newer highway piloting systems, representing the limit of most cars easily bought today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.
    *   At all levels up to Level 2, humans remain "very much in charge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.
*   **Higher Levels (Level 3/4)**: The car would be fully in charge, but only in certain situations or areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. Self-driving taxis currently picking up people are operating at this level, within constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:01">[04:05:01]</a>.
*   **Level 5**: The car is in charge anywhere, any time, even if the passenger is asleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. This ultimate sci-fi level is not yet close to realization, with many predictions seeming "bullshit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

## Current Deployment Challenges and Considerations

The current "interesting fight" in self-driving technology focuses on achieving full self-driving within specific constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. This involves two major divides:

### 1. Where to Use Them

*   **Less Complex Situations, Anywhere (e.g., Highways)**: Training vehicles to drive in areas without too much complexity, like highways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. An example of this is long-distance autonomous trucking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.
*   **More Complex Situations, Geographically Constrained (e.g., Cities)**: Operating in more complex areas where vehicles must be specifically trained and cannot simply be dropped into a new city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. Robotaxis like those from Cruise in San Francisco exemplify this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.

### 2. Whether to Carry People

*   **No People (Delivery Robots/Trucking)**: This category includes delivery robots in cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a> and long-distance autonomous trucking on highways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. Autonomous trucks offer efficiency benefits as they "don't sleep, they don't drink, they don't get distracted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:13">[09:14:13]</a>.
*   **Carrying People (Robotaxis)**: These vehicles, like those from Cruise, are designed to pick up passengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### Human-Machine Interaction and Unexpected Scenarios

Deploying self-driving cars in the real world reveals "weird nuances between humans and machines that we take for granted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.

*   **Passengers Falling Asleep**: Some passengers fall asleep after using the service, leading to situations where the car waits for them to wake up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. Customer support must intervene by detecting if people don't exit quickly and communicate via audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>.
*   **Police Interactions**: A viral incident involved a driverless car pulling over for police, then driving away. The car's complex system detected sirens and lights perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. The "awkward" part was the police officer interacting with customer support, and when the officer walked away and turned off sirens, the vehicle assumed it was safe to proceed to a truly safe pull-over spot across the intersection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>. This highlights the complexity of navigating human expectations with programmed behavior.

### Future Design and Control

Future robotaxis like Cruise's "Origin" are designed without a steering wheel or brake pedals, removing elements "meant for the driver, that is just kind of silly to keep around if there is no driver" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>. A key consideration is that a driver "couldn't take over one of those cars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>. The CEO of Cruise notes that even current vehicles cannot be taken control of by passengers, because interference would likely make the situation worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>.

## Societal and [[the_future_impact_of_selfdriving_technology_on_society_and_transportation | Future Impact of Self-Driving Technology]]

The deployment of self-driving vehicles brings significant [[potential_risks_and_benefits_of_ai | potential risks and benefits of AI]] and societal changes:

*   **Reduced Risk**: The status quo of human driving involves significant risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>. In the future, people may view human driving as "barbaric," especially allowing teenagers to drive "huge death machines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>.
*   **Time Savings**: Self-driving technology has the potential to give people back significant amounts of time, such as an hour or more from their daily commutes, which could be "profound" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.
*   **Reshaping Goods Movement**: Autonomous trucking could reshape how goods are moved globally, fundamentally altering supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>.

The development of self-driving cars highlights that the future is not solely defined by a distant "sci-fi version" but by the "messy, messy middle" of current implementation and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>.

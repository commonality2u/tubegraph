The dramatic increase in the value of digital art, often selling for millions of dollars, prompts a fundamental question: How can something seemingly so easily replicable be so valuable? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a> To understand this, it's necessary to examine the peculiar ways in which art has come to be valued, particularly the role of celebrity. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>

## The 1973 Sotheby's Auction: A Turning Point

The story of modern art valuation, and the influence of celebrity, began not with digital art, but with a pivotal auction in New York City on October 18, 1973. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a> Hosted by collectors Robert and Ethel Scull, this event changed the art world forever. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a> The Sculls were among the first to passionately and extensively collect works by living artists such as Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, and Jasper Johns. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>

This auction marked the first time that works by living artists sold for "many tens of millions of dollars." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a> This phenomenon generated significant backlash, with many viewing it as an unseemly "marriage between art and money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>—criticisms strikingly similar to those leveled against [[understanding_nfts_and_their_value | NFTs]] today. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>

A notable incident involved Robert Rauschenberg, who got into a "fistfight in the middle of the auction" because he couldn't comprehend the price at which his own work was trading. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a> Rauschenberg had originally sold the piece for $900, only to see it re-sell for $85,000, with him receiving none of the profit. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> This event, described as "the moment that changed everything" by David Galperin, Head of Contemporary Art for the Americas at Sotheby’s, fundamentally altered the art market. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>

## The Rise of the Artist as Celebrity

The 1973 auction solidified a new paradigm where "living artists became celebrities." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a> Andy Warhol was a key figure in this transformation; "celebrity was his medium." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> By the time of the auction, Warhol himself had become as famous, if not more famous, than the celebrities he depicted in his artworks. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>

This shift meant that the value of art increasingly hinged on the artist's personal celebrity or the conceptual ideas behind the art, rather than on the physical object itself. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a> This untethered value from traditional benchmarks such as production cost, creation time, or even aesthetic desire for a physical piece. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a> Instead, the question became: "How much is that idea worth?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>

The consequence has been a continuous upward trend in art prices, with "the market entirely exploded." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a> This explosion in prices was accompanied by an expansion of what "art IS," encompassing concepts like text phrases, piles of candy, a banana taped to a wall, or even instructions for making the art itself. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>

> "I think it would be great if more people took up silk screens so that no one would know whether my picture was mine or someone else's." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>
> — Andy Warhol

Warhol's statement reflects a deliberate engagement with notions of originality and authorship, further exemplified by appropriation artists like Elaine Sturtevant, who copied Warhol's works using his own silkscreens. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a> This highlights how the understanding and appreciation of art became deeply intertwined with concepts, branding, hype, ego, speculation, and investment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>

## Art as Concept vs. Physical Object

This evolution in [[art_valuation_and_historical_context | art valuation]] reveals that value is an "incredibly flexible idea." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a> For many, ownership means having the "certificate" or proof of purchase, which grants the artwork its value, rather than the physical piece itself. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a> This concept is evident in historical art and directly applicable to [[understanding_nfts_and_their_value | NFTs]], where the underlying technology (blockchain) serves as the agreed-upon database of ownership. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>

The questions critics raise about NFTs—"Why do NFTs have any value?" or "I can just screenshot that"—are not new. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a> They echo the same questions the art world has grappled with for decades: "What is value? Where does it come from? What is too much, for too little?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>

NFTs have brought these questions into sharper public focus by pushing the boundaries further: "What about more money? And no physical product? And anyone decides?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a> While uncomfortable for some, NFTs are part of the larger context of art itself, revealing how society assigns value, even to things that lack traditional physical presence or obvious utility. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a> The rise of celebrity culture in art has shaped this perception, preparing the ground for purely conceptual and digitally-native art forms. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>

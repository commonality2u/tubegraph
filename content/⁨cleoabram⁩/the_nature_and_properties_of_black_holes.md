Black holes are regions of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:01">[07:49:01]</a>. The concept of black holes emerged theoretically shortly after [[Einsteins theory of relativity and black holes | Einstein's theory of gravity]] was published in 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

## Theoretical Foundations

[[Einsteins theory of relativity and black holes | Einstein's theory of relativity]] describes how spacetime, often called the fabric of the universe, warps or curves in response to matter and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. The force of gravity, in this theory, is the response of objects to this distortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. As physicist John Wheeler put it, "Matter tells spacetime how to curve and spacetime tells matter how to move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

In 1916, Karl Schwarzschild found a solution to Einstein's equations for a spherical, non-spinning mass that inherently described a black hole, although it wasn't recognized as such at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

## Formation of Black Holes

A star is a balancing act between its own gravity, which causes collapse, and the outward pressure from nuclear fusion reactions in its core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. When a star runs out of nuclear fuel, fusion reactions cease, and it resumes collapsing under its own gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

For most stars, this collapse is halted by other forces:
*   **White Dwarfs**: Stars less than 1.4 times the mass of the Sun (the Chandrasekhar limit) are stopped from collapsing by the force of electrons resisting being too close together, due to the Pauli exclusion principle and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>.
*   **Neutron Stars**: More massive stars can collapse further, with the collapse halted by the jiggling of neutrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>.

However, if a star is massive enough (roughly three times the mass of the Sun or more), nothing can stop its collapse, leading to the formation of a black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:00">[17:02:00]</a>. The lightest known black holes are around this mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:06:00">[17:06:06]</a>.

## Key Properties

### Schwarzschild Radius
The Schwarzschild radius is the theoretical radius to which any mass would need to be compressed to become a black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>. For the Sun, this radius is 3 kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:21]</a>. For Earth, it's about 0.8 centimeters, roughly the size of a pea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>.

### Event Horizon
The event horizon is the boundary around a black hole beyond which the escape velocity exceeds the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. Light rays emitted from the surface would be trapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.

*   **River Model**: One way to visualize the event horizon is through the "river model," where space itself flows inwards towards the black hole like a river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. At the horizon, the river of space flows inwards at the speed of light, and faster than light inside, making escape impossible, akin to a fish trying to swim upstream against an overwhelming current <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:42]</a>.

### Singularity
Beyond the event horizon, all paths lead towards a central point called the singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:01]</a>. It's often pictured as an infinitely dense point, but in [[Einsteins theory of relativity and black holes | Einstein's theory]], it's more accurately described not as a place in space, but as a moment in time—the end of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>. Inside the black hole, space and time effectively flip roles, making movement towards the singularity as inevitable as moving towards tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>.

### The Process of Falling into a Black Hole
For an observer falling into a very large supermassive black hole, [[The Process of Falling into a Black Hole | nothing would feel unusual]] upon crossing the event horizon according to [[Einsteins theory of relativity and black holes | Einstein's theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:47:00">[18:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:53:00">[18:53:00]</a>. This is due to Einstein's equivalence principle, which states that freefall is indistinguishable from being in flat space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:06:00">[18:06:00]</a>.

However, for a smaller black hole, tidal forces would become significant before reaching the horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:05:00">[20:05:00]</a>. These "tidal forces" cause an object to be stretched in one direction and squashed in others, a phenomenon known as **spaghettification** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:11:00">[20:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:15:00">[25:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:25:00">[26:25:00]</a>. As one gets closer to the singularity, these tidal forces become infinitely extreme, ripping apart atoms, protons, and even quarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:37:00">[26:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:47:00">[26:47:00]</a>.

From the perspective of an *outside* observer, time would appear to tick more slowly for someone approaching a black hole, eventually seeming to stop at the event horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:08:00">[22:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:31:00">[22:31:00]</a>. The light emitted by the infalling object would also become increasingly redshifted, eventually fading to nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:53:00">[22:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:04:00">[23:04:00]</a>. Therefore, from an external viewpoint, nothing ever truly *enters* the black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:38:00">[22:38:00]</a>.

## Observational Evidence

The first theoretical glimpse of black holes came in 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. The Event Horizon Telescope captured the first image of a black hole in the galaxy M87, and later, of Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of our own Milky Way galaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>.

These images depict the [[how_black_holes_warp_space_and_time | distortion of light]] from the surrounding accretion disc, a violently orbiting flat, thin disc of material that heats up and emits light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:07]</a>. The observed "donut shape" is a characteristic prediction of [[Einsteins theory of relativity and black holes | Einstein's theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>. Sagittarius A* is about 6 million times the mass of the Sun, while the one in M87 is 6 billion times the mass of the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>.

## [[Recent Discoveries and Theories in Black Hole Physics | Recent Discoveries and Theories]]

### [[Hawking radiation and information paradox | Hawking Radiation and the Information Paradox]]
Classically, nothing can escape a black hole once it crosses the event horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:14:00">[31:14:00]</a>. However, in the 1970s, Stephen Hawking discovered that black holes are not truly "black" and emit a phenomenon known as [[Hawking radiation and information paradox | Hawking radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:42:00">[31:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:41:00">[32:41:00]</a>. This radiation arises from the disruption of the quantum vacuum near the event horizon, where particles spontaneously appear and one falls in while its partner escapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:21:00">[32:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:08:00">[33:08:00]</a>.

Initially, Hawking's calculations suggested that [[Hawking radiation and information paradox | Hawking radiation]] was "informationless" or purely thermal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:55:00">[35:55:00]</a>. This implied that any information about matter falling into the black hole would be erased once the black hole evaporated, violating the fundamental law that information is conserved in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:32:00">[35:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:44:00">[36:44:00]</a>. This became known as the [[Theories on Black Hole Information Paradox | black hole information paradox]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:50:00">[35:50:00]</a>.

In 2019, research by Jeff Pennington and others suggested that Hawking's initial calculation missed subtle details, and that the [[Hawking radiation and information paradox | radiation]] *does* carry information about what fell into the black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:13:00">[38:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:35:00">[38:35:00]</a>.

### [[The holographic principle and its implications | The Holographic Principle]] and Dual Descriptions
The resolution of the [[Theories on Black Hole Information Paradox | information paradox]] points towards [[The holographic principle and its implications | the holographic principle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:49:00">[40:49:00]</a>. Key ideas include:
*   **Black Hole Entropy**: Jacob Bekenstein calculated the entropy of a black hole, which is related to its hidden information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:08:00">[42:08:00]</a>. Remarkably, this entropy is proportional to the *surface area* of the event horizon, not its volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:13:00">[42:13:00]</a>. This implies that information about the black hole's interior might be encoded on its 2D surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:45:00">[42:45:00]</a>, contrary to our intuition that information scales with volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:01:00">[43:01:00]</a>. This suggests that "there is no interior to this thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:22:00">[43:22:00]</a>.

*   **Black Hole Complementarity**: The modern view, debated but widely considered, is that both perspectives of infalling matter (incineration for an outside observer, spaghettification for the infalling observer) are correct from different points of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:54:00">[45:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:09:00">[46:09:00]</a>. This leads to the idea that the black hole's interior might, in some sense, be the same place as its exterior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:12:00">[48:12:00]</a>.

*   **ER=EPR**: This conjecture, proposed by Leonard Susskind and others, posits that Einstein-Rosen (ER) bridges (wormholes) are equivalent to Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) quantum entanglement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:48:00">[48:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:02:00">[49:02:00]</a>. This suggests that quantum entanglement can be pictured as a wormhole linking two things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:48:00">[50:48:00]</a>. In the context of black holes, this could mean that information from the interior might escape through such connections, resolving the paradox without violating the no-cloning theorem of quantum mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:33:00">[47:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:18:00">[48:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:26:00">[48:26:00]</a>.

## Black Holes and the Fabric of Reality

The study of black holes provides a window into the underlying structure of space and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:24:00">[55:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:01:00">[56:01:00]</a>. The prevailing idea is that geometry and spacetime might "emerge" from a more fundamental description of the universe, possibly a network of quantum bits (qubits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:06:00">[56:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:12:00">[56:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:25:00">[56:25:00]</a>. This aligns with John Wheeler's "it from bit" idea, where fundamental reality is information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:31:00">[56:31:00]</a>.

### Comparison to the [[The mystery of singularities and the beginning of the universe | Big Bang Singularity]]
The singularity inside a black hole is the "end of time" in [[Einsteins theory of relativity and black holes | Einstein's theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:42:00">[33:42:00]</a>, while the [[The mystery of singularities and the beginning of the universe | Big Bang singularity]] is often considered the "beginning of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>. While both are singularities, they are fundamentally different: black holes are highly scrambled, high-entropy states, whereas the early universe (Big Bang) was a very low-entropy state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>. Despite their differences, understanding one may be related to understanding the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:34">[01:04:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:16">[01:05:16]</a>.

### Implications for Quantum Computing
The techniques developed to understand black holes and emergent spacetime are directly relevant to understanding and building quantum computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:05:00">[58:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:17:00">[58:17:00]</a>. This connection highlights how fundamental research into seemingly abstract phenomena can lead to practical technological insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:48:00">[58:48:00]</a>.

The "firewall paradox" is an unresolved issue that challenges the equivalence principle at the event horizon, suggesting that perhaps there is no interior to a black hole, and matter might be incinerated before crossing the horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>. This ongoing debate further emphasizes that the nature of spacetime itself is still being uncovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:44">[01:01:44]</a>.

Ultimately, the study of black holes is a cutting edge of research that helps unlock much deeper questions about the universe as a whole, acting as a "Rosetta stone" to translate between different pictures of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>.

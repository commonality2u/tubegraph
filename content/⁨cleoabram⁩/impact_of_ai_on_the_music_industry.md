Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the music industry, enabling new forms of creation, collaboration, and raising complex questions about compensation and copyright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This [[ai_in_music_creation | AI music]] revolution includes AI voice clones, the generation of lyrics and melodies, and entirely new songs made by simply typing in a few words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. While some express concern that AI could be the [[challenges_and_concerns_of_ai_replacing_artists | death of music]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, others see an opportunity to profoundly change how humans express themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## What AI Music Can Do

[[ai_in_music_creation | AI music]] capabilities extend beyond simple voice cloning, like Frank Sinatra singing "Get Low" or Johnny Cash singing "Barbie Girl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. AI allows for:
*   **Completely new songs** as "fake collaborations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Generating lyrics or melodies** in seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Transforming voices** into that of another artist, as demonstrated by Grimes's Elf Tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Creating music from text prompts** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Bridging "The Gap" in Creativity

One potential benefit of AI in music is its ability to "shrink the gap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This "gap" refers to the difference between a perfect idea in one's head and what can realistically be created with available tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. [[impact_of_ai_on_human_creativity | Creativity]] is distinct from technical skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, and by lowering the technical skill required for expression, AI can potentially lead to more great music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Historically, musical geniuses like Mozart or Beethoven faced high costs to test ideas, while modern artists like Avicii used computers as their tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. AI is seen as a new, powerful [[future_of_ai_as_a_tool_for_artists | tool]] in this evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

Tools like ChatGPT can generate lyrics, and Google's MusicLM can create new melodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:50]</a>. It's possible that [[ai_in_music_creation | AI-generated music]] is already present on platforms like Spotify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

### Artist Perspectives on AI Tools

Artists hold differing views on the use of AI. Some, like Grimes, embrace controversial uses such as voice cloning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Grimes allows anyone to change their voice into hers using her Elf Tech tool, even creating a separate verified artist profile on Spotify for collaborators using her voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. She plans to release a competitive AI album alongside her human-made album <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

However, other artists are not comfortable with unauthorized use of their voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. The CEO of Spotify notes that they receive audio files and wouldn't necessarily know what tools were used to create them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## Compensation and Copyright in the Age of AI

The central question arising from [[ai_in_music_creation | AI music]] is: [[copyright_issues_with_aigenerated_music | When should artists get paid in a world with AI music?]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a> The existing music industry has rules differentiating "inspiration" from "copying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

*   **Inspiration:** Most music falls into this category, where artists are influenced by others without paying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Direct Copying with Payment:** This is common and acceptable through:
    *   **Sampling:** Using parts of an original recording, requiring payment for composition and original recording (e.g., Doja Cat's "Walk On By") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
    *   **Interpolation:** Re-recording a melody or line from another song, requiring payment to the original composer but not for the recording (e.g., Ariana Grande's use of "My Favorite Things") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
    *   **Covering:** Re-recording an entire song, requiring payment to the original composition owner (e.g., Miley Cyrus covering "Jolene") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

In all these cases, if [[ai_in_music_creation | AI]] is used to perform these actions, artists still need to pay the original owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. [[copyright_issues_with_aigenerated_music | Copyright]] protects the original song recording (master) and the composition itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. Legal battles over copyright are frequent, as seen in cases like "Blurred Lines" versus "Got to Give It Up" or Ed Sheeran's lawsuit over chord progressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### The Challenge of AI Training Data

A unique challenge posed by [[ai_in_music_creation | AI music]] is whether artists should be paid if an AI trains on their music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. [[ai_in_music_creation | AI tools]] require thousands of songs for training data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. These AIs analyze patterns and create entirely new works, rather than collaging pieces from their data sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

Currently, the industry decides on payment based on the *output* of the music, not the *input* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. If the end result sounds similar enough to an existing artist, they are paid, regardless of whether their music was explicitly used in the creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Changing this would mean paying artists for "inspiration," a concept not yet established in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. The Spotify CEO believes the focus should be on the output, ensuring it's "really new IP" and not "confusingly similar" to existing artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

## AI as an Artist?

The discussion becomes more complex if AI begins to make music more autonomously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. If AI agents generate millions or billions of songs, it raises questions about [[copyright_issues_with_aigenerated_music | IP ownership]] and whether an AI can be considered a "creator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. While the AI itself might not be treated as a creator, the person behind the AI likely would be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

Ultimately, while the emotional impact of music might remain regardless of its creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>, music is deeply tied to human expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. The challenge is to figure out how to ensure musicians are fairly compensated while allowing [[future_of_ai_as_a_tool_for_artists | AI to be a tool]] that helps foster more human connections and enables more people to realize their musical talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

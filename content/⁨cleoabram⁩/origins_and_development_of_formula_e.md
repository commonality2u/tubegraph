[[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] has long been known as a sport showcasing cutting-edge car technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. However, with the global shift towards [[transition_to_electric_cars_in_racing | fully electric cars]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, a challenge emerged: if the underlying technology of [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | F1]] cars became outdated, it would lose its relevance, investment, and purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This became particularly evident as governments worldwide began discussing and implementing bans on new gas car sales, such as California's ban and the European Union's plan by 2040 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This created an "existential moment" for a sport meant to advertise the future of cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Formula E emerged as a direct response to this dilemma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## The Genesis of Formula E

The concept for Formula E originated at a dinner in Paris 11 years prior to the events of the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Key figures at this dinner included:
*   **Alejandro Agag**: A Spanish businessman and former member of the European Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Antonio Tajani**: Former European Commissioner for Transport, responsible for transportation regulation across the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Jean Todt**: President of the FIA, the governing body overseeing [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

During this dinner, Antonio Tajani emphasized that the European Commission would strongly push for electrification, viewing electric as the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### The Innovator's Dilemma

Despite the clear direction, [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] could not simply switch to electric cars for several reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>:
*   **Technological Limitations**: 11 years prior, electric car batteries could not sustain a [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] race's required distance of at least 305 kilometers (190 miles) in under two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Changing this would necessitate changing the sport itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Fan Resistance**: Millions of avid [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | F1]] fans might react negatively to such a drastic change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Manufacturer Reluctance**: In 2011, most of [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | F1]]'s marquee car companies did not even produce electric cars and therefore did not want the sport to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

This situation represented a classic innovator's dilemma, where the incumbent (Formula 1) could not risk threatening its existing successful model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### Birth of a New Championship and Exclusive License

Recognizing this, Jean Todt suggested that the FIA create a new, separate electric championship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Thus, Formula E was conceived as a "space program for electric cars," designed to rapidly advance [[Technological innovations in Formula E | technology]] for both racing and future road cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

A crucial aspect of its creation was an exclusive license granted for 25 years, starting with Formula E's official launch in 2014, ensuring only this new championship could be fully electric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This license is set to expire in 2039, four years after the EU and California's bans on new gas car sales take effect in 2035 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Designing a Spectacle: Entertainment and Accessibility

The goal for Formula E was to build an electric car "space program" by making the most entertaining sport possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The creators brainstormed ideas, often looking at racing like a video game, specifically drawing inspiration from "Super Mario Kart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

Formula E maintained the basic structure of [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]], with teams having two drivers earning points based on their finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. However, they introduced several innovations to enhance excitement and fan engagement:

*   **City Center Races**: Unlike [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | F1]] which often races on purpose-built tracks, Formula E opted for street racing in city centers like Mexico City, London, Seoul, New York City, Hong Kong, and Berlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This brings the show closer to the people and conveys the message that electric cars are a solution for urban mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Races are designed to be easily accessible and fan-friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Attack Mode**: Inspired by video game boosts, drivers can temporarily gain more energy by going off the racing line in a designated "Attack Mode" zone, providing a strategic advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Fan Boost**: A unique feature where the audience could vote to give a specific driver more speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. While this rule was retired in 2023, it exemplifies Formula E's flexibility in adopting "fun ideas" that might be considered "gimmicks" in [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

## [[Technological innovations in Formula E | Technological Innovations]] and Car Development

Formula E serves as a real-life "video game" and a laboratory for improving [[transition_to_electric_cars_in_racing | electric cars]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. The evolution of its race cars directly reflects the advancements in consumer electric vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

*   **Gen 1 (First Formula E car)**: These initial cars faced a significant challenge: batteries didn't last long enough due to limited range (around 250 miles maximum per charge, much less in race conditions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. The solution was to provide each driver with two cars, requiring mid-race car swaps during pit stops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Gen 2**: After four years of racing Gen 1 cars, the Gen 2 was introduced, capable of doing twice the distance and completing an entire race with only one car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Gen 3**: The fastest and most powerful electric race car ever built, the Gen 3 represents a significant step forward in [[Technological innovations in Formula E | technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
    *   **Specifications**: Power increased from 250 kilowatts to 350 kilowatts, and weight decreased from over 900 kilograms to approximately 850 kilograms, resulting in faster cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
    *   **Component Strategy**: Unlike [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]], all Formula E teams use the same frame, battery, and most ancillary parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Teams focus their development and spending on powertrain components that convert battery energy into speed, such as the rear motor, inverter, gearbox, and associated software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. This deliberate design aims to control costs and direct [[Technological innovations in Formula E | innovation]] where it matters most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

### Innovative Braking System: Regenerative Brakes

A major [[Technological innovations in Formula E | technological innovation]] in the Gen 3 car is the absence of rear mechanical brakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Instead, the cars are stopped by the electric motors themselves, converting kinetic energy into electrical energy to recharge the batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. This regenerative braking system can recuperate up to 80% of the energy back into the battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. This technology, while challenging and leading to "scare moments" during testing, is being pushed forward with the expectation that it will be incorporated into future road vehicles, leading to more miles, faster driving, cleaner operation, and quicker charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

## The Future of Racing

While Formula E was launching, [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] announced a massive change, going "hybrid" with turbo engines and two electric motors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. However, due to Formula E's exclusive license for *purely* electric racing, [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | F1]] cannot become fully electric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Even with their next generation of engines moving towards a 50/50 electric-fuel split, they are constrained by this agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

Formula E sees itself as a crucial "science project" that must bring racing into the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. As combustion cars face increasing illegality, Formula E ensures that the sport remains relevant to the technology being sold to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. The ongoing "fight for the future of cars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a> between Formula E and [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] continues to drive [[innovation_and_future_directions_in_formula_1 | better technology]] for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

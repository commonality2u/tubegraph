A common [[misconceptions_about_clean_energy | misconception about energy]] suggests that slowing climate change necessitates using less energy indefinitely, leading to a "smaller, less comfortable life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. However, this perspective is considered "backward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The actual goal is to achieve "vastly more energy" that is entirely clean, enabling more people to live better lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## The Fossil Fuel Trap and its Limitations

Currently, most of the world's energy comes from fossil fuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, placing society in a "trap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. When energy relies heavily on fossil fuels, using less is the only viable option to slow climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. Historically, the [[the_role_of_innovation_and_technology_in_clean_energy | technologies]] to replace fossil fuels were not available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. This led to a "stick" approach in policy and science, emphasizing that "terrible things will happen" if less energy isn't used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. This message, combined with efficiency improvements and policy changes, did slow the increase in energy use in some developed countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. For many, the understanding was "energy equals fossil fuels, fossil fuels equal energy, fossil fuels are bad, energy is bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

Conservation alone is insufficient for environmental goals; a "net zero economy" requires zero-carbon energy sources, at which point the need to conserve diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

## A Shift in Ambition: Towards Abundant Clean Energy

The current approach to energy is likened to an "energy diet," which should be ended by wildly increasing [[the_role_of_innovation_and_technology_in_clean_energy | clean energy]] ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. The potential of [[transitioning_from_fossil_fuels_to_clean_energy | clean energy]] is compelling, and steps should be taken to "unleash" it, painting a picture of how lives will improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. This shift in thinking is crucial because how we conceptualize energy use shapes future accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

Instead of focusing solely on avoiding catastrophe, there is a need for a vision of what "could go right if we succeed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. This "carrot" of [[transitioning_from_fossil_fuels_to_clean_energy | clean energy]] provides a powerful motivation for hope and work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

## Solutions: Enabling a Better Future with More Clean Energy

The increase in energy use throughout history, while currently problematic in the context of climate change, has fundamentally improved human life by enabling technologies like electricity, flushing toilets, and refrigerators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.

### Improving Global Quality of Life
The primary goal is to extend the quality of life enjoyed by most people in rich countries to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. This realistically cannot be achieved without using more energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. However, this increased energy use cannot come from fossil fuels without accelerating climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.

This presents a significant global challenge, as richer countries, having used fossil fuels to establish their high standards of living, are now telling poorer countries they cannot follow the same path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>. Taking current energy use as a ceiling and advocating for conservation is not a viable solution for developing nations like Vietnam, Ethiopia, or Nicaragua, nor is it a solution they will accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. The sooner more zero-carbon energy sources become available, the sooner this conflict becomes irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.

### Unlocking Future Innovations
Abundant [[transitioning_from_fossil_fuels_to_clean_energy | clean energy]] would enable the widespread commercialization of many energy-intensive [[the_role_of_innovation_and_technology_in_clean_energy | technologies]] that are currently too expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>:

*   **Direct air capture of carbon dioxide** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.
*   **Zero-carbon hydrogen production**, which could solve many problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.
*   **Vertical farms** that could feed entire cities locally, using drastically less water and producing more crops with less pollution, despite needing much more energy than traditional agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>.
*   **Desalination of saltwater** to make it drinkable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>.

These tools are functional "science projects" but are not commercially viable due to high energy costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>. If more energy can be produced from clean sources, these solutions become feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.

## Conclusion: The Audacity of Ambition
Human history is characterized by finding ways to use more energy to improve life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. The ambition required to achieve a future with abundant [[transitioning_from_fossil_fuels_to_clean_energy | clean energy]] is immense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>. The ultimate goal is not less energy, but more energy, achieved responsibly by transitioning to clean sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.

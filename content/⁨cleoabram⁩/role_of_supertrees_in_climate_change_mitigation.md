Genetically engineered "supertrees" are emerging as a potential tool in the fight against climate change. These trees are designed to capture more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than their natural counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## The Need for New Solutions
Over the past few decades, [[Genetic engineering for enhanced carbon capture in trees | genetic engineering]] has provided the ability to manipulate living organisms, including crops, animals, and even humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Simultaneously, humanity faces a man-made environmental disaster characterized by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions, leading to a warming planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Researchers are now exploring how [[Genetic engineering for enhanced carbon capture in trees | genetic engineering]] can contribute to slowing climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

It is important to note that while supertrees offer a potential solution, their effectiveness is limited if greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Mass tree planting efforts alone also have limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. However, these innovations represent a step in the right direction, providing much-needed assistance in addressing the climate crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## How Supertrees are Engineered
Maddie Hall, CEO of a company engineering these trees, explains the process of [[Genetic engineering for enhanced carbon capture in trees | genetic engineering]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. The process involves incorporating new genes from other plants into plant cells, which are then grown on selection media to develop into shoots and roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### Enhancing Photosynthesis
Natural trees absorb carbon dioxide, sunlight, and water to produce oxygen and sugars through photosynthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Supertrees are designed to make this process more efficient, thereby capturing more carbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

A key target for modification is the enzyme "rubisco," which sometimes takes in oxygen instead of carbon dioxide, leading to "photorespiration." This process wastes energy and releases carbon dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. By altering the expression of genes controlling this process, the efficiency of photosynthesis can be improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

One tool used for this modification is a "gene gun," which coats gold particles with DNA fragments and shoots them into plant cells, incorporating new genes into the plant's genome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This method is popular from a regulatory perspective because it does not introduce any non-plant pest genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Early results indicate that some genetically engineered seedlings show enhanced photosynthesis and a higher rate of carbon assimilation, suggesting a meaningful increase in carbon capture is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## Advantages Over Traditional Tree Planting
When considering why to genetically modify trees instead of simply planting more, Patrick, a co-founder of the company, highlights the scale of the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. To offset human carbon emissions with unaltered trees, an estimated trillion trees would need to be planted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. By increasing the carbon capture ability of individual trees, this number could be significantly reduced, potentially to a little over 500 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. A small change in an individual organism can magnify significantly when applied to a large number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. The goal of this research is not to improve every tree, but to reduce the total number of trees needed to achieve carbon removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### The Carbon Cycle
Traditional [[Challenges and controversies of largescale tree planting | tree planting]] efforts have faced controversy due to the "fast" carbon cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. While trees absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis, much of this carbon is released back into the atmosphere when leaves fall or the tree decomposes, often within a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. This contrasts with the "slow" carbon cycle, where fossil fuels release CO2 trapped underground for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. For trees to significantly aid in climate change mitigation, they need to do more than just participate in the fast carbon cycle; they need to contribute to long-term carbon sequestration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Trees engineered to trap more carbon could be a major help if the carbon they capture remains sequestered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

## Addressing Concerns: Invasive Species
A common concern with [[Genetic engineering for enhanced carbon capture in trees | genetically engineered]] plants in the wild is the risk of creating invasive species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Maddie Hall emphasizes that the company's approach is not to plant a single modified species everywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Instead, they focus on enhancing native species, such as loblolly pine and longleaf pine in Southeastern Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Planting non-native trees, even fast-growing ones, can worsen carbon problems by disrupting local ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. The goal is to provide an example of how photosynthesis can be enhanced in plants native to their environments, inspiring local groups worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. The research on photosynthetic efficiency is shared publicly to encourage other organizations to work on climate change and carbon removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

## Current Progress and Future Vision
While genetically engineered trees might appear larger than unaltered ones at the same age, indicating faster biomass accumulation, there is currently no evidence that they will have a larger final adult size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. They simply reach their mature size more quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

As of late 2023, the company is preparing to scale up to become a commercial tree-planting operation. They have space for 2.6 million trees, with plans to expand to over 10 million. This marks the first commercial planting of a photosynthesis-enhanced organism in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This initiative is seen not as a complete solution to climate change, but as a critical beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

The broader vision behind supertrees extends beyond the plants themselves, touching on humanity's evolving role. Patrick suggests that humans will need to embrace the responsibility of deliberately and continuously regulating Earth's atmospheric composition for the benefit of all living things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. This responsibility, unprecedented for any known species, acknowledges that humans are not the first species to destabilize the atmosphere (as algae did when evolving oxygen), but potentially the last <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. This concept aligns with the broader [[Ethical and ecological considerations for altering species to regulate the atmosphere | ethical and ecological considerations for altering species to regulate the atmosphere]] and the need for [[exploring_potential_future_solutions_to_global_challenges | exploring potential future solutions to global challenges]].

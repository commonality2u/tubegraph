Only 12 people have ever walked on the Moon, all within four years, but for the last 50 years, no one has returned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This is set to change soon, as astronauts will return to the Moon to prepare for long-term habitation and future missions to other planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. To achieve these goals, astronauts need to be able to survive and work for hours in hazardous space conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Current spacesuits for lunar missions haven't been updated in decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, necessitating a major upgrade for this next chapter in space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Axiom Space's Role in Artemis III

[[Axiom Spaces role in Artemis III mission | Axiom Space]] is the company NASA selected to build the [[Axiom Spaces role in Artemis III mission | Artemis III]] spacesuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This marks the first time NASA has outsourced the production of its suits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. These new suits will be used for NASA's upcoming [[Axiom Spaces role in Artemis III mission | Artemis III]] mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

The plan for [[Axiom Spaces role in Artemis III mission | Artemis III]] in 2026 involves four astronauts leaving Earth on a powerful rocket for a multi-day journey to the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Two astronauts will descend to the lunar surface and spend 6.5 days there, twice as long as any previous mission, marking humanity's return since 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. They will be the first humans to explore the lunar south pole, hoping to find resources like water and metals essential for living on the Moon and traveling to Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

To accomplish these extended missions, astronauts need to stay on the lunar surface longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, requiring new protection against extreme heat and cold, especially in areas that never receive sunlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. They also need greater flexibility and range of motion for their tasks, and suits that fit a wider variety of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Survival in Space

The vacuum of space presents numerous lethal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. While common sci-fi portrayals are often incorrect, immediate freezing or exploding is unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

> [00:03:57] "If you snapped your fingers and you were in space right now, your first problem is going to be there's no atmosphere, meaning no oxygen but also meaning no pressure keeping you together like on Earth."

The pressure difference between inside and outside the body would cause all air to rush out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Holding one's breath could cause lung rupture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Within about 15 seconds, the brain would lose oxygen, leading to blackout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. The body would swell as lower pressure reduces the boiling point of water in blood and tissues, turning it into vapor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, though the skin's stretchiness would likely prevent explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

Temperature is another critical factor due to the absence of ambient temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. In direct sunlight, one side of the body could heat up to 150°C, while the other side simultaneously freezes down to -150°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Beyond temperature, exposure to radiation would cause poisoning and cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, and flying objects could cause physical damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Rescue within 90 seconds could lead to survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. This underscores the vital importance of spacesuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Types of Spacesuits

Spacesuits are not merely clothing; they are human-shaped spacecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. There are two primary categories of spacesuits:
*   **Launch and Entry Suits**: These are "high altitude suits" designed to protect astronauts if their vehicle loses atmosphere during ascent or re-entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Examples include the orange Space Shuttle suits and SpaceX's white and black suits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Early Mercury program suits were of this type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **EVA (Extravehicular Activity) Suits**: Also known as "Extravehicular Mobility Units" (EMU), these suits allow astronauts to operate outside a spacecraft, whether on the lunar surface or during spacewalks in low Earth orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

Previous EMUs were difficult to fix in space, posing a challenge for long-term habitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. The new [[design_and_features_of_next_generation_spacesuits | Axiom Space]] suit is designed from the ground up for maintenance on-orbit or during missions, making it more sustainable and potentially lowering spaceflight costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Apollo-era NASA suits cost about $150 million in today's dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. NASA allocated $228 million for the development of the new model, with plans to reduce the per-suit cost as more are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

This shift in spacesuit design reflects a major transition in how humanity approaches space travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## [[design_and_features_of_next_generation_spacesuits | Design and Features of Next Generation Spacesuits]]

Before donning the suit, astronauts wear a liquid cooling garment with tubes circulating water to regulate body temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. For waste management, astronauts use a "MAG" (Maximum Absorbency Garment), commonly known as a diaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

The spacesuit functions by providing an atmosphere, including breathable oxygen and pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. The oxygen system in the final suit will involve a primary life support system in a backpack that processes inhaled and exhaled air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

A spacesuit consists of three major sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>:
1.  **Inner Bladder Layer**: This layer holds the pressure within the suit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.
2.  **Restraint Layer**: Positioned on top of the bladder layer, this stops the suit from inflating like a balloon and defines how the suit can move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. Astronauts train with 1G analog suits to learn specific motions and tool usage within the suit's mobility constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
3.  **Insulation Layer**: This is the black outer layer on the prototype, though the final Moon suit will be white to reflect light and keep cool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. This layer protects against radiation, cuts, and punctures from dust and debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

Spacesuits are pressurized to 4.3 PSI (pounds per square inch), compared to 14.7 PSI at sea level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. This pressure requires ear clearing, similar to diving to the bottom of a pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

The manufacturing process for the new suit is largely handmade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. While cutting is automated, precision stitching often involves slow, hand-operated machines and extensive quality control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. The low volume of spacesuit production makes extensive automation currently unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

New features include advanced boot insulation to protect against the extremely cold lunar surface in permanently shaded regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. Crucially, these suits are designed to fit a wide range of body types, covering 90% of men and women in the United States, unlike previous custom-fit Apollo suits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. This is achieved through a modular design with small, medium, and large base options, allowing for tailored additional pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. This modular approach aims to open space access to more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

## Testing the Suit

The prototype suit, described as feeling "weird" rather than just heavy on Earth, might weigh between 150 to 200 lbs due to Earth's gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. On the Moon, it would feel much lighter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. Pulleys are used during testing to simulate the Moon's reduced gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

Testing challenges faced by a civilian in the suit included:
*   **Sample Collection**: Using a chisel and hammer to simulate breaking off lunar rock samples and then collecting them with tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.
*   **Running (Fast Walking)**: Using a treadmill built for horses to test mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. The movement felt rotational rather than a normal walk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.
*   **Squatting**: Attempting a squat in full Earth gravity, which was significantly difficult due to the suit's weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.
*   **Kneeling and Recovering**: Placing one knee on the ground and standing back up, a position not possible in older EVA suits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.

Astronauts on a real EVA (Extravehicular Activity) day would typically spend about 13 hours in the suit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

The [[design_and_features_of_next_generation_spacesuits | new spacesuit]] is an "incredible piece of technology" and a "marvel of human engineering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. It pushes modern technology to its limits, being a portable spacecraft that protects astronauts while allowing flexibility for tasks like collecting samples, conducting research, and traversing the lunar surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.

This [[design_and_features_of_next_generation_spacesuits | new spacesuit]] is hoped to help humanity reach beyond Earth and unlock an interplanetary future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. Its development highlights the immense amount of work and intricate details involved in designing such critical equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.

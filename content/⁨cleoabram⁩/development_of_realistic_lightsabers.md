Walt Disney Imagineering has developed what is described as the world's most realistic expandable lightsaber for Disney Parks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This innovation was overseen by Lanny Smoot, a renowned Imagineer holding over 100 patents, including the one for this particular lightsaber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. The goal was to create a prop that replicated the visual effects seen in *Star Wars* films for live performances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

## Design and Functionality

In the *Star Wars* universe, lightsaber blades are depicted as channeling energy through a crystal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. For filming the movies, actors used prop sticks, and the glowing effect was added painstakingly in post-production by visual effects artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. The challenge for Disney Imagineers was to create a physical prop that could mimic the smooth extension of the blade seen on screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

The realistic lightsaber achieves its effect through a clever mechanical design:
*   **Internal Motors** The blade unrolls from internal motors that push it outward, enabling a smooth extension, a feature not possible with typical lightsaber toys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Translucent Tapes** It features a clear cap with two long translucent tapes attached. These tapes unroll from inside the hilt, extending upward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Rigid Blade Formation** The tapes bend into a concave shape to create a rigid blade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **LED Illumination** A series of bright LEDs are embedded on these tapes. These LEDs are programmed to create a realistic lightsaber glow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Lighting** The system tracks the angle of movement, causing the lights to blink slightly to simulate motion. Additionally, the LEDs are strobed to give the impression of flickering power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

## Usage and Limitations

This advanced lightsaber prop is primarily designed for its extension and retraction capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. It is not intended for battle or rapid movements. For dynamic scenes requiring quick movements, a stand-in prop is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Despite understanding the technology, the experience of holding and using the lightsaber maintains a sense of magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

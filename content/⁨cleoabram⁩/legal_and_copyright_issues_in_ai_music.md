The emergence of [[aigenerated_music_and_voice_cloning | AI music]] has introduced significant legal and copyright challenges, prompting a "messy fight" within the music industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The central questions revolve around what [[aigenerated_music_and_voice_cloning | AI music]] can do and when artists should be compensated in a world where it exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. These nuances are critical in determining how the final product is treated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Existing Copyright Framework in Music

The music industry has established rules governing compensation, depending on whether an act is defined as inspiration or copying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Copyright law protects two main elements: the original song recording (the master) and the composition of the original song itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. This system is less a strict list of rules and more a history of lawsuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### Forms of Music Reuse and Compensation

*   **Inspiration (No Payment)**: Most music falls into this category, where artists are inspired by others without direct copying that requires payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Sampling (Payment Required)**: Directly copying a portion of someone's original recording, like Doja Cat's "Walk on By," requires payment for both the composition and the original recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Interpolation (Composition Payment)**: Re-recording a line or melody from another song, as Ariana Grande did with "My Favorite Things" in "7 Rings," requires payment to the original composer but not for the original recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Covering (Composition Payment)**: An artist re-records an entire song, such as Miley Cyrus's cover of "Jolene," which necessitates paying the owner of the original composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **[[aigenerated_music_and_voice_cloning | AI Voice Cloning]] (New Recordings, Likeness Payment)**: Artists like Grimes are experimenting with [[aigenerated_music_and_voice_cloning | AI voice cloning]] tools, such as Elf Tech, which allow others to use her voice to create new songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Grimes intends to pay creators who make "really good" songs using her voice, even releasing a competitive [[aigenerated_music_and_voice_cloning | AI]] album alongside her own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. In these cases, because new songs and recordings are made using her voice and likeness, payment is agreed upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

If [[aigenerated_music_and_voice_cloning | AI]] is used to perform any of these actions, artists must still adhere to existing payment structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Copying an artist without payment is exactly what the existing copyright system is designed to prevent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

## The AI Challenge: Training Data vs. Output

A specific question arises with [[aigenerated_music_and_voice_cloning | AI]]: Should artists be paid if an [[aigenerated_music_and_voice_cloning | AI]] trains on their music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>? [[aigenerated_music_and_voice_cloning | AI]] tools require thousands of songs for training, often without full transparency from companies about the data used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

Crucially, these [[aigenerated_music_and_voice_cloning | AI]] tools do not sample, interpolate, or cover music directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Instead, they analyze patterns and generate entirely new works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. The current industry standard for deciding payment is based on the *output*, not the *input* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. This means artists are paid if the end result sounds similar enough to them, regardless of whether their music was used in training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Changing this would involve compensating artists for "inspiration," a category that has historically not required payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

Daniel Ek, CEO of Spotify, notes that Spotify receives music as audio files and wouldn't know the tools used for creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. He respects the debate on training data but emphasizes that the more critical aspect is the *output* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. The line is drawn when the output is "confusingly similar" and drafts off someone else's name and likeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

## The "Vibe" and Autonomous AI

The copyright system becomes particularly complex when dealing with an artist's "vibe," such as songs "in the style of Taylor Swift" or [[aigenerated_music_and_voice_cloning | AI]] collaborations that aren't the artists' original compositions or recordings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. While impersonation is disallowed, parody is permitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Similarly, specific producer tags cannot be copied, but popular phrases or chord progressions can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

A more [[potential_risks_and_benefits_of_ai | profound challenge]] arises if [[aigenerated_music_and_voice_cloning | AI]] becomes more autonomous, transforming from a tool for artists into an artist itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

> "You may have totally autonomous AI agents that are creators on every platform that just generate not 1 song or 100 songs or 1000 songs but like 1 million, 10 million, 100 million, a billion songs and just test their way into what may work. And that's the one I feel is harder to figure out because it's not clear to me who owns the IP and that regard or even how to think about it because is it is it a creator? Is it not a creator? You know the AI we wouldn't treat as a creator but the person behind the AI, we would right?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>

This raises [[the_ethical_and_economic_implications_of_aigenerated_art | existential questions]] about whether listeners care if [[aigenerated_music_and_voice_cloning | AI]] creates music they enjoy, and how to balance the human element of expression with the capabilities of [[ai_as_a_tool_for_creativity_and_expression | AI as a tool]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Ensuring fair compensation for musicians amidst these changes remains a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

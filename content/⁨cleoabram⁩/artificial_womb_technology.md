Artificial womb technology, once considered "straight out of science fiction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, has become a subject of intense public debate and scientific research. Initially met with skepticism, the discussion gained prominence after a Twitter exchange involving Elon Musk and others regarding population collapse and the burden of pregnancy on women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Current State of Research

While the concept of an artificial womb for humans is still far from reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, significant advancements in the field are underway.

### Dr. Jacob Hanna's Work

Dr. Jacob Hanna and his team have achieved a groundbreaking feat by growing mouse embryos outside the uterus, past the blastocyst stage where nearly all organs are formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Traditionally, it was believed that the uterus was essential for correct organ formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This research demonstrates that this critical part of mammal development can occur in an artificial environment, marking a major leap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Other Studies

Another notable study involved growing a lamb in an artificial environment for about a month, starting two-thirds of the way through its pregnancy, long after its organs had formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

The development of artificial wombs is not expected to come from one single new technology, but rather through the slow, incremental movement of science, with pieces gradually coming together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## The Debate: More Harm or More Good?

The debate surrounding artificial wombs often boils down to whether their development would cause more harm or more good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### Arguments Against

Critics suggest that focusing on artificial wombs is a "big distraction" from more immediate needs, such as investing in parental leave and affordable childcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Concerns also include the potential for misuse, such as controlling reproduction, "breeding babies," or "manufacturing children in factories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Additionally, some argue that pregnancy is a special and important experience that technology could never replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### Arguments For

Proponents highlight that pregnancy poses significant risks; childbirth, for example, kills over 800 women globally every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. They also argue that pregnancy can hold women back, contributing to the wage gap through what is often called a "motherhood penalty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Bearing children can be painful, with 30-45% of women reporting a traumatic birth experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. For many, an artificial womb is seen as a "dream come true" that could "change the lives of many people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Crucial Near-Term [[applications_of_artificial_womb_research | Applications of Artificial Womb Research]]

Beyond the long-term vision of full artificial wombs for humans, the research is crucial for several near-term benefits that support pregnancy and broader medical advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### 1. Helping Premature Babies Survive

Research in this area contributes to developing new tools and technologies, like advanced incubators and "liquid ventilation," which help premature babies develop their lungs and survive outside the uterus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

### 2. Growing Organs for Transplants

A significant motivation for Dr. Hanna's research is to learn about organ development to facilitate growing independent organs for transplants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This could address the critical shortage of organs for transplant, with over 106,000 people on waiting lists in the U.S. and 17 dying daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Growing organs from a patient's own cells would eliminate the need for donors and prevent transplant rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

### 3. Learning About Human Development

Studying human (or any mammal) development in utero is challenging due to the "black box" nature of the uterus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Technologies enabling embryos to develop outside the uterus, as seen with zebra fish embryos, allow scientists to observe and understand developmental processes over time, which was previously impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

## Personal Perspective and the Future of Pregnancy

The speaker's personal experience with ovarian cysts and a necessary surgery to preserve her ability to have children highlighted the physical toll and risks associated with reproductive health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a>. This personal crisis underscored the idea that pregnancy is "incredibly hard" and for humans, a "painful, medically complicated process" due to anatomical factors like narrow hips and large brains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:53">[01:06:53]</a>.

Despite the inherent difficulties, the speaker emphasizes that the existence of a child requires someone to undergo pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:43">[01:07:43]</a>. While acknowledging the beauty, she also recognizes the brutal reality of pregnancy and believes it should not have to be "superhuman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>. The pursuit of artificial wombs is framed as an endeavor to provide more options, reduce risk, and lessen pain in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.

## Historical Parallels and the Obligation to Search

The controversy surrounding artificial wombs is not unique in medical history. [[egg_freezing_process_and_personal_journey | IVF]] technology, for example, faced significant opposition when it was first introduced, with claims of immorality and "Hitlerian" possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">[01:19:21]</a>.

However, as one doctor from that time stated, "There is an obligation to relieve suffering when the means to do so are available, or in the absence of the means, to search for the means" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:43">[01:19:43]</a>. This philosophy suggests a continued search for advancements in reproductive technology, including those related to artificial wombs, to alleviate suffering and expand human options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:52">[01:19:52]</a>.

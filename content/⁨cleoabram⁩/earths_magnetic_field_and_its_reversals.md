The Earth's magnetic field is a crucial protective layer, but its behavior, particularly its reversals, remains a subject of scientific inquiry.

## Formation and Importance
The Earth's magnetic field is generated by the constant churning of a hot, liquid soup of metals within the [[geological_layers_of_the_earth | outer core]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This movement creates enormous electric currents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. The magnetic field is vital for life on Earth, as it protects the surface from cosmic radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## Magnetic Reversals
The Earth's magnetic field sometimes reverses, causing the North and South poles to slowly swap places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### Evidence from the Ocean Floor
Scientists can observe these magnetic reversals by examining the [[historical_significance_of_ocean_floor_maps | ocean floor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. As basalt erupts along mid-ocean ridges, it records the magnetic field's orientation at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. As tectonic plates continue to be created and pulled apart, this record can be read like a barcode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

### Last Reversal and Future Predictions
The last known reversal of the Earth's magnetic field occurred approximately 780,000 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Scientists are not sure when the next reversal will happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

## Connection to the Inner Core
Recent [[seismic_waves_and_their_role_in_understanding_earths_interior | seismic data]] and computer models of the magnetic fields suggest that the Earth's [[exploration_and_discoveries_about_earths_core | inner core]] rotates at a different rate than the surface, and this rate changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. The [[exploration_and_discoveries_about_earths_core | inner core]] appears to speed up and slow down on a roughly 70-year cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. This is distinct from a magnetic field reversal; if one were on the outside of the [[exploration_and_discoveries_about_earths_core | inner core]] and observed from the surface, it would appear to be moving in the opposite direction if it were slowing down, even if both were moving in the same general direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

## Current Research
Scientists are actively working to predict the Earth's magnetic field and when it might flip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. This involves building experiments that mimic the inner Earth, analyzing [[seismic_waves_and_their_role_in_understanding_earths_interior | seismic waves]] with improved computational models, and finding ways to replicate deep Earth conditions on the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

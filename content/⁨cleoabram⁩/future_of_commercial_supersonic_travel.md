Twenty years ago, it was possible to fly commercially faster than the speed of sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. The Concorde, a supersonic plane, could travel from New York to London in 3.5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. Passengers could see the curvature of the Earth while enjoying champagne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. This era of commercial supersonic flight ended, with current New York to London flights taking 7 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

## The Concorde Era: A Look Back

The Concorde was the world's first commercial supersonic flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a> and the "most exciting aircraft the world had ever seen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.
It was designed in the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a> and had a unique appearance, described as "every child's paper dart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

**Key Features & Performance:**
*   **Speed** The Concorde flew at 1,350 mph, which is approximately twice the speed of sound (Mach 1, 767 mph) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. For context, this is similar to the top speed of a military F-16 fighter jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.
*   **Altitude** It flew so high that passengers could observe the curvature of the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.
*   **Design** The aircraft featured a long, narrow body for streamlined air resistance, wide delta-shaped wings for lift, a "droop snoot" nose that articulated during takeoff and landing for pilot visibility, powerful engines for rapid air intake, and special heat-discharging paint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.
*   **Experience** While expensive, many paid for the thrill of [[history_and_legacy_of_supersonic_flight|supersonic flight]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. Inside the plane, there was no physical indication of crossing the sound barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.

## The Problem: Sonic Boom and Regulations

A significant [[challenges_faced_by_supersonic_planes|challenge faced by supersonic planes]] is the sonic boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. This occurs because when a plane flies faster than sound, air molecules cannot move out of the way in time, creating compressed pressure waves at the front and back of the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. These waves are heard as a "double bang" on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>, not just when the plane hits supersonic speed, but continuously along its flight path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. The Concorde's sonic boom was comparable in loudness to a balloon popping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.

In 1973, due to the loudness of these booms, the FAA banned commercial supersonic flights over the United States, with similar bans following globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. This severely limited flight routes, primarily to over-ocean travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>. Combined with high fuel consumption, rising fuel costs, and a fatal crash in 2000, public reception declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>. Air France and subsequently British Airways retired their Concorde fleets by 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.

## NASA's X-59: The Quest for Quiet Supersonic Flight

[[NASAs_X59_supersonic_plane_development|NASA's X-59 supersonic plane development]] is an attempt to solve the sonic boom problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. This experimental single-seater jet can travel at 925 mph (1.4 times the speed of sound) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>. Its primary goal is to prove that supersonic planes can be quiet, aiming to change current regulations that prohibit supersonic flight over land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.

**Design Innovations for Quieter Flight:**
*   **Long Nose** The X-59 features an exceptionally long, 38-foot carbon fiber nose that remains fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>. Unlike the Concorde's droop snoot, the pilot uses a camera system for forward visibility during takeoff and landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>. This elongated nose is crucial for reducing the sonic boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.
*   **Aerodynamic Smoothing** The plane's underside is exceptionally smooth and clean, directing any potential shockwaves upwards and away from the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.
*   **T-Tail** A unique T-tail design creates its own shockwave that interacts with and cancels out some of the trailing boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.
*   **Anti-Static Paint** A special anti-static paint prevents the buildup of static electricity as the plane moves through the air, similar to Teflon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>.

NASA is aiming for a sound level of 75 perceived level decibels, which would sound like a neighbor closing a car door outside their house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>. The X-59 is a one-off demonstration aircraft, not a passenger plane, designed solely to prove the concept of low-boom supersonic flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>.

## The Future of Commercial Supersonic Travel

If NASA succeeds in demonstrating quiet supersonic flight and helps change the existing regulations, it could "open the floodgates" for more companies and planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>. Several private companies, such as Boom, are actively working to bring back commercial supersonic travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>.

However, the return of passenger supersonic flight is not immediate. It is anticipated to be at least a decade away, with Boom aiming for market entry by the end of the current decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>. Despite the timeline, the industry is confident, with three airlines having already placed orders for future supersonic planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.

**Requirements for New Supersonic Planes:**
*   **Sustainability** New planes must be more sustainable and not consume fuel like the Concorde <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>.
*   **Affordability** They will need to be cheaper to operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>.
*   **Capacity** They must be capable of carrying more than one passenger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:00]</a>.

The promise of supersonic flight extends beyond just speed; it represents greater connection and the ability for humans to explore more of the world by shrinking its perceived size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>. With the lessons learned from the Concorde era, there is optimism that a new generation of supersonic airliners will offer public travel in the not-too-distant future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>.

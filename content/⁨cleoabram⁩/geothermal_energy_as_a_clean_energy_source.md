Geothermal energy, derived from the Earth's internal heat, represents an "almost limitless renewable source" that could potentially "sustain all of humanity for the foreseeable future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. The US agency responsible for researching advanced energy technologies estimates that just "0.1% of the heat content of Earth could supply humanity’s total energy needs for 2 million years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. Despite this immense potential, geothermal energy has remained largely "untapped" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a> and is less commonly discussed than other renewables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>. However, it is emerging as one of the "hottest areas" in energy research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.

## Traditional Geothermal Extraction

Historically, obtaining geothermal energy at scale has involved tapping into natural reservoirs of hot water and steam found underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. This process involves drilling down, finding hot steam, and channeling it up through a turbine to generate electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. The heat can also be used directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

A major limitation of this approach is that it requires finding naturally occurring hot water reservoirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>. While there is a vast amount of energy deeper within the Earth, it remains unharnessable if a natural reservoir isn't present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.

## [[enhanced_geothermal_technology_using_fracking_techniques | Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS)]]

A promising development in [[the_role_of_innovation_and_technology_in_clean_energy | clean energy innovation]] is [[enhanced_geothermal_technology_using_fracking_techniques | enhanced geothermal technology]], which seeks to overcome the limitations of traditional geothermal by creating reservoirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. This approach involves drilling into hot rock, injecting water, and cracking the rock to allow the water to pass through and heat up. The heated water is then collected to spin a turbine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.

This method conceptually mirrors the process known as "fracking" (hydraulic fracturing), which was perfected for extracting fossil fuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>. The [[the_role_of_innovation_and_technology_in_clean_energy | technology]] developed to extract oil and gas from deep rock, which involved pumping fluid at high pressure to crack it open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>, is now seen as key to unlocking a much larger, clean energy source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

Professor Mukul Sharma, known as the "Frack King" for his expertise in improving hydraulic fracturing processes for oil and gas companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>, is now working on how to "frack geothermal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. He believes this [[the_role_of_innovation_and_technology_in_clean_energy | technology]] "would enable geothermal to finally become more commercial" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.

## Addressing Concerns: Fracking for Fossil Fuels vs. Geothermal

The original application of fracking for oil and gas raised significant environmental concerns, including:
*   **Groundwater Pollution**: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) linked oil and gas fracking to groundwater pollution, particularly from accidents involving leftover fluids that return to the surface, and potentially from cracks in pipes if not operating correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. The fluid used contains chemicals beneficial for extraction but harmful to people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.
*   **Earthquakes**: The disposal of wastewater by injecting it back into the ground has been linked to seismic activity in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

However, the concerns associated with fracking for fossil fuels "do not apply to geothermal" in the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>.
*   **Fluid Composition**: For [[enhanced_geothermal_technology_using_fracking_techniques | enhanced geothermal]], the injected fluid is typically "just water, or close to water," making them "environmentally benign fluids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. This eliminates the main source of environmental objection related to chemical contamination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>.
*   **Seismic Activity**: While there is a concern that [[enhanced_geothermal_technology_using_fracking_techniques | enhanced geothermal technology]] could cause seismic activity if done poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>, "the science now has reached a point that that risk is very tiny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>. Experts believe it can be done safely, emphasizing the need for preventative measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.

## The Role of Geothermal in a Clean Energy Future

As the world seeks to reduce its dependence on [[transitioning_from_fossil_fuels_to_clean_energy | fossil fuels]] due to their undeniable contribution to climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>, [[clean energy]] sources like wind and solar are expanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. However, to ensure constant energy availability, especially during periods of less wind or cloudier skies, reliable baseload options are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>. Geothermal energy could play a significant role here, providing "extremely reliable" power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>.

While closed-loop geothermal systems are also in development, they may limit energy extraction rates compared to systems utilizing fracturing due to less contact between fluids and the hot rock surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. Therefore, [[enhanced_geothermal_technology_using_fracking_techniques | enhanced geothermal technology]] using fracturing, if done safely, offers the potential to extract significantly more energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.

The application of "fracking" technology, once a contributor to climate change through fossil fuel extraction, now presents an opportunity for a "redemption story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>. It highlights how [[the_role_of_innovation_and_technology_in_clean_energy | technology]] itself is neither inherently good nor bad, but rather its impact depends on how it is utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>. As the world confronts [[challenges_and_solutions_in_increasing_clean_energy_production | challenges in increasing clean energy production]], harnessing every available option, including [[enhanced_geothermal_technology_using_fracking_techniques | enhanced geothermal technology]], becomes essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.

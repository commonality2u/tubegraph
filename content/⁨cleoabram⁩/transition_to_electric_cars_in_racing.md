The landscape of motorsport is undergoing a significant shift, driven by the broader global move towards electric vehicles. This transition presents an [[innovation_and_future_directions_in_formula_1 | existential moment]] for traditional racing, particularly [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]], as electric cars become increasingly prevalent on public roads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

## The Tipping Point for Gas Cars
For years, governments worldwide have discussed banning the sale of new gas cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. California has already implemented such a ban, and the entire European Union plans to follow suit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. By 2040, owning a car with a tailpipe could be considered outdated technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

This shift poses a problem for [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]], which relies heavily on advertising cutting-edge car technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. If the technology showcased in [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | F1]] becomes outdated, it risks losing investment and relevance, potentially becoming akin to horse racing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

## [[origins_and_development_of_formula_e | Origins and Development of Formula E]]
The idea for a fully electric car racing series, known as [[origins_and_development_of_formula_e | Formula E]], emerged from a dinner in Paris 11 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. Key figures at this dinner included:
*   **Alejandro Agag:** A Spanish businessman and former member of the European Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
*   **Antonio Tajani:** Former European Commissioner for Transport, responsible for transportation regulation across the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.
*   **Jean Todt:** President of the FIA, the governing body that oversees [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

During this dinner, they recognized the impending shift towards electrification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

### [[challenges_of_adapting_formula_1_to_electric_cars | Challenges for Formula 1 to Go Electric]]
At the time, [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] could not simply switch to electric cars for several reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>:
*   **Battery Limitations:** Eleven years ago, electric car batteries could not sustain a [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | F1]] race's required distance (at least 305 kilometers or 190 miles) within two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.
*   **Resistance from Car Companies:** In 2011, most of [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | F1]]'s major car companies did not produce electric cars and did not want the sport to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.

This presented an "innovator's dilemma" for [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | F1]], a large incumbent unable to risk threatening its existing structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

### The Birth of [[origins_and_development_of_formula_e | Formula E]]
Instead of changing [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]], Jean Todt proposed creating a new, separate electric championship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. This new championship, [[origins_and_development_of_formula_e | Formula E]], was designed to be a "space program for electric cars," pushing technology forward rapidly to shape the future of both car racing and consumer cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

A key agreement was made: [[origins_and_development_of_formula_e | Formula E]] received an exclusive 25-year license for fully electric racing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. This means [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] cannot become fully electric without conflicting with this license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. The license began with [[origins_and_development_of_formula_e | Formula E]]'s launch in 2014 and expires in 2039, four years after the EU and California's bans on new gas car sales take effect in 2035 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.

## Making [[origins_and_development_of_formula_e | Formula E]] Entertaining
To attract viewers to the new sport, the goal was to create the most entertaining sport possible while advancing electric car technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. Inspiration was drawn from video games, specifically Mario Kart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

Key innovations and rules include:
*   **City Center Racing:** [[origins_and_development_of_formula_e | Formula E]] races take place on street circuits in city centers, bringing the event closer to people and conveying the message that electric cars are a solution for urban mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.
*   **Attack Mode:** Similar to a Mario Kart boost, drivers can go off the racing line to gain extra energy for four minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.
*   **Fan Boost:** Audiences vote to give a specific driver a temporary speed boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>. (Note: This rule is being retired in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>).

These flexible and fun ideas set [[origins_and_development_of_formula_e | Formula E]] apart from the more traditional [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>.

## [[technological_innovations_in_formula_e | Technological Innovations in Formula E]]
[[origins_and_development_of_formula_e | Formula E]] cars have evolved significantly since the series began, with these improvements mirroring advances in consumer electric vehicles:

### Gen 1 Cars (2014 Launch)
The first [[origins_and_development_of_formula_e | Formula E]] cars, Gen 1, faced the challenge of battery limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. Electric cars in 2014 typically had a maximum range of about 250 miles per charge, and racing speeds depleted batteries even faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>.
*   **Solution:** Drivers were given two cars per race, and during pit stops, they would physically switch from one car to the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.

### Gen 2 Cars
After four years of racing Gen 1 cars, the Gen 2 car was introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>. The major improvement was that Gen 2 cars could cover twice the distance, allowing drivers to complete an entire race with just one car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.

### Gen 3 Cars
The Gen 3 car is the fastest and most powerful electric race car ever built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>. Unlike [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]], [[origins_and_development_of_formula_e | Formula E]] teams must use the same chassis, battery, and most ancillary parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>. This design encourages teams to focus their investment and experimentation on powertrain components that convert battery energy into speed, such as the rear motor, inverter, gearbox, and associated software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. This approach is a direct response to controlling the escalating costs seen in [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>.

The Gen 3 car features:
*   **Increased Power:** From 250 kilowatts to 350 kilowatts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.
*   **Reduced Weight:** From just over 900 kilograms to about 850 kilograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>.
*   **Innovative Braking System:** The Gen 3 car has no rear mechanical brakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>. Instead, the electric motors themselves stop the car by converting kinetic energy back into electrical energy, which recharges the batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>. Up to 80% of the energy can be recuperated back into the battery during braking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>. This is a significant step forward that could be integrated into future consumer electric cars, leading to greater range, faster charging, and cleaner driving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>.

## [[innovation_and_future_directions_in_formula_1 | Formula 1's Response: Going Hybrid]]
Around the same time [[origins_and_development_of_formula_e | Formula E]] was launching, [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] announced its biggest set of rule changes in a generation, embracing a hybrid powertrain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>. Every [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | F1]] car would now be powered by a hybrid system featuring a turbo engine and two electric motors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.

However, due to [[origins_and_development_of_formula_e | Formula E]]'s exclusive license for *purely electric* racing, [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] can only incorporate hybrid technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>. While [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] could potentially go 99% electric with 1% fuel, their next generation of engines is moving towards an almost 50/50 split between electric and fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>. This suggests that [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | F1]] would go fully electric if not for the licensing conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.

## The Future of Car Racing
The racing world is at a crossroads where the technology demonstrated on the track must align with the technology being sold to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>. With combustion cars potentially becoming illegal, the relevance of racing that technology diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>.

Speculation exists about a potential merger between [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] and [[origins_and_development_of_formula_e | Formula E]] in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>. Regardless, both sports are actively working to develop better technology that will ultimately benefit everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:00">[13:29:00]</a>.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg envisions a future where technology fosters deeper human connection, leveraging advancements in augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This vision aims to address declining in-person socialization trends and provide new avenues for presence and interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.

## Next-Generation Computing Platforms

Zuckerberg believes that AR glasses will be the next major computing platform after phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:59">[03:59:59]</a>. This evolution moves computing from mainframes and desktop PCs to phones, and now towards more ubiquitous, natural, and social forms of interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:04">[04:04:04]</a>.

### Holographic Augmented Reality Glasses

Meta has spent 10 years developing its first full holographic augmented reality glasses, internally referred to as "Tony Stark glasses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, which are complex prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:29">[02:29:29]</a>. These glasses are designed to miniaturize necessary computing power into a normal-looking form factor, capable of projecting full holograms into the real world with a wide field of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:43">[02:43:43]</a>.

In the future, these glasses could enable [[digital_teleportation and the future of virtual presence | full-body holograms]] of people, allowing for interaction beyond simple video calls, such as playing games like ping-pong or poker, working together, or sharing experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:06">[03:06:06]</a>. This technology is expected to revolutionize various fields, including work, productivity, science, education, entertainment, and gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:29">[03:29:29]</a>.

The intricate design of these glasses includes:
*   Micro-projectors that shoot light into wave guides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.
*   A waveguide system with nano-etchings that create holograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:11">[05:11:11]</a>.
*   Eye tracking with small cameras to synchronize with the user's gaze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:30">[05:30:30]</a>.
*   Integrated computing, batteries, microphones, and speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:35">[05:35:35]</a>.
*   Cameras and sensors to understand the surrounding physical world for accurate hologram placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:48">[05:48:48]</a>.
*   Radio communication with other computing devices for heavier processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:15">[06:15:15]</a>.
*   A wrist-based neural interface for input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:19">[06:19:19]</a>.

### Product Lines for Digital Interaction

Meta anticipates several permanent product lines for digital objects in physical space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:35">[08:35:35]</a>:
*   **Display-less glasses:** Such as the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, which focus on form factor and integrate AI without a visual display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:06">[08:06:06]</a>. These are more affordable and continue to improve for AI interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:40">[08:40:40]</a>.
*   **Heads-up display glasses:** An intermediate option with a smaller field of view (e.g., 20-30 degrees), useful for AI conversations, receiving text messages via a wrist-based neural interface, directions, or information search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:51">[08:51:51]</a>.
*   **Full holographic AR glasses:** Like the prototype discussed, designed for immersive experiences with full holograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:38">[09:38:38]</a>. These are expected to be the most premium but generally accessible over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:46">[09:46:46]</a>.
*   **Mixed reality headsets:** Such as Meta Quest 3, which offer high-quality mixed reality at accessible prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:55">[09:55:55]</a>. Headsets will continue to be important as they can fit more compute than glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:01">[10:01:01]</a>.

## Driving Values: Presence and Personalized AI

Meta's core mission with these technologies is to deliver two primary values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:28">[11:28:28]</a>:

### The Feeling of Presence
The [[impact_of_virtual_reality_on_human_connection_and_relationships | feeling of presence]] is the central value of AR and mixed reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:34">[11:34:34]</a>. This refers to the profound sense of being physically present with another person, which is often a visceral reaction to virtual or mixed reality experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:45">[11:45:45]</a>. The goal is to create a technology platform that delivers a deep sense of social presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:08">[12:08:08]</a>.

Key aspects of achieving presence:
*   **Eye contact:** Expected to be achieved well before physical touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:41">[14:41:41]</a>.
*   **Haptics:** Progress is being made, especially for hands, considered the most important sensory area to start with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:53">[14:53:53]</a>. Demos like virtual ping-pong with tactile feedback demonstrate this progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:21">[15:21:21]</a>.
*   **Force feedback:** The hardest aspect, necessary for highly physical interactions like Jiu-Jitsu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:59">[15:59:59]</a>.
*   **Smell:** While important for memory, it's a difficult challenge not expected in devices in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38:38">[16:38:38]</a>.

Achieving presence is about delivering a convincing illusion, where any error can break the immersion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:01">[17:01:01]</a>. Factors that can break presence include a field of view that is too low or unrealistic physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:01">[18:01:01]</a>.

### Avatars and Realism
Work on [[the_evolution_of_avatars_and_their_role_in_digital_communication | avatars]], including photorealistic "Kodak avatars" and more expressive cartoony avatars, aims to enhance presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:25:25">[18:25:25]</a>. Interestingly, people are generally comfortable mixing photorealistic avatars with cartoon worlds, or vice-versa, as long as the avatars move authentically to the person they represent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:49:49">[18:49:49]</a>. The realism in movement, even with less photorealistic avatars, contributes to the sense of presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27:27">[19:27:27]</a>.

### Personalized AI
The second key value is [[future_of_ai_and_personalized_ai | personalized AI]], powered by models like Llama and Meta AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:13">[12:13:13]</a>. For AI to be truly personalized, it needs context from a user's life and physical surroundings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:31">[12:31:31]</a>. Glasses are considered the ideal form factor for this, as they are positioned to see what the user sees and hear what they hear, which are the two most important senses for gathering world context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:49">[12:49:49]</a>.

## Addressing the Decline in Human Connection

Research indicates a concerning trend: the average American has fewer friends now than 15 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:25">[20:25:25]</a>. In-person socializing among American adults has dropped by nearly 30% over the last 20 years, with a nearly 70% decrease for ages 15-24 according to the Surgeon General <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:43:43">[20:43:43]</a>. The share of Americans reporting no close friends has jumped from 3% to 12% in the last 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:15:15">[21:15:15]</a>.

Zuckerberg argues that digital connection, especially through immersive platforms, will not replace existing physical connections but rather supplement them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:07:07">[22:07:07]</a>. The aim is to unlock more opportunities for people to be present with others who are physically distant, thereby fulfilling a "demand to socialize" that current structures don't meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:37:37">[22:37:37]</a>.

## AI's Impact on Human Interaction

[[social_media_evolution_and_ai_impacts | Generative AI]] is expected to profoundly change social media by providing tools for users to create funnier memes and more interesting content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:03:03">[32:03:03]</a>. AI can automatically edit captured content from glasses, or even generate content purely by the system, personalized for the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:27:27">[33:27:27]</a>.

The rise of AI creators, or creators building AI versions of themselves, is also anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:46:46">[33:46:46]</a>. These AI "artifacts" or "interactive sculptures" would allow communities to interact with a creator's persona even when the creator is unavailable, extending their reach and fostering community growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:20:20">[34:20:20]</a>.

Zuckerberg believes AI will change almost every field and feature of every application, comparable to the impact of the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:04:04">[35:04:04]</a>.

### AI and Cognitive Development
A key debate revolves around how AI impacts human capabilities. While AI can remove struggles, like real-time language translation, some struggles (e.g., learning a language or articulating emotions) are crucial for building human "muscles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:42:42">[24:42:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:27:27">[25:27:27]</a>.

Zuckerberg suggests that AI will allow people to focus on higher-level creativity rather than low-level tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:34:34">[27:34:34]</a>. For example, kids will be able to describe complex software they want to build, and AI will create it, shifting the "struggle" to refining and iterating on the AI's output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:39:39">[27:39:39]</a>.

He argues that some foundational skills, like basic math or programming, remain important even with advanced AI tools, as they teach rigorous thinking and general numeracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:01:01">[29:01:01]</a>. While AI might make learning multiple languages less functionally relevant due to perfect real-time translation (like the new feature on Ray-Ban Metas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:18:18">[31:18:18]</a>, the cultural and structural insights gained from language learning still hold value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:49:49">[30:49:49]</a>.

## Open Source AI and Safety

Zuckerberg advocates for an open-source approach to AI development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:23:23">[39:23:23]</a>. He contrasts Meta's vision of a diverse ecosystem of AI systems, similar to different apps and websites, with other companies (e.g., OpenAI, Google) building a single, centralized AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:52:52">[39:52:52]</a>. Open source allows everyone to modify and build upon AI models, fostering diversity and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:05:05">[41:05:05]</a>.

Regarding safety, Zuckerberg believes that open-source AI is safer and more secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:26:26">[41:26:26]</a>. Historically, open-source software becomes more robust because wider scrutiny reveals and fixes issues more quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:05:05">[42:05:05]</a>. This counterintuitive dynamic means that despite concerns about misuse by "bad developers," greater transparency and community involvement lead to smarter and safer models for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:12:12">[43:12:12]</a>.

## The Future of AI Scaling

A significant open question in the AI field is how far current transformer-based architectures can scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:17:17">[44:17:17]</a>. Unlike previous AI architectures that hit plateaus, these new methods have not yet found an end to their scaling capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:44:44">[44:44:44]</a>.

Meta is making substantial infrastructure investments (hundreds of billions of dollars) based on the bet that AI will continue to advance significantly for quite a while, leading to new compelling products and a dynamic technological landscape over the next 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:36:36">[45:36:36]</a>. However, it remains possible that these systems could hit a limit, which would lead to a different, potentially slower, trajectory of AI advances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:06:06">[45:06:06]</a>.

The show "Huge If True" has spent two years exploring new ideas and technologies that could significantly alter the world, including humanoid robots, quantum computers, new supersonic planes, and particle colliders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This exploration is driven by the belief that envisioning better futures makes them more likely to materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Introducing "Huge Conversations"

A new format, "Huge Conversations," is being introduced to provide longer, more in-depth, and optimistic discussions with key individuals shaping the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. These [[interviews_with_tech_innovators_shaping_the_future|conversations]] aim to engage with people whose visions of the future could soon impact billions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### An Optimistic Lens on Success

Unlike many interviews that focus on past or potential failures of tech innovators, "Huge Conversations" is interested in the opposite question: what if they succeed? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> This approach suggests that success might lead to significant improvements and solve critical problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### The Double-Edged Sword of Progress

While success can bring positive change, it's acknowledged that some of humanity's biggest challenges arise not from failure, but from success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Many contemporary problems are considered a direct result of progress itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

The show aims to ask cutting-edge innovators to describe the future they are building, grappling with both the inherent "promise and the perils" of its realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. An [[importance_of_optimistic_visions_for_future_innovation|optimistic lens]] is deemed necessary to fully explore these complex implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The goal is to clearly present these imagined futures, allowing viewers to decide if they wish to contribute to their development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

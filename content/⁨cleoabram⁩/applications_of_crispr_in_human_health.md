[[Gene editing and CRISPR technology | CRISPR-Cas9]] is a microscopic technology that provides the capability to edit human genes, even while a person is alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This power allows for the potential to cure diseases, prevent others, enhance bodily functions, and potentially even bestow new abilities on future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. [[Gene editing and CRISPR technology | CRISPR]] is already in use in real medicines, as well as in [[CRISPR in agriculture and environmental impact | plants]] and [[CRISPR in agriculture and environmental impact | animals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Jennifer Doudna won the Nobel Prize for its discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## The Breakthrough of CRISPR
For over a century, scientists have known that cells contain molecules carrying genetic information in a four-part code, which acts as a blueprint for making proteins that govern human traits, from appearance to disease susceptibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. However, for most of that time, this genetic code could only be read, not changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

Early forms of gene manipulation involved studying how viruses, like HIV, naturally insert into human DNA, providing insights into how DNA sequences could be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Tools like Zinc-finger nucleases and TALEN proteins were developed to alter specific DNA letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. While these demonstrated the power of DNA manipulation, they were "bespoke," meaning a new tool had to be created for each specific change, making them expensive and time-consuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

[[Gene editing and CRISPR technology | CRISPR]] emerged as a programmable tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Viruses and bacteria, through eons of natural interaction, developed systems using proteins directed by RNA molecules to interact with and easily recode DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This understanding allowed scientists to easily manipulate and change DNA sequences that [[Gene editing and CRISPR technology | CRISPR]] could recognize, making it a quick, precise, and easily controllable "text editor" for the instruction manual of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Ethical Considerations: Somatic vs. Germline Editing
The newfound ability to manipulate DNA raises profound [[ethical_considerations_of_genome_editing | ethical considerations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. A key distinction lies between editing somatic cells (non-reproductive cells) and germline cells (cells involved in reproduction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

*   **Somatic Cell Editing**: Changes made to somatic cells would affect only the individual and would not be passed down to future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Germline Editing**: Changes made to germline cells or embryos would be permanent and inherited by all future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This raises significant concerns, including historical echoes of eugenics and the profound impact on human identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. An embryo cannot consent to such a change, and the long-term effects on populations are unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

## Current and Potential Applications in Human Health

### Curing Existing Diseases
[[Gene editing and CRISPR technology | CRISPR]] holds immense promise for treating diseases caused by single gene mutations.

*   **Sickle Cell Disease**: This severe blood disease results from a single genetic mutation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
    *   In late 2023, the FDA and its UK counterpart approved a [[Gene editing and CRISPR technology | CRISPR]]-based therapy for sickle cell disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
    *   This "one-and-done" therapy doesn't directly cure the mutation but suppresses its effect by turning on the production of fetal hemoglobin, a protein normally made only in the womb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
    *   Patients like Victoria Gray, the first U.S. patient, have not experienced another sickle cell crisis since treatment, leading to transformed lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
    *   **Challenges**: The current therapy is very expensive, requires hospitalization for a bone marrow transplant, limiting global access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Researchers are working to make it more accessible and deliverable within the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

*   **Huntington's Disease**: This neurodegenerative disease is also caused by a single, well-defined gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.
    *   It often runs in families and typically begins in midlife, causing severe brain degeneration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.
    *   While not yet a current treatment, [[Gene editing and CRISPR technology | CRISPR]] could potentially remove this disease-causing mutation from an embryo, preventing the individual from developing Huntington's and from passing the trait to their children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.
    *   **Challenges**: The process of DNA repair in embryos is still under investigation, and it is not yet safe enough to be used in this context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. However, some argue that it would be "unethical not to use it" if it were safely possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

### Preventing Future Diseases
[[Gene editing and CRISPR technology | CRISPR]] could be used preventatively for diseases with a genetic predisposition.

*   **High Cholesterol/Cardiovascular Disease**: A clinical trial is underway using [[Gene editing and CRISPR technology | CRISPR]] to make edits in the liver's DNA to prevent cholesterol accumulation in susceptible individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. This could be a one-time therapy, eliminating the need for daily medication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>.
    *   **Delivery Mechanism**: The liver is a unique organ that naturally filters molecules. The therapy uses lipid nanoparticles, similar to those in COVID vaccines, which naturally traffic to the liver and carry the [[Gene editing and CRISPR technology | CRISPR]] molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>.
*   **Alzheimer's and Cancer**: While more complex, [[Gene editing and CRISPR technology | CRISPR]] is being explored for its potential to reduce risk factors related to genes like APOE4 for Alzheimer's and BRCA for cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>.

#### Challenges in Delivery
A major challenge for applying [[Gene editing and CRISPR technology | CRISPR]] to many diseases is delivering the molecules to specific cells or organs in the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. The body contains many cell types, and a disease may only affect a subset of them (e.g., Alzheimer's in the brain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. The goal is to target only the affected cells without disturbing others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. This requires understanding "zip code molecules" on cell surfaces to distinguish types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Viruses are inspirations for this, as they are adept at targeted delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. The analogy used is that while we can "cut and paste DNA," we are "still inventing the postal system" to deliver these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

### "Enhancements" and Superpowers
Beyond treating disease, [[Gene editing and CRISPR technology | CRISPR]] raises questions about enhancements, potentially leading to new human capabilities. This area presents a "gray area" where defining the line between health-related improvements and pure enhancements is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.

*   **Muscle Mass**: Editing the MSTN gene is associated with building larger muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>.
*   **Reduced Sleep Need**: The DEEC2 gene is associated with needing less sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>.
*   **Pain Tolerance**: Natural variations of a gene involved in pain perception exist, allowing some individuals to be naturally pain tolerant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. This could theoretically be used to reduce pain in patients with chronic conditions or cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>.
*   **Super Enhancements**: Some speculate about "super enhancements" that could push humans beyond current normal capabilities, like creating "super athletes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>. However, these are largely unrealistic currently because the complex interconnections between genes are not fully understood, meaning tweaking one gene could have unforeseen health consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>.

### Editing the Human Microbiome
A distinct but related application involves editing the microorganisms within the human body rather than the human cells themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>.

*   **Asthma Prevention**: Research shows a correlation between a molecule produced by the microbiome in children susceptible to asthma and their disease susceptibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>. [[Gene editing and CRISPR technology | CRISPR]] could potentially turn down the production of this molecule to prevent asthma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>.
*   **Brain and Immune System Health**: The microbiome profoundly impacts brain health and the immune system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>. There's a relationship between brain inflammation, microbial activity, and immune system activity, which could contribute to diseases like Alzheimer's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>. As the genetics of these interactions are understood, [[Gene editing and CRISPR technology | CRISPR]] could potentially change genes in the microbiome to prevent or treat such conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:23">[00:47:23]</a>.

## Access, Equity, and the Future
[[Future implications and challenges of genetic modification | A significant concern]] is the potential for a "gene gap" where access to expensive [[Gene editing and CRISPR technology | CRISPR]] therapies creates a divide based on wealth, similar to the movie *Gattaca* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>. However, new technologies often start expensive and become more accessible over time, like personal computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:45">[00:32:45]</a>. Proponents believe that restricting development because only a few can initially afford it would hinder progress that could eventually benefit everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>.

### IVF and Embryo Selection (PGD)
[[Applications of artificial womb research | In vitro fertilization (IVF)]] is a prerequisite for germline editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>. IVF technology already allows for embryo selection, where embryos are screened for certain traits or to avoid disease-causing mutations (Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis - PGD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>. The key difference is that PGD merely selects existing embryos, while [[Gene editing and CRISPR technology | CRISPR]] can actively make changes to DNA that might be present in all embryos for a given couple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>. IVF processes, including egg retrieval, are already difficult, time-consuming, and expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>.

### The Role of Curiosity-Driven Science
The discovery of [[Gene editing and CRISPR technology | CRISPR]] highlights the importance of fundamental, curiosity-driven science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:49">[00:48:49]</a>. Breakthroughs often come from scientists simply wondering "how something works" and then investigating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:56">[00:48:56]</a>. Supporting such research is crucial for future innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:48">[00:49:48]</a>. Current curiosities include the connection between microbiomes and human health (brain, immune system) and improving targeted delivery of molecules into cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>.

> "Few technologies are inherently good or bad. What matters is how we use them. And when it comes to [[Gene editing and CRISPR technology | CRISPR]], the possibilities of this new technology good and bad are limited only by our imaginations. I firmly believe we can use it for the former and not the latter. But I'm also cognizant that this will require determination from us individually and collectively. As a species we have never done anything like this before. But then again we've never had the tools to do it. The power to control our species' genetic future is awesome and terrifying. deciding how to handle it may be the biggest challenge we have ever faced. I hope I believe that we're up to the task." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>

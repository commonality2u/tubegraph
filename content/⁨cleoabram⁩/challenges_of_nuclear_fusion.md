While [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion | nuclear fusion]] holds immense [[energy_potential_of_fusion | energy potential]] and could be a solution for [[fusion_as_a_solution_for_climate_change | climate change]], there are significant [[challenges_of_creating_commercial_nuclear_fusion_energy | challenges]] to achieving commercially viable fusion power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## The Net Energy Problem
The primary hurdle is the inability to produce more electricity from a [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion | fusion]] reaction than is required to initiate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Researchers can currently achieve [[nuclear_fusion_basics | nuclear fusion]] by smashing atoms together to create larger ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, but this process still consumes more energy than it yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, which is counter to the purpose of an energy source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

## Confinement and Pressure Challenges
To make [[fusion_reactors_and_techniques | fusion]] happen at scale, plasma must be confined and pressurized for a sufficient duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Plasma is a state of matter where atoms have broken into bits, with neutrons, electrons, and protons flying around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. No known material can contain plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

On Earth, scientists attempt to achieve confinement using methods other than the sun's gravitational confinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>:
*   **Magnetic Confinement**: This method uses electronics and magnetic fields to pull plasma in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Machines like tokamaks are used to heat confined plasma until it fuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Inertial Confinement**: This approach rapidly compresses fusion fuel, often by shooting lasers at the plasma, causing it to fuse in billionths of a second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

Some companies, like Helion, are exploring hybrid methods such as magnetoinertial confinement, combining aspects of both magnetic and inertial confinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

## Material Scarcity and Controversy
The materials required for [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion | fusion]] are not standard hydrogen and helium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. While they do not pose the same nuclear proliferation concerns as fission materials, some are rare and difficult to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   The two most commonly used types of hydrogen in [[nuclear_fusion_basics | fusion]] are deuterium and tritium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. Tritium is rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
*   If tritium is unavailable, Helium-3, another rare form of helium, can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
There is ongoing debate within the [[challenges_and_future_of_particle_physics_research | fusion]] community regarding the best materials for achieving scalable [[fusion_reactors and techniques | fusion]] for widespread use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

## Historical Context and Cynicism
The idea of [[nuclear_fusion_basics | nuclear fusion]] providing cheap, clean, and inexhaustible energy has been discussed for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, leading to cynicism about its viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Despite headlines suggesting it's "decades away" or an "empty promise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>, proponents argue that the development timeline is comparable to other transformative technologies. For example, the understanding of electricity as an energy carrier emerged in the late 1600s, but it took until the 1800s to figure out how to use it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. This longer timeline for electricity development suggests that [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_nuclear_energy | fusion]] research, though lengthy, is not unprecedented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

## Distinction from Small-Scale Fusors
It's important to note the [[comparison_between_smallscale_fusors_and_commercial_fusion_reactors | difference between building a small-scale fusion system]] and developing a commercial reactor. It is "very, very easy" to build a small fusion system that creates a high-energy beam for fusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, as demonstrated by reports of teenagers achieving fusion in a garage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. However, this is distinct from achieving net energy gain required for power generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

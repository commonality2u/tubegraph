It is a common observation that dogs live much shorter lives than humans, which can feel unfair or even cruel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The average lifespan of a dog is significantly less than that of a human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## [[debunking_the_seven_dog_years_myth | Debunking the Seven Dog Years Myth]]

A popular belief suggests that one human year equals seven dog years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. According to this myth, a 2-year-old dog would be a "14-year-old teenager," and a 10-year-old dog would be a "70-year-old distinguished gentleman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. However, veterinarians refer to this as "the myth that never dies," stating it is not based on any [[scientific_research_on_canine_and_human_aging | scientific research]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. It likely originated from the rough observation that humans live to about 70 and dogs to about 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

Instead, a more [[scientific_research_on_canine_and_human_aging | scientific]] method for comparing dog and human ages has been developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This method, based on [[scientific_research_on_canine_and_human_aging | research]] by geneticists at UC San Diego, reveals a non-linear relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Dogs as a species age faster than humans when they are young, but slower when they are old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. For example, a 1-year-old dog is roughly equivalent to a 30-year-old person, not 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, while a 14-year-old dog is about 70 in human years, not 98 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Quantifying Aging and [[scientific_research_on_canine_and_human_aging | Scientific Research]]

The process of aging is complex, but [[scientific_research_on_canine_and_human_aging | current understanding]] suggests it involves an accumulation of various types of cellular damage over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This damage is thought to lead to the diseases commonly associated with old age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

One way to measure this aging process is by observing changes in DNA, specifically a phenomenon called "methylation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Methylation involves modifications to DNA that change its shape, and these modifications are thought to change predictably with age, serving as an "aging clock" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

The [[scientific_research_on_canine_and_human_aging | research]] that developed the new age comparison chart used DNA samples from Labradors collected over 16 years, comparing them to human DNA samples from individuals aged 1 to 103 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This helps to understand the underlying biological changes that occur with age, beyond visible signs like thinning hair or wrinkles, and more importantly, the onset of frailty, cancer, and other diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

Companies like Loyal, founded by Celine Halioua, are focused on developing a comprehensive quantified aging process to better understand and potentially slow aging in dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## [[the_impact_of_dog_breed_size_on_longevity | The Impact of Dog Breed Size on Longevity]]

A significant factor influencing a dog's lifespan is its breed size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. There is a stark difference in lifespans across dog breeds, with some variations being twofold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. For example, a Great Dane might live only 6-8 years, while a Chihuahua can live for 18 years or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

Generally, larger dog breeds tend to have shorter lifespans than smaller ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This strong correlation is largely attributed to human selective breeding practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Humans accidentally selectively bred for genetics that caused growth issues in larger dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

While dogs are born at very similar sizes, larger breeds grow metabolically at a much faster rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. It is theorized that the biological mechanisms that cause rapid growth in large dogs when they are puppies do not fully "turn off" or function correctly once the dog is fully grown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This continued metabolic activity causes them to age at a faster rate and consequently die sooner on average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

[[scientific_research_on_canine_and_human_aging | Research]] is focused on understanding these differences between dog breeds, particularly how small dogs might "hold the secret" to longer doggy life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. The goal is to make the metabolism of a big dog more akin to that of a small dog, potentially extending their lifespans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## [[advancements_in_antiaging_research_for_dogs | Advancements in Antiaging Research for Dogs]]

There is ongoing [[scientific_research_on_canine_and_human_aging | anti-aging research]] for both people and dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Loyal, for instance, is actively working on identifying specific areas and drugs to target the aging process in dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. While there isn't an anti-aging pill currently available for dogs, this [[scientific_research_on_canine_and_human_aging | research]] aims to bring forth drugs that help dogs live longer, healthier lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. This [[scientific_research_on_canine_and_human_aging | research]] into canine aging could also provide valuable insights that might one day help humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

Despite the current lack of a definitive anti-aging solution, there are steps owners can take to help their dogs live the longest possible lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The time spent with dogs is considered precious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, and [[advancements_in_antiaging_research_for_dogs | scientific progress]] holds the vision for extending this shared time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

## Introduction to Fusion Devices

[[Nuclear fusion basics | Nuclear fusion]] involves forcing two particles together at very high energies to fuse and form a heavier particle, releasing energy in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This process requires high energies, typically achieved using high voltage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

All [[fusion_reactors_and_techniques | fusion devices]] require a vacuum chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The type of vacuum chamber can vary; for example, stellarator-type [[fusion_reactors_and_techniques | fusion]] devices have a twisty-turny chamber, Helion's devices are cylindrical, and tokamaks have a D-shaped, donut-like cross-section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Small-Scale Fusors: The Farnsworth Fusor

A Farnsworth fusor is a very compact, small device designed to achieve some amount of [[nuclear_fusion_basics | fusion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. It is not built for commercial scale electricity generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### Method of Confinement
The Farnsworth fusor uses [[electrostatic_inertial_confinement_in_fusion_devices | electrostatic inertial confinement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. In this spherical setup, ions stream in from all angles to a central core, where they collide and fuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This contrasts with gravitational confinement (like in the Sun), magnetic confinement (using magnets), or inertial confinement (using lasers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Fusion Fuel
A common fuel for a fusor is deuterium, which consists of a neutron and a proton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. When two deuteriums fuse, they form helium-4 (two protons and two neutrons), releasing heat energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Energy Output
While each [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion | fusion]] reaction in a fusor produces significantly more [[energy_potential_of_fusion | energy]] than it took to fuse the particles, fusors face the [[challenges_of_nuclear_fusion | challenge]] of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. They cannot produce enough fusion to counteract all the [[energy_potential_of_fusion | energy]] spent on the electronics to make the process happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Therefore, while fusion *can* be achieved, it's difficult to get more total electricity out of the system than was put in to operate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Observing Fusion
The plasma created during fusion in a fusor appears as a pinkish-fuchsia color due to the combination of blue and bright red photons emitted by the deuterium plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. The presence of fusion is inferred by observing the hot, energetic particles colliding within the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## Commercial Nuclear Fusion Reactors

Commercial electricity systems based on [[nuclear_fusion_basics | nuclear fusion]] are significantly larger and more complex than small-scale fusors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

### Goal and Progress
The primary goal of commercial [[fusion_reactors_and_techniques | fusion reactors]] is to generate electricity that people can use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The rate of technological progress in [[fusion_reactors_and_techniques | fusion]] is such that private companies and governments are now building systems capable of commercial levels of [[basics_of_nuclear_fusion | fusion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. The aim is to get these systems on the grid as fast as possible, with the belief that [[fusion_as_a_solution_for_climate_change | fusion electricity]] could be available on the grid within our lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

### Key [[Challenges of creating commercial nuclear fusion energy | Challenges]]
The main [[challenges_of_creating_commercial_nuclear_fusion_energy | challenge]] for commercial [[fusion_reactors_and_techniques | fusion]] is not the atomic reaction itself, which yields enormous [[energy_potential_of_fusion | energy]], but rather creating a system that produces more total electricity than it consumes to operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. This involves maintaining the right temperature for a sufficient duration to ensure a net energy gain from the [[fusion_reactors_and_techniques | fusion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

## Safety Considerations

When working with [[fusion_reactors_and_techniques | fusion devices]], especially those involving high voltage, safety is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Essential safety rules include not touching components with two hands and keeping body parts away from dangerous areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.Okay, ready?
Today we're going to take the stuff that's in those boxes and we're going to
How do you introduce yourself?
I don't know! "Person who makes things and has a lot of tools
and a place we can mess up?"
And this is David. Davis is the reason we can actually do this because Simone and I
don't know what we're doing here...
Talk about yourself!
David runs a real kind of nuclear fusion
they're building massive devices that could in the future create electricity that people could actually use
Well, today we're going to be building a fusor
which is not commercial scale, it's much smaller, but if we're successful, we'll be
able to build this system today, get it running and do fusion...
In my backyard!
we're taking two particles and at a very high energies we're forcing them
together where they fuse and form a heavier particle but that takes high
energies to do. So we'll be using high voltage today, so it's important we talk
about how we safely approach high voltage to make sure that we can do this safely.
Is it okay that I have metal plates in my head?
First rule is don't touch it with two hands, second rule is don't put your head in it.
I just won't touch it with my head, I think I can avoid that yeah...
The fun thing about this, the wrinkle in all of this is David - he's not allowed to touch anything so
David No Hands is going to instruct us on how to build a fusion device.
I feel like this mostly has to do with our ego and no practical...
Yeah! We're gonna build it we just need David to tell us how...
He's the brain, we're the hands.
Yes I like that...
So now what is that we're gonna take that chamber and we're gonna
rotate the turbo pump...
Okay how does that look?
I think it looks great but I also don't know what I'm doing.
At this point we should put on gloves.
What is this device called? George.
We're building a Farnsworth fusor, it's a
very compact small device to do some amount of fusion. You're building a
vacuum chamber, all fusion devices have these - a stellarator-type fusion has a
really twisty turny one. Helion's devices are cylindrical. A tokamak has a more of
a donut, it's got a d-shaped cross section...
So I know that in order to do fusion, we're confining plasma and I know
that the sun does this with gravity "gravitational confinement" and then two sort
of broad categories of how humans do this are "magnetic confinement" and
"inertial confinement." Magnetic confinement uses magnets to confine plasma and one kind of inertial
confinement is using lasers to push the plasma close together and then things
fuse. So my question is: What method is this device using?
This one uses something called "electrostatic inertial confinement." In this case, we're going to
take two deuteriums, which is a neutron and a proton, and they fuse together to
form helium-4 which has two protons and two neutrons, this bigger molecule that
then is really hot and that's how we take the energy out of that particle. We
do it in a spherical way where the ions stream in from all angles to a center
core and as they collide, they fuse and each of those fusion reactions will
produce tremendously more energy than it took to actually fuse them together. The
channel challenge with that is that in a particle accelerator you only take one
or packet of a couple hundred and so yes you can make fusion, but you can't make
enough to counteract all the energy you spent on the electronics to make that thing happen.
So just to repeat this back to you, the challenge that we're having
with fusion right now we can get an enormous amount of energy out of the
actual react- the atomic reaction but we are having trouble getting more total
electricity out of the system that we create to do it in the first place. That's right.
Awesome, okay I understand the problem.
This is deuterium!
We are just pros at this, we just... well I shouldn't say that...
Let's be humble for a little bit longer, I'll let you know when we can stop being humble.
Like what are we gonna do next time we hang out to top this?
Are you gonna be disappointed if next time I come over we just have coffee?
How do we know when fusion is happening in the middle? Like what are we looking for at that moment?
Yeah so what we're looking for is a couple of things:
Mostly what we do is, we know how hot it is, we know how much energy all those
particles have and they come together they collide and so we know that they
must be doing fusion.
Why is it pink?
The color that you see is actually not pink at all, it's totally not pink
It looks pink, it's blue and red at the same time.
There's a blue photon and a bright red photon and when your eye sees those two
photons together it looks like that pink color, you get that fuchsia color that is
that the deuterium plasma being made. Dope!
Are these are all good sounds?
These are all good sounds! All good. Now what?
So now we're going to plug in that roughing pump... [WHIRRRRRRRR] Ah! Good?
Yep that's good.
So the next step is you can open that and it'll suck the air out of the two pumps [GROWWWWWWLLLLLL]
Now you can open that, it looks like it's a little open already [HISSSSS GRRRRRRRR]
Ah! So there you go, it actually tightens those you can see that it's starting to
come down a lot faster... so that was probably leaking a little bit.
Alright, so now we have pumped all of the air out right?
Yeah we're ready we can hook up the fusion fuel and the fusion power supplies
and start to do fusion.
Yeah? Awesome. Let's do it. What's the first step? Fusion fuel!
Got my fusion fuel here, I'll show you - OH!
Why did the sound change? [WHEEEEEEEEEEEE]
We lost a breaker! Here let me turn the breaker back on [POP!! HISSSSSS]
That was a bad sound! We popped the fuse on that...
and then that shut all the power down and then it started leaking air in. We're gonna let it come back down...
Unplug everything and plug it in straight there...
We popped a fuse so the air that we sucked out of the chamber where we want
to do the fusion all rush back in and you can't do fusion with a bunch of air
molecules in there so we've shut everything down, we rerouted the pumps
and we vacuumed the air back out again.
I'm so scared of it or I feel like I'm like all skittish and I'm like ready to bounce
Now what we're going to do is we're going to start introducing the
fuel into the chamber. We're just going to turn it slowly so we get to use to
what it's going to sound like...
I did those!
Rock Paper Scissors Shoot...
That's it okay, open slowly
And you can close it and then it should... now it's pumping the
gas back out... so a lot of a lot of fusion is listening to the machine.
Next we need to get out the power supply...
Now begins the Do Not Die section.
But as soon as the plasma starts, it'll start to flow current. So there's enough
voltage to start the plasma but then once it starts going we keep the current
low so it doesn't have too much.
Okay we're gonna test this right now. High voltage is on! Ready? We're at 1000 volts...
There's 2000 volts... 3000 volts... 4000 volts...
6000 volts... okay open really slowly really slowly One hand...
I heard something!
Slower than that! Still but really slow...
My heart is beading so fast... AHHHHHH!!!!!!
IS SOMETHING HAPPENING??? IT'S HAPPENING!!!!
It's all sci-fi stuff!!
Okay now close it...
Close it? To the right okay to the right...
[GASP] Am I in the way?? [GAAAASP]
Oh now it died. What happened? Why did it die?
So we went all the way up in pressure to where there was enough
particles to make a plasma and then just to show it we then came all the way back down...
Why didn't we stay????
So you're gonna have to get more fine on your gas control... Okay!
Like really fine! High voltage on. Gas, just a little bit of gas, really slow...
It's coming up... it's lit, now turn to the right
slow it down, real slow.. AAAHHHHWWWWAAAHHHH
Oh my god Cleo, you gotta look at this thing
it looks unlike anything I've ever seen!!
Turn to the right, slow, oh you're dialing really...
Switch the gauge around and then I would adjust the gas pressure.
So the problem that we were having before was that I was too clammy hands on
the gauge there so I was causing it to sort of jump around and not have
the right amount of all of the things it needed for the right amount of time.
We've swapped some things around to make it easier to control now and we're gonna
try it again. Cecause the key is we have to get it up to the right temperature
for long enough to know that we actually did fusion.
This valve's harder than, yeah [VALIDATION] GASP-AHHHH!!!
Wait it was there, it was there!
It's gone now... SQUEEEEEEAAAAL!!!!
Nice core on the jet, a single jet with a single pinch, and so what you're really
seeing here is the ions those charged particles that are flowing around that
haze are getting focused in and blasting in, it's not actually coming out it's
going in. Those ions are coming in to the core and as they come through and they
hit things, they ionize and form more plasma.
There's two kind of like pinch points on the beam... like there's another thinner point
Oh wow wow this is pretty awesome.
It is pretty awesome.
So at this point we're now at the right densities and pressures and voltage so we should be
creating fusion right now.
Is it? Is it happening?
It's happening right now.
Oh my god...
And probably in those pinch points and a little bit in the core too.
What's happening as it evolves?
So now it's starting to run out of gas, there's not enough ions around
to actually drag in and collide with the gas...
This is amazing. Oh my God.
And eventually the gas will decay enough that there won't be enough to even
sustain a plasma at all... so right now we have a core and this like tiny little jet...
I wonder if like two generations down this is going to be the equivalent of like watching your
like washing machine go, where you're like "oh my god that's so cool"
Hot tip: If your friend's ever like, "hey can we do fusion in your garage?" Say yes!
Be the crazy friend that says yes.
Be the even crazier friend that asks.
Wait so now can we say we did fusion?
Yes you can say that. YESS!!!!!!
WE DID FUSION!!!!!
At that accelerating voltage, pure deuterium, at this pressure, there was fusion.
In my workshop!!
We did fusion in Simone's workshop...
Holy [Bleepedy bleep bleep]
What the fusion.
So we've done all of this, we've built this device, we've done fusion in
Simone's workshop, like how should people understand what we did here in
comparison to what companies like yours and government projects are trying to do
with nuclear fusion and like how this might get them electricity sometime in the future?
It's a great question. So we built a fusor today but this is not a
commercial electricity system. Commercial electricity systems are going
to be larger, they're going to be more complex but what we are seeing is that
the rate of progress of the technology as such that now private companies
governments are now building systems that do commercial levels of fusion
already and so now it's a matter of us building systems and getting them on the
grid as fast as possible. What I believe and Helion believes is that we are close
enough to start thinking about having electricity on the grid from fusion in
our lifetimes and I want it much sooner than that.
Huge if true!
Thanks Simone for lending us your workshop, thank you for coming, thank you to the team at Helion -

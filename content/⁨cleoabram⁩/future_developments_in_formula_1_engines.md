Formula 1 engines are constantly evolving, with significant changes planned for the near future, impacting how teams design and compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

## 2026 Engine Regulations

New regulations for Formula 1 engines are set to be introduced in 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. These rules dictate that the engines will:
*   Use less fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
*   Incorporate more electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
*   Produce a slightly different sound compared to current engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.
*   These changes highlight the ongoing [[technological_innovations_in_electric_racing | technological innovations in electric racing]] within the sport, pushing for greater efficiency and sustainability.

## Red Bull's New Engine Facility

Red Bull, the current dominant team in [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]], is making a strategic shift in preparation for these new regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

Previously, Red Bull purchased engines for their cars from Honda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. However, for 2026, their cars will utilize custom-built engines developed in their own state-of-the-art facility in England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. This advanced engine development facility was constructed only two years prior to 2024, indicating the speed of its establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

### Importance of In-House Engine Development
Building an engine in-house offers significant advantages:
*   **Control and Integration** The primary reason is control and the paramount tie-in between the chassis and the engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Better integration between the engine and the car's [[engineering_and_design_of_formula_1_cars | aerodynamics]] is considered the way to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.
*   **Performance Advantage** Red Bull's substantial investment in time and money into a custom engine is a strategic bet to achieve a little more speed and control, ultimately aiming to win more races <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. The goal for any Formula 1 engine is to achieve maximum power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

### Engine Testing and Evolution
Engine development involves extensive testing. The new engines are run through automated power curves, with measurements taken at every speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. These tests are conducted at wide-open throttle, utilizing the engine's full capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.

The development of these engines demonstrates how [[engineering_and_technology_in_formula_1 | Formula 1 technology]], though not always entirely new, is refined and perfected by hundreds of skilled individuals and significant investment, inspiring improvements in general car technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.

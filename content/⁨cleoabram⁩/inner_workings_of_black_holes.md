Imagine being dragged towards a dark abyss where reality changes, and time warps, feeling a strange sensation of being stretched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This is the experience of falling into a [[Black Holes and Their Impact on Understanding Space and Time | black hole]], one of the most astonishing places in our universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Some black holes are so massive they could fit over 60 of our solar systems across them, with masses up to 100 billion times that of our sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Once you fall past a certain point, nothing can escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## What is a Black Hole?

A [[Black Holes and Their Impact on Understanding Space and Time | black hole]] forms when a massive star collapses, squashing its mass into an incredibly tiny space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. For example, if our sun were squashed to a radius of 3 kilometers, the gravity at its surface would be so immense that the escape velocity would exceed the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This means even light rays emitted from its surface would be trapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Thus, a black hole is a spot so massive with gravity so strong that not even light can escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

Initially, [[History and Discovery of Black Holes | black holes]] were considered a "mathematical quirk" or a theoretical solution to [[Einsteins theory of relativity and black holes | Einstein's equations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. However, scientists later discovered them by observing the warped movement of stars, galaxies, and gases around seemingly empty patches of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. These "empty patches" are the remnants of collapsing stars much larger than our sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. It's estimated that there are up to 40 quintillion black holes in our universe, and almost every galaxy, including our own Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Accretion Discs

One way scientists find [[Black Holes and Their Impact on Understanding Space and Time | black holes]] is by spotting their glowing accretion discs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This light does not come from the black hole itself, as black holes trap light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Instead, it comes from material spiraling violently in orbit around the dense object, heating up and emitting light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Due to the black hole's immense gravity, light from the accretion disc can be bent and distorted, appearing from in front of and behind the black hole even when viewed from the side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Sizes of Black Holes

[[Black Holes and Their Impact on Understanding Space and Time | Black holes]] vary greatly in size:
*   **Sagittarius A***: The black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy, it has a mass 4.3 million times that of our sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. If placed in our solar system, it would extend to about 1/5 of Mercury's average orbit, making it "shockingly small for its immense mass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **J1650**: One of the smallest discovered, its diameter is only about as long as Manhattan, but it has a mass of 3.8 times our sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Messier 15**: About twice the diameter of Earth with a mass of 4,000 suns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This marks the lower limit of what is considered a supermassive black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **M87**: Weighs 5.4 billion suns, large enough to fit our solar system around 4 times across it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. This was the first black hole ever photographed in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Ton 618**: One of the largest discovered, weighing 66 billion times more than our sun, capable of fitting nearly 40 of our solar systems across it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Phoenix A**: Potentially the largest, with a mass of 100 billion suns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## The Journey into a Black Hole

If you were falling into a [[Black Holes and Their Impact on Understanding Space and Time | black hole]] in free fall, like astronauts on the International Space Station, you wouldn't feel anything initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Even if you passed through the accretion disc, a magically insulated spacecraft would feel nothing from the radiation and heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

### The Observer's View vs. The In-Faller's View

The experience of falling into a [[Black Holes and Their Impact on Understanding Space and Time | black hole]] is profoundly different depending on whether you are falling in or observing from afar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. This is because [[Black Holes and Their Impact on Understanding Space and Time | black holes]] distort spacetime near them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. [[Einsteins theory of relativity and black holes | Albert Einstein]] realized that space and time are actually one stretchy entity called spacetime, which warps or curves in response to matter and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. A [[Black Holes and Their Impact on Understanding Space and Time | black hole]] represents the most extreme example of this distortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

*   **From an Outside Observer (You)**: As you watch someone fall towards the black hole, their time would appear to tick more and more slowly until it stops on the [[The Concept of Event Horizons and Spaghettification | event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. You would never actually see them cross the [[The Concept of Event Horizons and Spaghettification | event horizon]]; from your perspective, nothing ever goes into the black hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. The light from the falling object would appear redder and redder, becoming infinitely redshifted as it struggles to escape the gravitational field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **From the In-Faller's Perspective (Us)**: We would not feel anything unusual as we cross the [[The Concept of Event Horizons and Spaghettification | event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. The [[The Concept of Event Horizons and Spaghettification | event horizon]] can be imagined as a "river of space" flowing inwards at the speed of light, and faster than light inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Once past this point, there's no turning back, similar to a fish swimming against a tide faster than it can swim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

### Spaghettification and the Singularity

Once past the [[The Concept of Event Horizons and Spaghettification | event horizon]], gravity increases at an accelerating rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. This leads to a dramatic stretching and squashing sensation known as [[Spaghettification and tidal forces near black holes | spaghettification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This occurs because the distortion in spacetime is not constant over the length of your body, meaning gravity at your feet is vastly different from that at your head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. As you get closer to the singularity, these effects become so extreme that your body first ceases to stay together, then atoms separate, followed by protons and quarks, until "everything's been ripped apart!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

All the ripped-apart pieces race inward toward the singularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. The singularity is not just an infinitely dense point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>; because a [[Black Holes and Their Impact on Understanding Space and Time | black hole]] is a distortion of spacetime, the singularity is also "a moment in time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. It's the "end of time" in [[Einsteins theory of relativity and black holes | Einstein's theory]], behaving like an unavoidable future for anything that crosses the [[The Concept of Event Horizons and Spaghettification | event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

## The Information Paradox and Future Research

According to [[Einsteins theory of relativity and black holes | Einstein's theory]], once you've been [[Spaghettification and tidal forces near black holes | spaghettified]] and reached the singularity, there's no way out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. However, [[Hawking Radiation and Information Paradox | Stephen Hawking]] famously stated that "[[Hawking radiation and black hole evaporation | black holes ain't so black]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. He discovered that [[Black Holes and Their Impact on Understanding Space and Time | black holes]] emit what's called [[Hawking radiation and black hole evaporation | Hawking radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. This radiation means they lose energy, have a finite lifetime, and will eventually evaporate, leaving behind only the emitted [[Hawking radiation and black hole evaporation | Hawking radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

### The Information Paradox

The existence of [[Hawking radiation and black hole evaporation | Hawking radiation]] led to the [[Hawking Radiation and Information Paradox | information paradox]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. The initial calculation suggested that [[Hawking radiation and black hole evaporation | Hawking radiation]] was "information free" and purely thermal, implying that any record of what fell into the [[Black Holes and Their Impact on Understanding Space and Time | black hole]] would be erased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. This contradicted a fundamental law of the universe: information is conserved and does not get destroyed, only scrambled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

### Latest Insights

Recent research, particularly a series of papers published in 2019, suggests that [[Hawking Radiation and Information Paradox | Stephen Hawking]] "missed a bit in his calculation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. These papers indicate that the [[Hawking radiation and black hole evaporation | radiation]] is *not* information-free; instead, all the information about everything that fell in is imprinted in the radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

This resolution, while consistent with information conservation, introduces a new puzzle: how does information that went to the singularity (the end of time) get outside again as radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>? This is a topic of [[The information paradox and the future of black hole research | ongoing research]] with no agreed-upon picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. Some speculative ideas include:
*   The interior of the [[Black Holes and Their Impact on Understanding Space and Time | black hole]] being, in some sense, the same place as the exterior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.
*   The opening of "wormholes" from the interior to the exterior, allowing bits of information to pass through and emerge in the [[Hawking radiation and black hole evaporation | Hawking radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.
*   The possibility that one never truly "goes in," or that there is no "in" of a [[Black Holes and Their Impact on Understanding Space and Time | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
*   The concept that everything is just information with no real place, hinting at a description of the universe as a "giant quantum computer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

This area of study is considered "cutting-edge stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>, directly addressing the fundamental nature of space and time themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. [[Black Holes and Their Impact on Understanding Space and Time | Black holes]] are an incredible gift to physics because they stretch the limits of our understanding of the universe, revealing the hidden structure of reality that governs everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. By studying these extreme objects, scientists gain insight into concepts like quantum computers and quantum information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

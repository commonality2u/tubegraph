From: [[⁨cleoabram⁩]] <br/> 

Nuclear fusion is being explored as a potential solution to global energy needs, particularly in the face of climate change, due to its promise of clean, inexhaustible, and abundant energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.

## Understanding Nuclear Fusion

[[nuclear_fusion_basics | Nuclear fusion]] involves smashing tiny atoms, such such as hydrogen or helium, together to create a larger atom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>, a process that releases a significant amount of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. This differs from nuclear fission, which involves cracking a large atom, like uranium, into smaller atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

While uncontrolled [[nuclear_fusion_basics | fusion]] can be used to make a hydrogen bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>, controlled [[nuclear_fusion_basics | fusion]] is the focus for energy generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. Researchers can currently achieve [[nuclear_fusion_basics | nuclear fusion]] by smashing atoms together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

## The Urgency and Potential of Fusion Energy

The threat of climate change and the urgent need for more clean energy sources are driving increased focus on [[nuclear_fusion_basics | fusion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. [[energy_potential_of_fusion | Fusion]] offers millions of times more energy for the same amount of mass compared to fossil fuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. While fission has a similar energy density, [[nuclear_fusion_basics | fusion]] comes with fewer safety risks, particularly regarding nuclear proliferation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. A [[nuclear_fusion_basics | fusion]] bomb is still considered a fission bomb, as it contains uranium and plutonium, meaning [[nuclear_fusion_basics | fusion]] by itself is not a proliferation concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

The societal impact of potentially very cheap and abundant energy from [[nuclear_fusion_basics | fusion]] could be profound, changing how humanity approaches resource consumption and suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>.

## [[challenges_of_nuclear_fusion | Challenges of Nuclear Fusion]]

Despite its promise, the primary [[challenges_of_nuclear_fusion | challenge of nuclear fusion]] is the inability to get more electricity out of the reaction than is put in to make it happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>. To achieve [[nuclear_fusion_basics | fusion]] at scale, it's necessary to combine atoms continuously, rather than just smashing individual ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. This requires containing and pressurizing plasma—a state of matter where atoms have broken into their constituent bits (neutrons, electrons, protons) due to high energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.

### Methods of Plasma Confinement
Three main methods are known to confine plasma enough for [[nuclear_fusion_basics | fusion]] to happen at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>:

*   **Gravitational Confinement**: This is how the sun works, using immense gravity to pull plasma in, compress, and heat it until fusion occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>. This method is not feasible on Earth due to the inability to build systems large enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>.
*   **Magnetic Confinement**: This method uses electronics and magnetic fields to pull plasma in and hold it in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>. A common machine used for this is a tokamak, which heats the plasma as it circles around until it fuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>.
*   **Inertial Confinement**: Instead of steadily holding fusion fuel, this approach compresses it very quickly, on the order of a billionth of a second, typically by shooting lasers at the plasma to push it together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. This results in brief "plasma blinks" rather than a continuous "plasma soup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>.
*   **Magnetoinertial Confinement**: Some companies, like Helion, combine elements of both magnetic and inertial confinement. This allows for sustained confinement like magnetic methods, with added rapid compression like inertial methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>.

### Material Scarcity
Another [[challenges_of_creating_commercial_nuclear_fusion_energy | challenge of creating commercial nuclear fusion energy]] involves the specific materials needed. The two most commonly used types of hydrogen for [[nuclear_fusion_basics | fusion]] are deuterium and tritium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>. Tritium is rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>. While helium-3 can also be used, it is also rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>. There is ongoing debate within the [[nuclear_fusion_basics | fusion]] community about the best materials to use for scaling up to meet the needs of millions of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.

## Optimism for the Future

Despite the [[challenges_of_nuclear_fusion | challenges of nuclear fusion]], the long development timeline is not unprecedented. The understanding of electricity as an energy carrier emerged in the late 1600s, but it took until the 1800s to figure out how to use it, a period longer than the time spent working on [[nuclear_fusion_basics | fusion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>. Many people once dismissed electricity as a "useless pipedream" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>.

The stakes for getting [[nuclear_fusion_basics | fusion]] right are high, with a real need to focus on climate change and the potential for [[nuclear_fusion_basics | fusion]] to be the answer to energy needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>. Investing more in [[nuclear_fusion_basics | fusion]] research is seen as a crucial step towards making this dream a reality and reducing human suffering through accessible, abundant energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>.

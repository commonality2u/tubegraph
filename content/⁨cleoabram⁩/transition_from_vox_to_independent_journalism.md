A video journalist previously working with Vox has announced the launch of a new independent show titled "Let me explain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This new venture aims to offer "journalistically rigorous, genuinely optimistic explanations about technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, presenting a counter-narrative to often pessimistic media portrayals of the future, described as "like Black Mirror, but the opposite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Each episode will be a deep dive into an idea that "could change all of hour lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Background at Vox

The journalist identifies as a video journalist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, having worked for Vox for five years, primarily covering tech and economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Their work has been featured on Vox’s Netflix show *Explained*, Vox’s YouTube channel, and their own TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Rationale for Independent Path

The decision to go independent stems from a critical observation of current media trends and a desire to foster a more optimistic outlook regarding future possibilities.

### Critiquing Media Pessimism
Journalists often dismiss new ideas as "implausible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, partly because such stories are "easier to tell" and popular with readers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The journalist highlights a recurring pattern in how new ideas are discussed:
1.  "It’s not possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>
2.  "It’s too expensive, they can’t get the cost down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>
3.  "Do people really need that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>
4.  "Oh, it’s just a fad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>
5.  Followed by: "Oh my god, it changed the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>

An example cited is a 1903 newspaper article, published just two months before the Wright brothers' flight, declaring "Flying Machines Which Do Not Fly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> and estimating millions of years for successful flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Fostering Optimism and Guidance
The journalist questions what potentially beneficial developments are being missed due to this pessimistic pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. The new show aims to [[engagement_with_new_possibilities_in_journalism | rigorously engage with the possibility]] of positive change sooner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This approach is intended to:
*   Better guide new tools early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   Allow for collective "course correcting, together, before things go… off the rails" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   Counter widespread feelings of nihilism and fear, particularly among younger generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   Help people "imagine what could go right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, rather than solely focusing on challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

> [!quote] "I just think I have another responsibility also, to help people imagine what could go right." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>

The journalist acknowledges the journalist's role to be skeptical and point out challenges, but emphasizes an additional responsibility to inspire hope and action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## The New Show: "Let me explain"

### Format and Tone
Each episode will explore a single "big idea" and imagine its successful implementation:
*   "What does that world look like?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>
*   "What do we need to do to make sure it helps the most people?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>
*   "How does it compare to the status quo?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>
*   "What could go right?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>

The independent format allows for a more personal and experimental approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, with the journalist "grappling with these questions" and exploring topics in an "experimental way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. The show will be "scrappier" and represent a personal endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### Collaboration and Audience Engagement
The show will feature insights from "incredible experts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, including Matt Yglesias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, David Roberts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>, Dr. Tia Jackson-Bey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, Alexis Ohanian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, and Johnny Harris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, as well as family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

A key component of the new show is audience participation. The journalist explicitly encourages viewers to ask questions and suggest topics that cause pessimism or overwhelm them, promising to investigate and "find the best ways that we have to solve them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. While not promising solutions will work, the journalist assures they will focus on ideas that "will be huge if true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

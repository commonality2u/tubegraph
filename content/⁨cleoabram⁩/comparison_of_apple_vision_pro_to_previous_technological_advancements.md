The release of the [[the_potential_of_the_apple_vision_pro_in_augmented_reality | Apple Vision Pro]] has sparked considerable discussion, with many observers initially "tuning out the news about the metaverse" due to a lack of clear vision for the technology's purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Despite initial skepticism about its heavy design and mainstream appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, some see it as a significant step towards a more optimistic future for immersive technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## A Long-Standing Pursuit of Immersion

For decades, people have imagined "the metaverse" in science fiction and real life, with efforts to "jump into" computers or "bring digital stuff out into the real world" dating back as long as computers have existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The [[the_potential_of_the_apple_vision_pro_in_augmented_reality | Apple Vision Pro]] is positioned as the "next big step" in this long technological journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Historical Parallels and Future Potential

The core question surrounding the [[the_potential_of_the_apple_vision_pro_in_augmented_reality | Apple Vision Pro]] (V1) is what its "V10" — its ultimate potential — will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Historically, Apple products have "unlocked" new eras of computing:
*   **Apple Macintosh**: Helped unlock personal computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **iPhone**: Helped unlock computers in pockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

The most optimistic view for the [[the_potential_of_the_apple_vision_pro_in_augmented_reality | Apple Vision Pro]] is that it will unlock "digital teleportation" – the ability to instantaneously jump to any place, anytime, and bring other people with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This vision extends beyond mere infinite computer monitors or solo video games, aiming for an ability "physically impossible in the real world but maybe not in the digital one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## The Pursuit of "Realism" in Communication

Technological advancements have consistently strived for greater realism and presence in communication:
*   **Telegram**: A foundational step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Phone Call**: Offered concurrent time, a closer form of connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
*   **FaceTime/Video Calls**: Allowed seeing faces, making interactions feel more present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Hologram/Realistic Persona**: The ultimate goal, where a digital representation feels like truly "spending time with someone" due to realistic body language and eye contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

The [[the_potential_of_the_apple_vision_pro_in_augmented_reality | Apple Vision Pro]]'s key innovation in this pursuit is its intuitive interface, allowing users to control cursors with their eyes and finger pinches, making interactions feel "much more intuitive and sort of real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Its ability to render "rock solid objects" in 3D space, aided by an advanced sensor array and R1 chip, creates a highly convincing illusion of reality, even adding subtle shadows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### Immersive Examples
*   **Digital Objects**: The ability to place digital objects, like a Formula 1 car, into a physical room with "shockingly real" reflections and stable positioning, surpasses previous jiggling versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Spatial Video**: The new iPhones can capture "spatial video," allowing users to re-experience memories in 3D through the headset, making them feel "much more like memories" and allowing users to "teleport into them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Environments**: The device allows users to become fully immersed in 360-degree digital environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Future Storytelling**: This level of realism could revolutionize storytelling, allowing users to interact with digital elements like a [[technological_advancements_and_future_potential_of_robot_dogs | Boston Dynamics Atlas robot]] in person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_successes_in_technological_progress | Challenges and Successes in Technological Progress]]

While digital objects appear "pretty amazing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>, the current "Personas" (scanned avatars) of people in the Vision Pro are still evolving, sometimes looking like a "PS3 Avatar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. However, significant progress has been made in avatar realism in just a few years, with Meta's avatars also improving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. This rapid improvement contributes to the [[importance_of_optimistic_visions_for_future_innovation | importance of optimistic visions for future innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

The [[the_potential_of_the_apple_vision_pro_in_augmented_reality | Apple Vision Pro]] is a "first gen product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>, drawing comparisons to the first iPhone, which was a "bet on a new technology" that "literally changed humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. This suggests that the Vision Pro, despite its current $3,500 price tag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>, could have a "gigantic effect down the road on humans" and the way we interact with technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

## Hope for Greater Connection

A primary motivation for this technology is to combat increasing social isolation. Studies show that people spend more time alone over their lifetimes, with peak time with parents and friends occurring before age 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. The hope for V10 of this technology is that it makes "spending time with other people" less difficult and helps "make those charts look very very different in 50 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. The goal is a device that connects people more deeply, rather than isolating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. While nothing can yet truly replicate being in person, the entire history of telecommunications has been a continuous effort to get "how close can we get?" to that feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

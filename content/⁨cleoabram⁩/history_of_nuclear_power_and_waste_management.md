Nuclear power has a complex history, marked by early innovations, policy shifts, and ongoing debates about waste management. While many associate nuclear power with hazardous waste, early developments and modern understanding reveal a potential for [[the_potential_of_reusing_nuclear_waste_for_energy | reusing nuclear waste for energy]] that could transform the industry.

## Early Vision: Recycling Nuclear Waste
In 1962, a nuclear reactor developed by the Argonne National Laboratory demonstrated the ability to produce electricity using nuclear waste as fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. At the time, predictions suggested that by the year 2000, more than half of the United States' electric power would come from atomic sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This vision included the widespread use of [[nuclear_waste_recycling_technology | nuclear waste recycling technology]] to create a clean energy future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

However, this future has not materialized, as the United States currently does not reuse any of its nuclear waste; instead, it accumulates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Understanding Nuclear Power and Waste
Nuclear power plants generate electricity by heating a liquid into steam to spin a turbine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This heat comes from splitting atoms inside special rocks, primarily uranium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### The Nuclear Fuel Cycle
1.  **Uranium Enrichment**: Natural uranium contains less than one percent of "Uranium-235," the breakable isotope needed for a nuclear reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Uranium undergoes an "enrichment" process to increase the concentration of Uranium-235 from the less useful Uranium-238 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
2.  **Fuel Pellets and Rods**: The enriched fuel is formed into pellets, about the size of a finger up to the first joint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. These pellets are then placed into long metal rods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
3.  **Chain Reaction**: Neutrons are fired at Uranium-235, causing it to split into smaller, unstable atoms and release more neutrons, initiating a chain reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This process generates intense heat, which is used to boil water, spin turbines, and produce electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
4.  **Spent Fuel (Nuclear Waste)**: After four to six years, the special uranium in the fuel rods is sufficiently broken down that the reaction becomes inefficient, and the spent fuel is then considered high-level nuclear waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

### The Nuclear Waste Problem
This spent fuel is a mix of Uranium-238, leftover Uranium-235, and unstable atoms that emit ionizing radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. This radiation can be dangerous, affecting human tissues and DNA in potentially deadly ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. A significant concern is that this nuclear waste remains radioactive for incredibly long periods, sometimes hundreds of thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

Currently, most nuclear waste in the U.S. is stored in dry casks designed to last decades, not hundreds of thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. This "once-through" fuel cycle means uranium is used once and then stored indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

## The Potential of Recycling Nuclear Waste
Despite the challenges, the technology to recycle nuclear waste exists and has been demonstrated. Argonne National Laboratory is one of the few places in the U.S. still testing [[nuclear_waste_recycling_technology | nuclear waste recycling technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

### The Recycling Process
The recycling process involves:
1.  Cutting up nuclear waste into small pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
2.  Dissolving these pieces in a vat of molten salts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
3.  Running electricity through the vat to separate useful uranium and other materials from the waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
4.  Forming new fuel rods from the recovered materials for use in reactors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

This [[nuclear_waste_recycling_technology | nuclear waste recycling technology]] can be performed multiple times, not only generating more electricity but also dramatically reducing the time the waste remains radioactive—from hundreds of thousands of years down to hundreds of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

This represents a "closed" fuel cycle: uranium is mined, used in a reactor, useful materials are filtered out, and then reused multiple times before the remaining, much shorter-lived waste is stored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Estimates suggest that there is enough used fuel in the U.S. alone to power the country for the next 150 years if it were recycled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### [[global_perspectives_on_nuclear_fuel_recycling | Global Perspectives on Nuclear Fuel Recycling]]
Some countries, such as Japan, already implement nuclear waste recycling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. They do so to reduce dependence on imported fuel, conserve uranium, and decrease the radioactivity of their nuclear waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## Policy Shifts and [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_nuclear_energy | Challenges and Opportunities in Nuclear Energy]]
The trajectory of nuclear waste recycling in the U.S. changed dramatically in 1977 when President Jimmy Carter announced new policies to halt nuclear recycling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. This decision was driven by concerns over nuclear proliferation, specifically the highly radioactive element plutonium, which is separated during recycling and was considered a proliferation risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Carter believed a viable nuclear power program could exist without reprocessing and recycling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

Consequently, the U.S. shifted away from "fast reactors," which could handle nuclear waste, towards "light water reactors," which are common today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. While the U.S. stopped, other countries continued their recycling programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. President Reagan lifted the ban in 1981, recognizing that it wasn't effectively slowing nuclear proliferation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. However, by then, companies had already invested in reactors that couldn't recycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

Today, the main argument against [[nuclear_waste_recycling_technology | nuclear fuel recycling]] is its high cost compared to cheap and plentiful new uranium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. However, changing incentives, including concerns about global fuel supply and the urgent need for more clean energy, are reigniting interest in this abandoned technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

The technology for nuclear waste recycling is not a dream for the future but a proven concept that needs to be commercialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. If humanity can overcome its fears and apply ingenuity, reusing nuclear waste could be a significant step toward a better energy future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

Non-Fungible Tokens, commonly known as NFTs, are digital art assets that have achieved significant market value, with some selling for millions of dollars, including a $1.2 million US dollar sale, a $29 million dollar sale, and one reaching $69.3 million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This phenomenon prompts a central question: how can digital art become so valuable, especially when it can be easily copied or screenshotted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>?

## The Challenge of Digital Value

Initial explanations of NFTs often focus on the underlying [[role_of_blockchain_technology_in_nfts | blockchain technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. However, this technical explanation doesn't fully address *why* these digital assets command such high prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. To grasp the valuation of NFTs, it's necessary to understand the broader and often unusual ways art is valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## A Historical Precedent: The Scull Auction of 1973

The story of modern art valuation, and by extension NFTs, can be traced back to an event on October 18, 1973, in New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Robert and Ethel Scull, early collectors who deeply invested in living artists like Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, and Jasper Johns, hosted an auction at Sotheby's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This event was groundbreaking because it was the first time living artists' works sold for "many tens of millions of dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

Many people at the time criticized this commercialization of art, perceiving it as an uncomfortable fusion of art and money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Robert Rauschenberg, an artist whose work sold for $85,000 after he originally sold it for $900, even engaged in a fistfight at the auction due to his disbelief at the price and receiving none of the profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This moment is considered a turning point that "exploded art prices forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### The Rise of Celebrity Artists

A key factor in this shift was the emergence of living artists as celebrities, with [[impact_of_celebrity_culture_on_art_prices | Andy Warhol]] leading the way in the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. For Warhol, celebrity itself was his medium, and he became as famous as, if not more famous than, the celebrities he depicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. When art's value becomes tied more to the artist's personal celebrity or the conceptual ideas behind the art, rather than a physical object, it disconnects from traditional benchmarks of value like production cost, time spent, or aesthetic appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Instead, the question becomes: "How much is that idea worth?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This paradigm shift directly contributes to [[art_valuation_and_historical_context | art prices going consistently upward]] since that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Expanding Definitions of Art and Value

This explosion in art prices also broadened the definition of what constitutes art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Art can now include:
*   Text phrases displayed publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   A pile of candy that is slowly eaten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   A banana taped to a wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   Instructions for creating the art yourself, as seen in the wall drawings of Sol LeWitt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

Artists like Andy Warhol and Elaine Sturtevant deliberately played with notions of originality and authorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Warhol himself stated, "I think it would be great if more people took up silk screens so that no one would know whether my picture was mine or someone else's" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This highlights that for some conceptual art, the physical object is less important than the idea or the certificate of ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. For instance, with Sol LeWitt's wall drawings, the physical drawing is not the artwork; the artwork is the certificate, without which it holds no value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

This perspective reveals that art value is often tied to branding, concept, hype, ego, speculation, and investment, applying to nearly all forms of art, not just the "weird" ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. While money laundering and fraud do exist in the art world, dismissing high prices solely on this basis avoids the deeper question of *why* some individuals genuinely pay for the concept behind the art and the act of owning it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## NFTs: A New Frontier for Valuation

The fundamental difference between NFTs and previous forms of art is not *why* they have value, but *who decides* that value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. With NFTs, a new community of enthusiasts and investors now influences valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. The same critics who accepted a banana taped to a wall as art now dismiss NFTs as having no value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

NFTs became prominent because of a widespread agreement on a digital database that establishes ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This database utilizes [[role_of_blockchain_technology_in_nfts | blockchain technology]], but in theory, any widely accepted system (like one run by Sotheby's) could fulfill this role if enough people agreed to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. As Alexis Ohanian, founder of Reddit and an NFT collector, explains, "as long as there is a critical mass of people who believe in it, that is the only database that matters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. The idea that an NFT is "just a link to an image" means that the value lies in the agreed-upon credential of ownership within that database, much like the "certificate" for conceptual art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

## The Fluidity of Value

To illustrate the flexible nature of value, consider a thought experiment by the art collective MSCHF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. They purchased an Andy Warhol drawing for about $20,000, made 999 exact copies, mixed the original with the copies, and sold each for $250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Most people would likely pay more for the original, especially if it came with a certificate, driven by a desire for uniqueness or potential resale value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. This highlights that "value" is an incredibly flexible idea, even for those outside the traditional art world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

When people question the value of NFTs by saying "I can just screenshot that," they are echoing questions the art world has contemplated for decades: "What is value? Where does it come from? What is too much, for too little?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. NFTs push these questions to an extreme by involving vast sums of money, no physical product, and decentralized decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

Despite the discomfort these high prices may cause, NFTs should be viewed within the broader context of art itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. They represent a "new medium" and a "new canvas" for a generation of artists creating exclusively with digital platforms in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. In essence, NFTs reflect our evolving understanding of value in a digital age, making visible what was previously abstract in the art market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

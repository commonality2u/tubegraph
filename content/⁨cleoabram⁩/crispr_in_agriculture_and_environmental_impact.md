[[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | CRISPR]] technology, known for its ability to edit genes, is already being utilized in plants to grow new crops and in animals to create new species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This technology is considered a profound capability, ranging from modifying crops to be more resilient to drought or produce more yields, to impacting animals for environmental benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. The global impact of [[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | CRISPR]] is anticipated to be seen first in plant and animal manipulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:29">[00:38:29]</a>.

### Advances in Plant Breeding
In the plant world, [[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | CRISPR]] is leading to incredible advances, creating plants that were previously impossible to achieve through traditional breeding methods, which could take decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. [[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | CRISPR]] can increase crop yields and enhance their nutritional value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

Traditional plant breeding involves introducing random DNA changes using chemicals or radiation, then selecting and breeding plants with desirable traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>. This process is time-consuming and often results in coupled traits, where changing one desirable trait might inadvertently affect another, like thornless roses losing their smell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:38">[00:39:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:43">[00:39:43]</a>.

In contrast, [[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | CRISPR]] allows for targeted, precise changes that alter only one specific trait without affecting others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. Furthermore, [[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | CRISPR]] can simultaneously modify multiple genes (5, 10, or even 15 at a time) in plants, enabling sophisticated alterations safely and precisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>.

Examples of [[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | CRISPR]]-edited plants include:
*   A tomato approved in Japan, claimed to have higher nutritional value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>.
*   Non-browning mushrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>.
*   Higher-yielding tomato plants developed in US labs that retain their normal taste and appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>.

### Regulation and Future Outlook for Crops
In the United States, the Department of Agriculture has ruled that plant DNA changes made using [[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | CRISPR]] are not considered genetically modified (GMO) and are not regulated if the changes could have been achieved through traditional breeding over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:13">[00:42:13]</a>. This means [[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | CRISPR]]-edited crops are expected to appear in grocery stores in the not-too-distant future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>.

## Environmental Impact and Animal Applications

### Reducing Methane Emissions from Cattle
[[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | CRISPR]] is being explored to address significant environmental challenges, such as reducing methane emissions from cattle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, and cattle farming is a major contributor to global carbon emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>. Cattle produce methane primarily from microorganisms (the microbiome) in their gut, which also convert food into gas instead of milk or meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:21">[00:43:21]</a>.

Scientists are working to alter the metabolism of these methane-producing bacteria using [[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | CRISPR]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>. [[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | CRISPR]] can target specific genes in these bacteria to reduce methane production and enhance nutrient generation, benefiting both the animal and the farmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>. While altering cow diets can reduce methane, it is expensive and difficult to deploy globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>. The aspiration is to develop an easy-to-deploy method, such as a pill given once to calves, to sustainably edit their microbiome for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>. This approach focuses on editing the microorganisms within the cow, not the cow itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>.

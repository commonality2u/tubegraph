AI's capabilities are rapidly evolving, with significant advancements anticipated beyond image generation, promising to reshape various forms of media and raise crucial societal questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

## Expansion into New Media

Looking ahead, advancements in AI are expected to move beyond static images to encompass other media forms. Aditya Ramesh, who helped build DALL-E 2, expressed excitement about "moving beyond just images" to include "audio and video" generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

## The Imminent Arrival of Photorealism

While current AI-generated images may not always be perfectly photorealistic, Ramesh predicts that this will be "pretty much solved for images" within a matter of months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

## Societal Implications and Preparation

The arrival of photorealistic AI-generated content introduces a new realm of considerations, both positive and negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Concerns are already present regarding deepfakes and misinformation, highlighting the challenge of distinguishing between real and fake images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

While these [[technological_advances_enabling_ai_capabilities | AI tools]] represent a substantial leap forward and can foster [[the_creative_potential_unlocked_by_ai_tools | human creativity]], they require collaborative effort to refine their usage and address potential [[the_ethical_and_economic_implications_of_aigenerated_art | ethical and economic implications of AI-generated art]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. It is crucial for individuals to engage with these tools early and participate in the ongoing conversation about their responsible development and application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. These discussions are vital as [[future_of_ai_development_and_opensource_considerations | AI continues to develop]], becoming more inclusive and offering widespread access to powerful creative capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

Super shoes have become a central part of a significant [[debate_on_technology_in_sports | debate in sports]], prompting questions about when athletic gear becomes so advanced that it crosses into unfair advantage, or "tech doping" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Historical Context
Historically, running shoes have evolved significantly. Early running shoes resembled loafers with spikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Modern running shoes allow athletes to run much faster than earlier designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. However, the introduction of "super shoes," such as Nike's controversial Vaporfly line, sparked new controversy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Technology of Super Shoes
Modern super shoes, like the successors to the prototypes worn by Eliud Kipchoge, are the result of extensive [[technology_advancements_in_sports_tracking_and_data_collection | technological development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. They are designed with three key sections:
*   **The Upper**: Holds the foot securely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **The Outsole**: Makes contact with the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **The Midsole**: Crucially determines the energy return to the runner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

Nike's super shoes maximize energy return through several innovations:
*   **Taller Stack of Cushy Foam**: A new type of foam provides increased cushioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Carbon Fiber Plate**: Acts as a lever, springing the runner forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   **Special Air Pockets**: Included for extra bounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

Prior to super shoes, a good energy return rate was about 60-65%; with super shoes, this rate increased to around 80%, meaning more of the runner's energy is reused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. It is important to note that the energy still originates entirely from the runner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

## Impact on Performance and Records
The introduction of super shoes led to runners "crushing" world records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Marathon times, in particular, saw the biggest increase in 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

A notable example is Eliud Kipchoge, who in 2019 became the first person to run a marathon in under two hours (26.2 miles at 4 minutes and 35 seconds per mile) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. He wore special prototype super shoes that studies indicated helped runners go 2-3% faster than the next fastest shoe at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This performance raised concerns among regulators that the shoe threatened the integrity of the sport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## Regulation and Debate
Regulators responded to the rapid advancements by implementing specific rules for running shoes:
*   **Foam Height Limit**: A 40 mm foam height limit was imposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   **Carbon Fiber Plates**: Shoes are limited to one carbon fiber plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Availability Rule**: All shoes must be available for general purchase at least four months before being used in competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

These rules were largely aimed at Nike's innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Nike initially expressed dissatisfaction, stating that the rules would "stifle innovation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. However, Nike's head of sport research lab maintains a "moral obligation to keep pushing forward," emphasizing that their goal is to advance the human body's capabilities, not simply to provide external pushes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

## Conclusion
The discussion around super shoes in running highlights the broader [[ethical_and_philosophical_questions_surrounding_technology_in_sports | ethical and philosophical questions surrounding technology in sports]]. While technology aims to enhance human capabilities and achieve feats previously deemed impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>, it also raises questions about fairness, the spirit of the sport, and the line between correction and enhancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. This ongoing [[ethics_of_technological_advancements_in_athletics | debate]] extends far beyond sports, affecting how societies decide to integrate and regulate technological advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

Supersonic flight involves traveling faster than the speed of sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The speed of sound, also known as Mach 1, is approximately 767 mph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. For comparison, the world's fastest train travels around 286 mph, and an average Boeing 737 cruises at about 520 mph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## The Concorde Era
Twenty years ago, commercial passengers could fly faster than sound on the Concorde <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The Concorde was the world's first commercial supersonic aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

### Capabilities and Experience
The Concorde could travel from New York to London in just 3.5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, cruising at 1,350 mph—a speed comparable to a military F-16 fighter jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Passengers flew at an altitude so high they could see the curve of the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, and even faster than the Earth rotates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Inside the plane, there was no physical indication of going through the sound barrier, so an indicator was placed in the cabin for passengers to know when they achieved supersonic speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### Design and Innovations
The Concorde's design was considered futuristic even decades after its inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Key [[innovations_in_aircraft_design | innovations in aircraft design]] included:
*   A long, narrow body to reduce air resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   Wide, delta-shaped wings for lift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   A "droop snoot" nose that lowered for pilot visibility during takeoff and landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   Special powerful engines designed to handle rapid incoming air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   Special paint that discharged heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### The Problem of the Sonic Boom
A major [[challenges_faced_by_supersonic_planes | challenge faced by supersonic planes]] is the sonic boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. As a plane flies faster than sound, it creates pressure waves from the front and back that cannot move out of the way in time, compressing into waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. These waves are perceived as a "double bang" or "buh-boom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. A common misconception is that a sonic boom occurs only once when the plane breaks the sound barrier; in reality, it "booooooooms the whole time all along the path of the plane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, carpeting the ground below it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. The Concorde's sonic boom was comparable in loudness to a balloon pop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

Due to the loud sonic booms, the FAA banned commercial supersonic flights over the United States in 1973, with similar rules following globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This restriction dramatically reduced possible routes, largely limiting flights to over the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

### Retirement of the Concorde
The [[challenges_faced_by_supersonic_planes | challenges faced by supersonic planes]], including fuel-guzzling engines, rising fuel costs, and a deadly crash in 2000, led to decreased public reception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Air France stopped flying the Concorde, eventually forcing British Airways to retire its fleet on April 10, 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. The Concorde, despite being ahead of its time, could not overcome the sonic boom problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## The Future of Supersonic Flight
NASA believes that [[future_of_commercial_supersonic_travel | commercial supersonic flight]] can be brought back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### NASAs X-59 Supersonic Plane Development
[[nasas_x59_supersonic_plane_development | NASAs X59 supersonic plane development]] aims to fix the sonic boom problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. The X-59, built by Lockheed Martin, is a single-seater jet designed to prove that supersonic planes can be quiet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. It can travel at 925 mph (1.4 times the speed of sound) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

The goal of the X-59 project is to change regulations to allow supersonic flight over land, provided the sound level is below a certain threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. NASA anticipates that 75 perceived level dB will be sufficiently quiet, sounding like a neighbor closing a car door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

The X-59's design incorporates [[innovations_in_aircraft_design | innovations in aircraft design]] to mitigate the sonic boom:
*   **Longer Nose:** The X-59 features a 38-foot fixed carbon fiber nose, significantly longer than the Concorde's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This nose is crucial for reducing the sonic boom by minimizing the initial "splash" of air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Since the pilot cannot see out the front, a camera provides a live video feed for takeoff and landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Smooth Underside:** The bottom of the aircraft is designed to be very smooth and clean, directing any shock-creating bumps or elements to the top of the plane, sending pressure waves upwards and away from the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **T-Tail:** A T-tail on the X-59 creates its own shockwave, which interacts with and cancels out some of the boom from the back of the airplane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **Anti-Static Paint:** A special anti-static paint prevents the buildup of static electricity as the plane moves through the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

The X-59 is a one-off experimental aircraft, not a passenger plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>, built to demonstrate the capability of low-boom supersonic flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

### Outlook for Commercial Supersonic Travel
If NASA succeeds in changing the regulation against supersonic flight over land, it could open the floodgates for more companies and planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. Private companies, such as Boom, are already working to bring back supersonic passenger planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

The process of testing the X-59 and going through the regulation process will take a number of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. It is anticipated that [[future_of_commercial_supersonic_travel | passenger supersonic flight]] is at least a decade away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. Some companies have set a goal of bringing their planes to market by the end of the current decade, and three airlines have already placed orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

Future supersonic planes will need to be more sustainable, consume less fuel, be cheaper, and carry more than one passenger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. The ability to go farther and faster has historically led to greater connection and exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. Experts believe another supersonic airliner offering commercial travel is possible in the not-too-distant future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

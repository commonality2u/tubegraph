When falling into a [[inner_workings_of_black_holes | black hole]], particularly a smaller one, an object or person experiences extreme forces known as tidal forces, leading to a phenomenon colloquially termed [[the_concept_of_event_horizons_and_spaghettification | spaghettification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:05">[02:00:05]</a>.

## Understanding Tidal Forces

Tidal forces are similar to the forces that cause tides in Earth's oceans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:11">[02:00:11]</a>. They arise because the gravitational pull of a massive object is not uniform across an extended body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:28">[02:05:28]</a>. The part of the body closer to the massive object experiences a stronger pull than the part further away.

### Effects of Tidal Forces

As an object or person falls freely towards a black hole, the tidal forces begin to stretch and squash them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:16">[02:00:16]</a>. This means that the gravitational pull at one end of the body (e.g., your feet) is significantly different from the pull at the other end (e.g., your head), causing a dramatic stretching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:15">[02:05:15]</a>. Simultaneously, there's a squashing effect perpendicular to the stretching, so a body would be stretched in one direction and compressed in the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:25">[02:06:25]</a>.

The closer one gets to the [[inner_workings_of_black_holes | singularity]] at the heart of the black hole, the more extreme these effects become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:37">[02:06:37]</a>. Eventually, the body would cease to hold together, becoming a long string of atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:47">[02:06:47]</a>. Further collapse would separate the atoms, then the protons, and even the quarks inside the protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:49">[02:06:49]</a>. According to [[Einsteins theory of relativity and black holes | Einstein's theory]], the tidal forces become formally infinite at the [[inner_workings_of_black_holes | singularity]], ripping everything apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:53">[02:06:53]</a>.

## Impact of Black Hole Mass

The experience of [[the_concept_of_event_horizons_and_spaghettification | spaghettification]] depends significantly on the mass of the black hole:
*   **Smaller Black Holes:** For black holes that are a few times the mass of the Sun, tidal forces are felt intensely *before* crossing the [[the_concept_of_event_horizons_and_spaghettification | event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:05">[02:00:05]</a>. The object would be [[the_concept_of_event_horizons_and_spaghettification | spaghettified]] and destroyed well before reaching the [[the_concept_of_event_horizons_and_spaghettification | event horizon]].
*   **Supermassive Black Holes:** For extremely large black holes, such as Sagittarius A* at the center of our galaxy (approximately 6 million times the mass of the Sun) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>, the tidal forces are less pronounced at the [[the_concept_of_event_horizons_and_spaghettification | event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:45">[02:00:45]</a>. An object could cross the [[the_concept_of_event_horizons_and_spaghettification | event horizon]] without immediately noticing any stretching or squashing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:59">[01:59:59]</a>. The severe tidal forces would only become apparent deeper inside the black hole, as one approaches the [[inner_workings_of_black_holes | singularity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:51">[02:00:51]</a>. This is because the distortion in spacetime is not constant over the length of the body until it gets very close to the immense gravitational pull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:34">[02:05:34]</a>.

## Different Perspectives

The experience of falling into a black hole also differs depending on the observer's perspective:
*   **Infalling Observer:** From the perspective of someone freely falling into a supermassive black hole, according to [[Einsteins theory of relativity and black holes | Einstein's theory]], nothing would be felt as they cross the [[the_concept_of_event_horizons_and_spaghettification | event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:59">[01:59:59]</a>. Clocks would continue to tick normally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. The demise would be a result of [[the_concept_of_event_horizons_and_spaghettification | spaghettification]] as they approach the [[inner_workings_of_black_holes | singularity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:31">[02:00:31]</a>.
*   **Outside Observer:** From the perspective of someone outside the black hole, time for the infalling object would appear to slow down drastically as it approaches the [[the_concept_of_event_horizons_and_spaghettification | event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:08">[02:12:08]</a>. Their time would effectively stop on the horizon, and they would never be seen to fall in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:31">[02:22:31]</a>. The light emitted from the infalling object would become increasingly redshifted, eventually fading away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:53">[02:22:53]</a>. The external observer would describe the infalling object's demise as incineration, vaporized before crossing the horizon due to the extreme heat from [[Hawking radiation and black hole evaporation | Hawking radiation]] near the horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:48">[02:44:48]</a>.

## The Singularity

The ultimate destination for anything falling into a black hole, after being [[the_concept_of_event_horizons_and_spaghettification | spaghettified]], is the [[inner_workings_of_black_holes | singularity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:31">[02:00:31]</a>. This [[inner_workings_of_black_holes | singularity]] is not a place in space, but rather a moment in time—specifically, the end of time according to [[Einsteins theory of relativity and black holes | Einstein's theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:19">[02:09:19]</a>. Once an object crosses the [[the_concept_of_event_horizons_and_spaghettification | event horizon]], the [[inner_workings_of_black_holes | singularity]] becomes its inevitable future, akin to how "tomorrow" is an unavoidable future event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:02">[02:10:02]</a>.

## Information Paradox and Ongoing Research

The existence of [[the_concept_of_event_horizons_and_spaghettification | spaghettification]] and the eventual demise at the [[inner_workings_of_black_holes | singularity]] raises profound questions, particularly regarding the [[the_information_paradox_and_the_future_of_black_hole_research | information paradox]]. While [[Einsteins theory of relativity and black holes | Einstein's theory]] suggests that information is destroyed at the [[inner_workings_of_black_holes | singularity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:44">[03:06:44]</a>, [[Hawking radiation and black hole evaporation | Hawking's calculations]] initially proposed that black holes emit informationless thermal radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:55">[03:55:55]</a>. This clashes with the fundamental laws of nature, which state that information is never destroyed, only scrambled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:49">[03:07:49]</a>.

Recent research, building on [[Hawking radiation and black hole evaporation | Hawking's work]], suggests that information *is* imprinted in the emitted radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:35">[03:38:35]</a>. This ongoing debate about how information escapes a black hole when nothing, by definition, can escape the [[the_concept_of_event_horizons_and_spaghettification | event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:05">[03:09:05]</a>, is at the forefront of [[the_information_paradox_and_the_future_of_black_hole_research | black hole research]] and quantum gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:08">[03:04:08]</a>. It's pushing the boundaries of our understanding of spacetime itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.

Journalism traditionally emphasizes skepticism, particularly when evaluating new ideas and technologies. However, there's a growing argument for integrating a more optimistic perspective, especially concerning future innovations and societal well-being.

## Traditional Skepticism and Its Limitations

Historically, new ideas have often been met with significant skepticism in the media. An old newspaper article from October 9th, 1903, titled "Flying Machines Which Do Not Fly," illustrates this point by dismissing the possibility of sustained flight, stating it would take "from one million to ten million years" for a flying machine to "really fly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Just two months later, the Wright brothers achieved their famous assisted flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

This pattern of dismissal before acceptance is common for groundbreaking ideas: from "It’s not possible" to "It’s too expensive," then "Do people really need that?", followed by "Oh, it’s just a fad," and finally "Oh my god, it changed the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. While not all journalists engage in it, there's a tendency for media to portray new ideas as implausible because these stories are often "easier to tell" and "people really like to read them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## The Case for Journalistic Optimism

A shift towards a more optimistic journalistic approach is advocated for several reasons:

*   **Guidance and Course Correction**: Engaging with the potential success of new tools earlier allows for "guiding new tools early" and "course correcting, together, before things go… off the rails" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This means proactively addressing [[ethical_debates_and_societal_implications|societal implications]] and ensuring innovations benefit the most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Combating Pessimism and [[The impact of fear mongering in media|Fear Mongering]]**: A pervasive sense of pessimism, fueled by "political nihilism, economic fear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a> and "very lucrative fear mongering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, can lead to feelings of helplessness and powerlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. By imagining "what could go right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, journalism can empower individuals to feel that "there was more that we could do to make the world better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This [[importance_of_optimistic_visions_for_future_innovation|optimistic outlook]] is crucial for fostering engagement in problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Rigorous Engagement with Possibility**: While skepticism is vital for pointing out challenges, journalists also have a "responsibility... to help people imagine what could go right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This involves a "journalistically rigorous, genuinely optimistic" exploration of technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, presenting potential solutions and their best-case scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## "Let Me Explain": A New Journalistic Endeavor

A new show called "Let Me Explain" aims to embody this approach by offering "journalistically rigorous, genuinely optimistic explanations about technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Described as "like Black Mirror, but the opposite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, each episode will be a deep dive into an idea that "could change all of hour lives" if it comes true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

The creator, a video journalist who previously worked for Vox and contributed to "Explained" on Netflix and Vox’s YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, decided to go independent to explore these topics in a more personal and experimental way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. The show will feature [[interviews_with_tech_innovators_shaping_the_future|experts]] like Matt Yglesias, David Roberts, Dr. Tia Jackson-Bey, and Alexis Ohanian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, as well as other admired journalists like Johnny Harris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. It will invite audience participation, encouraging viewers to suggest topics that make them pessimistic or overwhelmed for investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

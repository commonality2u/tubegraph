NASA recently unveiled the [[first_images_from_the_james_webb_space_telescope | first full-color images]] from the most powerful telescope ever built, marking "the dawn of a new era" in space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Among these astounding images, one particular view, though perhaps not the "prettiest," holds immense significance for the search for life beyond Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This image represents a crucial step in understanding how to find aliens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## The Exoplanet Landscape

There are approximately 5,000 known planets outside our solar system, referred to as "exoplanets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This number is likely a vast underestimate, given that previous efforts, like pointing the Kepler telescope at one column of space for four years, yielded a significant number of discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The mapping of these exoplanets is the result of decades of scientific work and major technological advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Despite this progress, the vastness of our "cosmic house" still feels empty, with no other life discovered so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Searching for Life Through Biosignatures

Identifying whether a tiny speck of light in the distance is even a planet, let alone what's on it, is incredibly challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. However, the [[first_images_from_the_james_webb_space_telescope | James Webb Space Telescope]] (JWST) offers a new approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

If one were to observe Earth from a great distance, visible signs of life like people, cities, or lights would be imperceptible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. However, if one could detect that Earth's atmosphere contains 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, it would indicate a strong possibility of finding life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. These "indicators of life" are known as biosignatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

The JWST possesses the unique ability to detect these biosignatures on other planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### The Method: Analyzing Starlight Dips

The process relies on observing transiting exoplanets:
1.  When a planet passes between us and its star, it causes a slight dip in the starlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. These dips were initially used to locate many exoplanets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
2.  Crucially, the planet doesn't block *all* the starlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. A small amount of light passes *through* the planet's atmosphere before reaching us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
3.  Different gases in an atmosphere absorb or block different kinds of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
4.  The [[first_images_from_the_james_webb_space_telescope | James Webb Space Telescope]] is powerful enough to detect which specific wavelengths of light are "missing" from the starlight, thus revealing the atmospheric composition of the exoplanet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

This process involves observing "tiny, tiny specks of darkness against tiny, tiny specks of light" in the vastness of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Case Study: [[WASP 96b and detection of water vapor | WASP 96b]]

Scientists directed the [[first_images_from_the_james_webb_space_telescope | James Webb Space Telescope]] to analyze [[WASP 96b and detection of water vapor | WASP 96b]], a gas giant exoplanet located 1,150 light-years away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. The light detected by the telescope from WASP 96b left the planet over a millennium ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

By analyzing the missing wavelengths in the starlight, scientists determined that [[WASP 96b and detection of water vapor | WASP 96b]]'s atmosphere contains water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. It's important to note that this doesn't signify the discovery of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. [[WASP 96b and detection of water vapor | WASP 96b]] is a "hot world" with a steamy atmosphere, meaning the water is in vapor form, not liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

While water vapor has been detected on other planets closer to Earth (within a couple hundred light-years), the ability to gain such detailed atmospheric information from a planet over 1,000 light-years away is an incredible feat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## The Dawn of a New Era for the [[future_possibilities_in_the_search_for_extraterrestrial_life | Search for Extraterrestrial Life]]

The analysis of [[WASP 96b and detection of water vapor | WASP 96b]] serves as a "proof of concept" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:09">[04:09:09]</a>. It demonstrates that this method of searching for atmospheric compositions on exoplanets works, and "there's a LOT more to come" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:06">[04:06:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:09">[04:09:09]</a>. This marks just the beginning of what the [[first_images_from_the_james_webb_space_telescope | James Webb Space Telescope]] can achieve in the [[future_possibilities_in_the_search_for_extraterrestrial_life | search for extraterrestrial life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:09">[04:13:09]</a>.

The present moment is considered one of the most exciting in scientific history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:07">[04:25:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:04">[04:30:04]</a>. With space as the "final frontier," humanity is actively "seeking out new life and new civilizations" to see what has never been seen before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:04">[04:33:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:08">[04:36:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:02">[04:40:02]</a>. This is no longer science fiction, but a tangible reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:03">[04:43:03]</a>.

The sale of digital art, known as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), for millions of dollars raises fundamental questions about how art is valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This includes pieces selling for $1.2 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, $29 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, and even $69.3 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. While explanations often focus on the underlying blockchain technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, they rarely address why these digital assets command such high prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. To truly understand this, it's necessary to examine the "incredibly strange way we value art to begin with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Historical Precedent: The 1973 Scull Auction

The story of how art became astronomically expensive predates NFTs, tracing back to a pivotal moment in 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. On October 18, 1973, in New York City, Robert and Ethel Scull, pioneering collectors of living artists like Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, and Jasper Johns, hosted an auction at Sotheby's that fundamentally changed the art world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

This event was significant because it was "the first time that living artists were selling for many tens of millions of dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The public reaction was largely negative, with many criticizing it as an unseemly "marriage between art and money," echoing current sentiments about NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

A famous incident involved Robert Rauschenberg getting into a fistfight at the auction because he couldn't believe the price his work was trading for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Rauschenberg had originally sold his art for $900, but it sold for $85,000 at the auction, with the artist receiving none of the profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This moment marked a turning point where art prices exploded permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### The Rise of Artist as Celebrity

According to David Galperin, Head of Contemporary Art for the Americas at Sotheby’s, this period was when "living artists became [[the_role_of_celebrity_and_hype_in_valuing_art | celebrities]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Andy Warhol, in particular, utilized [[the_role_of_celebrity_and_hype_in_valuing_art | celebrity]] as his medium, becoming as famous as the [[the_role_of_celebrity_and_hype_in_valuing_art | celebrities]] he depicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

This shift meant that art's value became less tied to its physical form or traditional metrics like cost of production or time spent creating it. Instead, value became increasingly about "the artist’s personal [[the_role_of_celebrity_and_hype_in_valuing_art | celebrity]] or the ideas behind the art" <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, transforming the question of value into "How much is that idea worth?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Since then, the art market has "entirely exploded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## Expanding Definitions of Art and Value

The explosion in the market also led to an expansion of what art itself could be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Art could manifest as:
*   Text phrases in public places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>
*   A pile of candy slowly eaten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>
*   A banana taped to a wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>
*   Even instructions for making the art oneself, as seen in Sol LeWitt's wall drawings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

For artists like Sol LeWitt, the artwork is not the physical drawing but the certificate or instructions, without which the "artwork has no value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

Andy Warhol famously "loved toying with that notion" of originality and copies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. He even provided his silkscreen to appropriation artist Elaine Sturtevant, who copied his works, highlighting that the question of "what is original and what is a copy?" is central to understanding his art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

Ultimately, when art becomes "branding and concept," it also becomes intertwined with [[how_art_functions_as_investment_and_speculation | hype and ego and speculation and investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. While some interpret high art prices as "money laundering," and indeed, fraud exists in the art world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, this explanation avoids the deeper truth: "some people really pay for the concept behind the art, and what they own is the fact that they bought it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

## NFTs: A New Arbiter of Value

The fundamental difference between NFTs and previous art forms is not *why* they have value, but *who decides* their value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. With NFTs, a new group of enthusiasts is defining what is valuable, sometimes in defiance of traditional art critics who might dismiss them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

For NFTs, value can stem from aesthetic appeal, as noted by Reddit founder and investor Alexis Ohanian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, who states he buys NFTs if he "liked the vibe of it" and "how it looked aesthetically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. NFTs can also have utility, functioning as tickets to events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

The ability for NFTs to gain significant value stems from the development of a widely accepted database—the blockchain—that records ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. As Ohanian explains, "As long as there is a critical mass of people who believe in it, that is the only database that matters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Thus, even if a digital image can be screenshotted or copied endlessly, the value lies in the ownership credential within that agreed-upon database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

### The "Screenshot" Fallacy

The common argument, "Oh, I can just screenshot that" or "Why do NFTs have any value?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, isn't a new critique. It echoes questions the art world has grappled with for decades: "What is value? Where does it come from? What is too much, for too little?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

NFTs push these questions to an extreme by introducing "more money? And no physical product? And anyone decides?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. This new iteration of art makes many uncomfortable, especially given prices that can exceed that of a house for a digital image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

Ultimately, NFTs are part of the larger context of art itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. They represent a new medium and canvas, with a new generation of artists creating exclusively with digital platforms in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. In this shiny new form, NFTs reflect our own evolving understanding of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

While the expansion of satellite internet aims to provide global connectivity, it poses significant challenges for astronomers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:30">[12:51:30]</a>.

## Interference with Observations
New satellite internet projects, particularly those deploying large constellations of satellites in low Earth orbit, can disrupt astronomical observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:30">[12:51:30]</a>. An astronomer noted that sending tens of thousands of satellites into low Earth orbit poses a real threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:53">[12:53:53]</a>.

For example, [[starlink_and_satellite_internet | Starlink]] satellites are visible from Earth and can "really mess up" the science of astronomers looking at the stars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>.

## Importance of Ground-Based Astronomy
Ground-based astronomy is crucial for answering questions about our universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. It also plays a vital role in planetary defense against asteroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>.

## Balancing Connectivity and Research
There is a need to find ways to provide internet access to the remaining 4 billion people on the planet while simultaneously protecting the ability to observe the night sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>. Potential solutions include providing more data on satellite locations to allow astronomers to avoid them, or establishing more regulations regarding satellite placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>.

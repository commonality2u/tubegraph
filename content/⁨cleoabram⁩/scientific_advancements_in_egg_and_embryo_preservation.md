Egg and embryo freezing represents a significant advancement in reproductive technology, offering individuals greater control over their fertility timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This process involves removing eggs, freezing them, and then unfreezing them later for potential fertilization and pregnancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Embryos can also be created by mixing eggs with sperm and then frozen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Essentially, it allows for a form of "cryosleep" for tiny balls of cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Changing Trends in Parenthood

The average age of first-time mothers in the US has shifted significantly. Thirty years ago, it was 20 to 29; now, it's 25 to 34, with the most common age being 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This shift is partly due to more women prioritizing education and careers, choosing to have children later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Biological Challenges of Fertility

While the timing of parenthood is changing, human bodies are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. As individuals age, it can become more challenging to conceive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

### The Reproductive Process
Conception requires an egg, sperm, and roughly nine months inside a uterus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. An egg released from an ovary is picked up by a fallopian tube, where it waits for sperm for 12 to 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. If fertilized, the tiny embryo must travel into the uterus and begin to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This intricate process needs to go right for pregnancy to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Egg Quantity and Quality
Women are born with all the eggs they will ever have, approximately one million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. However, around 10,000 eggs die every month during childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, leaving about 300,000 eggs at puberty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Each month, one egg is released while another thousand die, leading to a significant decline in egg quantity over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

More crucial than quantity is "egg quality," which refers to whether an egg has 23 chromosomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. The chances of an egg not having 23 chromosomes increase with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Most embryos formed from eggs with abnormal chromosome numbers do not implant or grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

Dr. Pfeifer, a reproductive endocrinologist and surgeon, explains that as an egg prepares to be fertilized, it duplicates its DNA and divides it in half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Younger eggs are more likely to successfully divide 46 chromosomes into two equal halves of 23, while older eggs may not do so effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

A woman's fertility begins to decline in her early to mid-30s, not just after 35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Data shows that miscarriage rates increase with age, and the monthly odds of getting pregnant decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. For example, a 32-year-old woman is expected to have approximately 80% chromosomally normal eggs, compared to only 20% for a 42-year-old woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

## The Science of Cryopreservation (Vitrification)

[[Technological advancements in pregnancy and childbirth | Egg and embryo freezing]] is akin to sci-fi "cryosleep," effectively pausing cells in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. The key to this technology is addressing the issue of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. When water freezes, it expands and forms sharp crystals that would damage cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. To prevent this, most water is replaced with a special antifreeze mixture, and the cells are cooled quickly and evenly in a process called vitrification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. This solidifies the mixture without forming damaging ice crystals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

Vitrification works for eggs and embryos because their high surface area to volume ratio allows for rapid cooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. This technology only became possible for eggs in the 1980s and was no longer considered experimental in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Researchers are also working on vitrifying whole organs for transplants, and potentially even whole people in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

## The [[egg_freezing_process | Egg Freezing Process]]

Before freezing, multiple eggs must be retrieved from a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. This involves hormone injections over 8 to 14 days to stimulate the ovaries to produce multiple eggs instead of just one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. These hormones also prevent the spontaneous release of eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. This medication regimen is identical to the first phase of [[egg_freezing_process | in vitro fertilization (IVF)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

### Personal Experience
The process of self-injecting hormones can be daunting at first but becomes easier over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. It requires significant time and mental energy, including planning and coordinating with insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

### Physical Toll and Monitoring
The hormone shots often cause symptoms such as bloating, mood swings, and headaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. More serious side effects, like Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS), where ovaries respond too strongly and build up fluid, can also occur and be dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. To manage this, regular blood tests and hormone level checks are required every other day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

### Egg Retrieval
After the hormone injections, a precisely timed "trigger shot" is administered to prepare the body to release the eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. The egg retrieval surgery must occur exactly 35 hours after this shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. The procedure is typically 15 minutes long, performed under anesthesia, where a needle is used to extract the prepared eggs from the ovaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. After retrieval, eggs are processed and stored in secure, cryopreserved tanks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

## Challenges and Considerations

Despite the advancements, [[cost_and_accessibility_of_egg_freezing | egg and embryo freezing]] presents several challenges:
*   **Cost**: Depending on medical history, location, and insurance, costs can range from being fully covered to tens of thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.
*   **Uncertain Outcome**: The process does not guarantee success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.
    *   The average number of eggs retrieved per cycle is about 10, with a goal of 20, often requiring multiple cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.
    *   Approximately 85-90% of eggs survive freezing and thawing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.
    *   The average fertilization rate is 75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.
    *   Only about half of fertilized eggs develop into viable embryos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.
    *   For a 30-31 year old, 75-80% of embryos are expected to be chromosomally normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.
    *   Each chromosomally normal embryo has about a 55-60% chance of resulting in a live birth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.
    *   This makes the process a significant amount of work for an uncertain outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

## Future of Reproductive Technology

Currently, egg and embryo freezing is difficult, expensive, and not guaranteed to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>. However, there is optimism for the future. In 5, 10, or 20 years, it is hoped that the technology will become cheaper, simpler, and much more reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.

If this occurs, it could significantly impact [[societal_implications_of_reproductive_technology | societal implications]] and individual lives, allowing more people to have children when they choose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. This includes individuals with medical conditions, those who haven't found a partner, or simply those who wish to choose their own timeline for family planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. Continued research and scientific efforts aim to make the "heartwarming, sometimes heartbreaking math of fertility just a little bit easier every year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.

The sale of digital art, known as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), for millions of dollars has raised significant questions about how such value is determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Skepticism often arises from the ability to easily copy digital images, leading many to question their intrinsic worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. However, understanding the pricing of NFTs requires stepping back to examine the inherently "strange way we [[value_of_art_and_its_evolution | value art]] to begin with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Evolution of Art Value: A Historical Precedent

The current discourse around NFT valuation mirrors historical shifts in how traditional art has been priced. A pivotal moment occurred on October 18, 1973, in New York City, at an auction hosted by prominent collectors Robert and Ethel Scull at Sotheby's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This event was notable as it was "the first time that living artists were selling for many tens of millions of dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

The public reaction then, much like the reaction to NFTs today, was largely negative. Critics felt it represented an unseemly "marriage between art and money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Artist Robert Rauschenberg even engaged in a fistfight at the auction, outraged that his work, originally sold for $900, was reselling for $85,000 without him receiving any of the profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### From Object to Concept: The Rise of Celebrity and Ideas

This 1973 auction marked a turning point where [[the_role_of_celebrity_and_hype_in_valuing_art | living artists became celebrities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Andy Warhol, for example, used celebrity as his medium, eventually becoming as famous as the celebrities he depicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. When art's [[value_of_art_and_its_evolution | value]] became tied to the artist's personal fame or the underlying concepts rather than the physical object, it became "untethered from other benchmarks of value" such as production cost, creation time, or aesthetic appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The question shifted to: "How much is that idea worth?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

Since this period, art prices have consistently risen, and the very definition of "what art IS" has expanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Examples of conceptual art that challenge traditional notions of value include:
*   Text phrases displayed publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>
*   A pile of candy, meant to be slowly eaten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>
*   A banana taped to a wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>
*   Instructions for making the art yourself, where the artwork is the certificate rather than the physical drawing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>

This shift implies that for many, what they own is not merely the object but "the fact that they bought it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. While concerns about money laundering and fraud exist in the art world, these instances do not fully explain the genuine belief in the value of conceptual art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## NFTs: Digital Art and the Democratization of Value

The common dismissive comment, "Oh I can just screenshot that" when referring to NFTs, reveals a misunderstanding of how digital art derives its value, which parallels conceptual art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. The fundamental difference between NFTs and earlier forms of art lies not in *why* they have value, but in "**who decides**" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

With NFTs, a new group of enthusiasts dictates [[value_of_art_and_its_evolution | value]], often challenging the traditional art establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. The underlying technology, blockchain, provides a publicly agreed-upon database of ownership, analogous to a certificate of authenticity for a traditional artwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The fact that an NFT is essentially "a link to an image" means that its value resides in the verifiable ownership record, not the easily copied image itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### The Certificate of Ownership: Physical and Digital Parallels

The concept of a certificate being the artwork's true value is not new. Sol LeWitt's wall drawings, for instance, are site-specific and painted on site, with the true artwork being the certificate that allows its recreation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Similarly, Andy Warhol deliberately toyed with notions of originality; he even gave his silkscreen to appropriation artist Elaine Sturtevant so she could copy his works, highlighting that the "idea of like, 'what is original and what is a copy?' is a question that is so integral to the understanding and the appreciation of his art" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

The art collective MSCHF demonstrated this further by buying an Andy Warhol drawing, making 999 exact copies, mixing the original among them, and selling each for $250. This experiment highlighted that most people would pay more for the original, especially if it came with a "certificate of some kind," because they believe others would also [[how_art_functions_as_investment_and_speculation | value]] it more, allowing for resale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

## Conclusion: The Same Equation, New Extremes

NFTs are not a new phenomenon in their mechanisms of value creation, but rather an extreme manifestation of long-standing art world principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. They amplify the existing questions about art's [[value_of_art_and_its_evolution | value]]: "What is value? Where does it come from? What is too much, for too little?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. The discomfort many feel stems from the combination of exorbitant prices, the absence of a physical product, and the decentralized nature of who determines this value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

Ultimately, NFTs are part of the much larger context of art itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. They represent a new medium, a "new canvas" enabled by technology, where a new generation of artists will create exclusively with digital in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. In this [[ai_art_creation_and_its_implications | new form of art]], we see a reflection of our own flexible and evolving understanding of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

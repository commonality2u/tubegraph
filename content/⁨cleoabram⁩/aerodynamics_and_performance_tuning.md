Formula 1 cars are "epic group science projects" where 10 teams compete fiercely, involving hundreds of people and millions of dollars to [[engineering_and_technology_in_formula_1 | push technology to its limit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. These vehicles are among the fastest and most expensive cars globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Unlike IndyCar, where all cars use the same chassis, each Formula 1 team must design and manufacture their own cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Winning begins at the factory with the car's construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, adhering to regulations set by the FIA and F1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This regulatory framework is "the formula" in Formula 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

The amount of [[engineering_and_technology_in_formula_1 | engineering]] involved is "next level," utilizing many techniques and technologies akin to those used by NASA or SpaceX for designing rockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Aerodynamic Principles

A winning Formula 1 car needs to excel at both making super quick turns and achieving extreme speeds in a straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The challenge lies in the fact that optimizing for one often hinders the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. The team that best balances these two aspects takes home the trophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### Downforce and Grip

To make quick turns, a strong grip on the ground is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. This is achieved by generating "downforce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. More downforce means stronger grip and quicker turns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. A Formula 1 car can be thought of as an airplane upside down: while air moving across a plane's wings lifts it up, here, the air across the car forces it down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. The goal is to create higher pressure above the car and lower pressure below it, which literally "sucks the car into the ground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

Lower pressure air is achieved by getting it to move "really fast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>, specifically by speeding up the air as much as possible under the floor and slowing it down as much as possible on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

A particularly cool method for achieving fast, low-pressure air is the creation of "tiny tornadoes" or "vortices" under the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. These highly powerful, rotating structures generate a lot of low pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. These structures then run down the length of the floor, generating low pressure over a long region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, helping to suck the car towards the ground for better grip and faster turns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. At top speed, a Formula 1 car generates downforce three or four times its weight, theoretically allowing it to drive on the ceiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

### Drag and Straight-Line Speed

All this downforce comes at a cost: to go super fast in a straight line, the car needs to knife through the air with as little "drag" as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. However, increased downforce usually leads to added drag, which is a resistive force preventing the car from moving through the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

For instance, the back wing generates downforce for turns but acts like a "big parachute" slowing the car down in a straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. To counteract this, Formula 1 teams are allowed to incorporate a **Drag Reduction System (DRS)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This system allows the driver to press a control to flip part of the wing down, enabling the car to zoom faster down the straights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

Designing a winning Formula 1 car means balancing these different effects, pushing the rules and the limits of physics to gain a little more grip and a little more speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## Performance Tuning Through Design & Manufacturing

Each team's goal is to create the two fastest cars possible within the rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This involves meticulous design and manufacturing processes.

### Materials

Formula 1 cars are exceptionally light, fast, and strong because almost every visible part is made of carbon fiber, a material 10 times stronger than steel but half the weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Carbon fiber's high strength-to-weight ratio allows parts to be extremely light while retaining significant structure and strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Teams manufacture carbon fiber parts by laying down sometimes 100 layers of carbon fiber cloth into precise patterns, then removing air and using a pressure cooker to squeeze the layers together with resin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

Metal parts are also crucial, with the choice of metal depending on its required function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. Aluminum is widely used throughout the car for parts and components because it is generally light and fairly strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. Conversely, a dense alloy called densimet is used to add weight to the car when the driver isn't up to the minimum required weight, added in tiny strips throughout the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

### Engine Development

The engine is paramount, with the goal being "maximum power" because drivers will always ask for more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. Most cars use a four-stroke internal combustion engine with a V6 configuration (six cylinders in a V shape) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. A key difference from consumer cars is the engine's maximum cycles per minute: Formula 1 cars achieve over 15,000 cycles compared to around 6,000 for a typical car, contributing to more power and speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.

F1 engines also incorporate technologies like a turbocharger, which compresses air before it enters the cylinder, packing more punch when ignited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. This constant push for performance in engines helps inspire better car technology for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. Regulations for 2026 will see engines using less fuel and more electricity, leading to a slightly different sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. Teams like Red Bull are investing heavily in custom engine development to gain speed and control by integrating the engine and chassis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

### Research and Development

Teams are constantly testing designs in computer simulations, physical rigs that mimic a moving car, and large wind tunnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Due to limitations on testing full-size cars in wind tunnels, teams build and test 60% scale versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

The paint job on a Formula 1 car is critical not just for aesthetics but also for speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Sponsor logos, for example, are painted on rather than being stickers, as even a tiny edge could create unwanted drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

## In-Race Performance Tuning

### Driver and Car Customization

No two Formula 1 cars are exactly alike, even within the same team, because no two drivers are the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. Teams keep detailed measurements for each driver's seat and pedal position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. The carbon fiber seat is custom-fitted to the driver, who spends 3-4 hours getting it formed around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

The custom steering wheel of each team has dozens of buttons, knobs, and switches to optimize the engine, tires, brakes, and more in every possible scenario, all while the driver is racing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. Drivers memorize all these controls to operate them without looking at the wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

### Pit Stops and Tire Strategy

At least once per race, cars enter their pit box, where roughly 22 pit crew members swarm the car to quickly change tires and other parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. A good pit stop takes less than 2 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

Teams have the same tire options for each race: hard, medium, and soft compounds, or two types of wet tires for rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. Soft tires offer the most grip but wear out fastest, while hard tires are on the opposite end of the spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. Drivers can feel when their tires are losing grip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. Choosing the right tires at the right time is a significant part of a team's [[role_of_strategy_and_simulations_in_racing | race strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

### Race Strategy and Simulations

During a race, drivers communicate with their race engineer, who is also in contact with a massive team of strategists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. Most strategists are located back at the factory in a room that "looks like NASA" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>. These strategists use supercomputers to run "millions" of simulations about possible outcomes, considering factors like weather, brake heat, tire performance, and competitors' actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. This real-time data is fed back to the track to inform decisions aimed at winning the race and reacting to competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.

## Continuous Development

A Formula 1 car is never truly "done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. A team is constantly learning, changing, and rebuilding the car between every single race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>. This constant evolution is a story of human ingenuity and, increasingly, human collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>. The magic of a Formula 1 car lies in the collaborative effort of engineers, designers, strategists, and athletes to build something that gets "better and better and better every single time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

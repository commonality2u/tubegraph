[[introduction_to_quantum_computers | Quantum computers]] are fundamentally different from the classical computers we use today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. They are not simply bigger or faster versions of existing machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This core difference is key to understanding their significance and the global race to develop them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## How They Work: Bits vs. Qubits

### Classical Computers and Bits
Classical computers operate using "bits," which are typically made from pieces of silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. These bits exist in one of two binary states: zero (ground state) or one (excited state) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Everything entered into a classical computer—words, numbers, colors—is translated into this binary computer language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### Quantum Computers and Qubits
[[introduction_to_quantum_computers | Quantum computers]] run on "qubits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Unlike bits, qubits are more complex; they are not simply a one or a zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Qubits can be thought of like waves, having a probability of being zero (lower energy wave) or one (higher energy wave) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. When a [[introduction_to_quantum_computers | quantum computer]] is operating, the probabilities of multiple qubits interact, constructively or destructively, similar to how waves in a pond would interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

Instead of "trying all the options," a [[introduction_to_quantum_computers | quantum computer]] observes how these probabilities interact, finding the most likely answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. This distinct calculation method makes them proficient at different tasks compared to classical computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

## Capabilities and Limitations

### Analogy: Cars vs. Boats
A famous analogy to understand the difference is to imagine navigating a mathematical map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **No computers**: Traveling across the map by walking (slow, limited exploration) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Early computers**: Riding horses, allowing faster travel and access to previously unreachable areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Modern classical computers**: Using roads and cars, reaching more areas faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **[[introduction_to_quantum_computers | Quantum computers]]**: Are like "boats," designed for entirely different terrain—navigating mathematical "waters" that traditional computers cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. They are not necessarily "better" than cars, but built for different purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

### What Quantum Computers Are Good For
[[introduction_to_quantum_computers | Quantum computers]] are not faster at everything; for instance, they are not ideal for simple addition, a task perfectly handled by a phone calculator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Their strength lies in:
*   **Finding structure in vast amounts of data** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   **[[potential_applications_of_quantum_computing | Simulating nature]]**: Nature fundamentally operates on quantum physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This capability could lead to advancements in battery technology, new materials with complex molecular chains, and medicines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. This is because it becomes extremely difficult for classical computers to calculate the behavior of materials or atoms at a certain size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **[[quantum_computing_and_encryption_challenges | Encryption and decryption]]**: The Shor's Algorithm for [[introduction_to_quantum_computers | quantum computers]] can efficiently find prime factors of large numbers, which is the basis for RSA encryption used in internet transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. While classical computers would take billions of years to crack RSA encryption by brute force, a [[introduction_to_quantum_computers | quantum computer]] could potentially do it in hours to days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. This potential capability fuels the global race for [[quantum_supremacy_and_global_competition | quantum supremacy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

## Physical Requirements
[[introduction_to_quantum_computers | Quantum computers]] require extreme conditions to operate. They are kept at temperatures colder than outer space, specifically around 15 millikelvin, making them one of the coldest things in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. The core quantum computer component is a small chip housed within a large dilution refrigerator, with numerous cables carrying signals to and from the processor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## Future Outlook
While current [[introduction_to_quantum_computers | quantum computers]] (e.g., IBM's 433-qubit record) are far from the million or more qubits required to break modern encryption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>, progress is incredibly fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Experts are confident that [[quantum_safe_algorithms | quantum-safe algorithms]] will become common in the next five years or less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. The continuous improvement and discovery of new applications are anticipated, as there are no known mathematical or physical limits preventing further development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. The world itself is quantum mechanical, suggesting a natural alignment for [[introduction_to_quantum_computers | quantum computing]] to help us understand it better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

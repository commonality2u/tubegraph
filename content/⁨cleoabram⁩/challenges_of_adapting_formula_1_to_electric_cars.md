[[Introduction to Formula 1 racing | Formula 1]] faces significant challenges in adapting to electric car technology due to various factors, including technological limitations, fan expectations, commercial interests, and an exclusive licensing agreement.

## The Existential Dilemma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>

The increasing global [[Transition to electric cars in racing | transition to electric cars in racing]] poses an existential threat to [[Introduction to Formula 1 racing | Formula 1]]. While consumer vehicles are rapidly shifting to electric power, [[Introduction to Formula 1 racing | Formula 1]] cars are not fully electric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This is problematic because [[Introduction to Formula 1 racing | Formula 1]]'s funding and appeal rely on major companies investing in and advertising their "cutting edge car tech" to promote consumer car sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. If the technology showcased in [[Introduction to Formula 1 racing | Formula 1]] becomes outdated, the sport risks losing its purpose and financial investment, becoming akin to horse racing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Governments worldwide are moving towards banning new gas car sales; California has already implemented this, and the entire European Union plans to do so by 2040 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. By 2040, owning a car with a tailpipe might be as anachronistic as owning one with a car phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This technological shift creates a critical juncture for [[Introduction to Formula 1 racing | Formula 1]], which is meant to showcase the future of automotive technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Barriers to Full Electric Conversion

A decade ago, when the idea of an electric racing series was first discussed, several factors prevented [[Introduction to Formula 1 racing | Formula 1]] from simply switching to electric cars:

*   **Battery Limitations:** [[Introduction to Formula 1 racing | Formula 1]] races require cars to cover at least 305 kilometers (190 miles) in under two hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Around 2011, electric car batteries lacked the capacity to meet these demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Resistance to Change:**
    *   **Fan Backlash:** Modifying the core nature of the sport to accommodate electric technology was feared to anger "millions of rabid F1 fans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
    *   **Manufacturer Opposition:** In 2011, most major car companies involved in [[Introduction to Formula 1 racing | Formula 1]] did not produce electric vehicles and were unwilling for the sport to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This situation exemplifies an "innovator's dilemma," where the incumbent fears threatening its existing successful model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## The [[Origins and development of Formula E | Formula E]] License

Instead of converting [[Introduction to Formula 1 racing | Formula 1]], the FIA (the governing body of motorsports) created a new, separate championship: [[Origins and development of Formula E | Formula E]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. [[Origins and development of Formula E | Formula E]] was granted an exclusive 25-year license to be the *only* fully electric racing championship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This license commenced with [[Origins and development of Formula E | Formula E]]'s launch in 2014 and expires in 2039 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

This means that [[Introduction to Formula 1 racing | Formula 1]] cannot become fully electric without violating this license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. While [[Introduction to Formula 1 racing | Formula 1]] implemented a hybrid powertrain in 2014, incorporating a turbo engine and two electric motors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>, it cannot be "purely electric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Although [[Introduction to Formula 1 racing | Formula 1]] could theoretically become 99% electric and 1% fuel, and the next generation of engines is moving towards a 50/50 split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, a complete transition to electric is prevented by the existing agreement with [[Origins and development of Formula E | Formula E]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

This situation creates a "collision course" between [[Introduction to Formula 1 racing | Formula 1]] and [[Origins and development of Formula E | Formula E]], as [[Introduction to Formula 1 racing | Formula 1]] needs to represent the future of cars to remain relevant, while [[Origins and development of Formula E | Formula E]] holds the exclusive rights to fully electric racing until 2039 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Future Outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>

The ban on combustion cars in the future means that [[Introduction to Formula 1 racing | Formula 1]] faces a significant challenge if it cannot race with the same technology being sold to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. The future could involve a merger between [[Introduction to Formula 1 racing | Formula 1]] and [[Origins and development of Formula E | Formula E]], or one buying the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. Despite the challenges, both championships are actively working on developing better technology for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

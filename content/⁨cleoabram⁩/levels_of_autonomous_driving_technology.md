The journey towards [[introduction_to_autonomous_vehicles | self-driving cars]] is not a sudden switch, but a gradual progression involving different levels of autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:28">[02:21:28]</a>. This evolution has been ongoing for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:15">[02:35:15]</a>.

## Historical Progression of Vehicle Autonomy

Early forms of driver assistance laid the groundwork for today's [[current_state_and_implementation_of_selfdriving_cars | autonomous vehicles]]:
*   **Mid-1900s**: Basic cruise control allowed drivers to set a speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:26">[02:38:26]</a>.
*   **Early 2000s**: Cars began offering help in critical moments, such as emergency braking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:08">[02:43:08]</a>.
*   **Later advancements**: More continuous support systems like lane centering or adaptive cruise control, which matches the speed of the car in front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:08">[02:48:08]</a>.

As technology advanced, the industry began to categorize the journey towards full self-driving into specific levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:31">[03:01:31]</a>.

## Standardized Levels of Self-Driving

The commonly referred-to levels of self-driving are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:14">[03:08:14]</a>:

### Level 0: Momentary Help
At this level, the car provides only momentary assistance to the driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:35">[03:12:35]</a>.

### Level 1: More Continuous Support
Vehicles offer more ongoing support for the driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:23">[03:15:23]</a>.

### Level 2: Newer Systems
This level includes highway piloting systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:03">[03:18:03]</a>. Most cars that are easily available for purchase today operate at Level 2, with humans still largely in charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:25">[03:24:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:04">[03:33:04]</a>.

### Higher Levels: Transitioning Control
As levels increase, the car takes on more responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:15">[03:38:15]</a>. The ideal progression involves:
*   **Human Monitoring**: Initially, humans would monitor the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:06">[03:41:06]</a>.
*   **Full Charge in Certain Situations (Implicit Level 4)**: The car becomes fully in charge, but only within specific situations or geographic areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. Examples include driverless taxis operating in specific cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:05">[04:03:05]</a>.
*   **Car in Charge Anywhere, Anytime (Level 5)**: This is the ultimate goal, where the car is fully autonomous in any condition, any time, with no human intervention needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:38">[03:50:38]</a>. This is often referred to as the "sci-fi version" and is still some distance away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:18">[04:21:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:12">[04:29:12]</a>.

## Current Focus and Competing Approaches

The current focus in [[current_state_and_implementation_of_selfdriving_cars | self-driving technology]] is not on achieving the full Level 5 immediately, but on advancing within the capabilities of full self-driving *with constraints* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:12">[04:36:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:48">[04:40:48]</a>. This involves two main divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:39">[05:38:39]</a>:

### Geographic and Complexity Constraints
Companies are developing solutions for:
*   **Less Complex Situations, Anywhere**: Training vehicles to drive in areas without excessive complexity, such as highways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:48">[04:44:48]</a>. This aligns with [[the_future_impact_of_selfdriving_technology_on_society_and_transportation | long-distance autonomous trucking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:07">[08:42:07]</a>. These trucks are already being used for deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:51">[09:17:51]</a> and are expected to significantly reshape how goods are moved, similar to how an excavator differs from manual labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:05">[09:07:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:04">[09:34:04]</a>.
*   **More Complex Situations, Geographically Constrained**: Training vehicles for complex environments like cities, but only within specific, predefined areas where they have been extensively trained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:30">[04:51:30]</a>. This approach is exemplified by robotaxi services, like Cruise in San Francisco, where vehicles operate without a human driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>.

### Carrying People vs. Goods
Another division is whether the autonomous vehicles carry people or goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:02">[08:31:02]</a>:
*   **Cities, No People**: This includes delivery robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:43">[08:33:43]</a>.
*   **Highways, No People**: This describes [[the_future_impact_of_selfdriving_technology_on_society_and_transportation | long-distance autonomous trucking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:07">[08:42:07]</a>.
*   **Cities, With People**: This is the domain of robotaxis, which provide driverless rides in urban environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. These vehicles, like the Cruise Origin, are designed without traditional driver controls such as a steering wheel or brake pedals, as drivers are not meant to take over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:21">[10:01:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:03">[10:23:03]</a>.

## Real-World Challenges and Nuances
[[challenges_and_considerations_in_deploying_selfdriving_vehicles | The deployment of self-driving cars]] reveals unexpected complexities in the interaction between humans and machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:48">[06:35:48]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Sleeping Passengers**: Driverless taxis have encountered situations where passengers fall asleep, requiring customer support to prompt them to exit the vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:33">[06:47:33]</a>.
*   **Interactions with Law Enforcement**: Incidents, such as a driverless car attempting to pull over and then moving to a safer spot after police walked away and turned off sirens, highlight the need for sophisticated detection and interaction protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:11">[07:16:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:19">[07:54:19]</a>.

## The Future Perspective

The current advancements indicate that [[current_state_and_implementation_of_selfdriving_cars | self-driving cars]] are here, though not yet in the single, go-anywhere sci-fi form envisioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:21">[01:29:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>. In the long term, humans might view driving cars as a "barbaric" practice due to the inherent risks and time consumption involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:31">[10:47:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:03">[11:01:03]</a>. The future of autonomous driving is being shaped in the "messy, messy middle" of these evolving levels and competing approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:23">[12:00:23]</a>.

Imagine flying through space and suddenly being dragged toward a dark abyss where reality begins to change, time warps, and you feel a strange sensation of being stretched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This is what it's like falling into a [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]], one of the universe's most astonishing places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## What is a Black Hole?
A [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]] forms when a star, like our sun, collapses and squashes down until its radius becomes incredibly small, for example, 3 km for a sun-mass star <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The gravity at its surface becomes so immense that the escape velocity — the speed needed to escape its gravitational pull — would exceed the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This means even light rays emitted from its surface would be trapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. A [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]] is a spot so massive with gravity so strong that not even light can escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

Initially, [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black holes]] were considered a mathematical quirk or theoretical solution to equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. However, decades of scientific observation, measuring the movement of stars, galaxies, and gases warped by seemingly empty space, confirmed that [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black holes]] are real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. These are often left behind by the collapsing death of stars much larger than our sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. It's estimated there are up to 40 quintillion [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black holes]] in our universe, with almost every galaxy, including our Milky Way, hosting a supermassive [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]] at its center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### Distorting Light and Spacetime
[[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | Black holes]] are often observed by their glowing accretion discs, which are materials spiraling violently around the dense object, heating up and emitting light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. The immense gravity of a [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]] causes light to be bent and distorted around it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Light rays from behind the [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]] can orbit and bend into an observer's eyes, creating a distorted image where the accretion disc appears both in front and behind the [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Einstein's Theory of Relativity and Spacetime Distortion
When approaching a [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]], perceptions of time and space differ greatly between an observer far away and someone falling in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. This is because [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black holes]] distort space and time near them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

### Spacetime is Stretchy
According to [[einsteins_theory_of_relativity_and_black_holes | Albert Einstein's theory]], space and time are fundamentally one thing called spacetime, and spacetime is stretchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Spacetime responds, warps, or curves to matter and energy in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. A [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]] represents the most extreme example of this distortion known to us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. The math indicates that reality very close to a [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]] is not the same as reality far from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

### Different Perspectives at the Event Horizon
For someone falling into a [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]], the universe appears to speed up, while to a distant observer, the faller appears to move in slow motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. As the falling object approaches the event horizon — the point of no return where no light can escape — the distant observer would see time tick more and more slowly for the object, eventually seeing its time stop at the horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. From the outside, nothing ever appears to cross into the [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. The light from the falling object would be stretched, becoming infinitely redshifted as it struggles against the immense gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

For those crossing the event horizon, there's no feeling of a distinct boundary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. However, from their perspective, there's no turning back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | Space]] can be imagined as a river flowing into a "sinkhole" where the river of [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | space]] flows inwards at the speed of light on the horizon and faster than light inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Like a fish swimming against a tide faster than it can swim, a photon (particle of light) cannot escape once inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

## Inside the Black Hole: Spaghettification and the Singularity
Once past the event horizon, the falling object begins to feel something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Gravity increases faster and faster, leading to a phenomenon known as spaghettification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

### Spaghettification
Spaghettification occurs because the distortion in spacetime is not constant over the length of an object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. The gravitational force at one's feet is so dramatically different from that at one's head that the object is stretched and squashed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. As one gets closer to the [[the_mystery_of_singularity_and_the_beginning_of_the_universe | singularity]], these effects become so extreme that the object ceases to stay together, first becoming a long string of atoms, then the atoms themselves separate, followed by protons and quarks, until ultimately everything is ripped apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

### The Singularity: End of Time
All the ripped-apart pieces continue racing inward toward the [[the_mystery_of_singularity_and_the_beginning_of_the_universe | singularity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. While tempting to picture it as an infinitely dense point where a star collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, because a [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]] is a distortion of spacetime, the [[the_mystery_of_singularity_and_the_beginning_of_the_universe | singularity]] is not just a place but also "a moment in time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. In [[einsteins_theory_of_relativity_and_black_holes | Einstein's theory]], it is the end of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. It becomes a future point for anything that crosses the horizon, making escape akin to trying to escape tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

## Beyond Einstein: The Information Paradox
According to [[einsteins_theory_of_relativity_and_black_holes | Einstein's theory]], once ripped to bits and gone into an infinitely distorted space and time, it's simply "done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. However, [[hawking_radiation_and_information_paradox | Stephen Hawking]] discovered that "black holes ain't so black" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

### Hawking Radiation and Information
[[hawking_radiation_and_information_paradox | Stephen Hawking]] discovered that [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black holes]] actually emit what's called [[hawking_radiation_and_information_paradox | Hawking radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. This radiation indicates that [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black holes]] have a temperature, glow, lose energy, and therefore have a lifetime, eventually dissipating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

This led to the [[theories_on_black_hole_information_paradox | information paradox]]. All matter, including what falls into a [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]], ends up at the [[the_mystery_of_singularity_and_the_beginning_of_the_universe | singularity]] at the end of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Yet, every law of the universe states that information is conserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. If a [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]] eventually vanishes, what happens to all the information that fell into it? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a> [[hawking_radiation_and_information_paradox | Hawking's]] initial calculation suggested the radiation was information-free, implying information was erased, which contradicts the laws of nature stating information gets scrambled but not destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

### [[recent_discoveries_and_theories_in_black_hole_physics | Recent Discoveries and Theories]]
[[recent_discoveries_and_theories_in_black_hole_physics | Recent cutting-edge research]] suggests [[hawking_radiation_and_information_paradox | Hawking]] "missed a bit in his calculation," and that the radiation is *not* information-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. Instead, all the information about everything that fell in is imprinted in the radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. This resolves the [[theories_on_black_hole_information_paradox | information paradox]] but presents a new puzzle: how does information that went to the [[the_mystery_of_singularity_and_the_beginning_of_the_universe | singularity]] and the end of time get out again as radiation? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>

Current theories are still developing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. One description proposes that the interior of the [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]] is in some sense the same place as the exterior, possibly involving wormholes opening up from the interior to the exterior, allowing bits of information to "go through the wormholes and coming out again" in the [[hawking_radiation_and_information_paradox | Hawking radiation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. Other theories suggest that one might never truly "go in" or that there is no "in" of a [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black hole]] at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. This points to a description of the universe that resembles a giant quantum computer or a network of entangled qubits, suggesting a deeper, fundamental structure of [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | space]] and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

[[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | Black holes]] are an incredible gift to physics because they stretch the limits of our understanding of the universe, forcing us to confront the very structure of [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | space]] and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. In their strangeness and extremeness, [[the_nature_and_properties_of_black_holes | black holes]] reveal the hidden structure of reality that governs everything, including our everyday lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.

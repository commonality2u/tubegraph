Online voting presents a complex and high-stakes challenge, with cybersecurity at its core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Experts describe the problem as "controversial, complicated and high stakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The fundamental question is whether it can be done safely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## The High Stakes of Election Security

Securing online elections involves protecting the most important well-armed countries in the world as they choose their leaders, and preventing adversaries from influencing these outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This is described as "cyber security on a whole whole other level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

Currently, some select individuals in the U.S., such as military and overseas citizens, vote online, often by emailing or faxing their ballots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Cybersecurity experts caution that this is "not a system that you want a whole country using" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Core Cybersecurity Challenges in Online Voting

Dr. Joe Kiniry and Dr. Josh Benaloh, cybersecurity experts with over 20 years of experience in [[online_voting_technologies_and_solutions | online voting]], outline four basic [[challenges_of_online_voting | challenges to voting online]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### 1. Credentials
Online voting requires "digital credentials" to validate a voter's identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. While countries like Estonia utilize electronic ID cards for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, there has been "extreme resistance to the roll out of a national ID system" in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Even social security numbers are considered a "no go" from a political standpoint for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:05:03]</a>.

### 2. Coercion
Maintaining the secrecy of the ballot is crucial to prevent coercion, such as vote selling or buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. If a voter can log into their phone with facial ID and then hand it to someone else to vote, or obtain a receipt of their vote, it enables manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

Estonia addresses this by allowing voters to recast their vote multiple times online, with only the last vote counting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. This contrasts with online banking, where transactions are part of a public ledger and are not secret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:06:03]</a>.

### 3. Client Malware
A major concern is malware on a voter's device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. With [[online_voting_technologies_and_solutions | internet voting]], every voter's device becomes part of the election's infrastructure, vastly expanding the "attack surface" for hackers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

A primary fear is "vote flipping," where malware on a voter's device changes their intended vote without their knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Unlike online banking or encrypted messaging, the critical difference in voting is the "ability to confirm that things have been done properly" while maintaining a secret ballot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:24]</a>.

#### The Benaloh Challenge
To address the confirmation problem, Dr. Josh Benaloh invented a method called the "Benaloh challenge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:40]</a>. This system allows voters to either submit their encrypted vote or "check" it, proving the system is working as intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:09:07]</a>. If a small percentage of voters (e.g., 1% of 100 million voters) perform checks, the system can statistically prove its integrity, likely catching even a small number of flipped votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:10:02]</a>.

However, a limitation arises if finding a problem on a voter's phone could call an election into question. This could lead to individuals intentionally placing malware on their phones to disrupt or overturn election results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:34]</a>.

### 4. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks
Beyond vote flipping, a significant cybersecurity risk is a "denial of service attack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:49]</a>. The goal of such an attack is to overwhelm a system with fake traffic, causing websites to crash, fail to load properly, or trigger internet outages in specific areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:59]</a>. Even a slowdown for a few hours could be catastrophic, potentially affecting [[potential_impact_of_online_voting_on_voter_turnout | voter turnout]] similarly to how rain influences it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:11:08]</a>. This could allow adversaries to create "online weather" in specific places to subtly influence election outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:15]</a>.

> "Our adversaries are extremely talented. They have unbounded amounts of hackers computers networks and cash." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:33]</a>
> "This story is not about your mom's email scammer. This is about nations trying to influence each other's elections." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:38]</a>

## Beyond Technology: Public Trust

Cybersecurity concerns also intertwine with the broader issue of public trust in voting, which is "not a technological problem" alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:48]</a>. There's "a lot that goes well beyond technology here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:51]</a>.

While progress is being made and constructive discussions about how [[online_voting_technologies_and_solutions | online voting]] might work are ongoing, many problems remain unsolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:13]</a>.

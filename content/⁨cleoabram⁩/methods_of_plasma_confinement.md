[[basics_of_nuclear_fusion | Nuclear fusion]] involves smashing tiny atoms together to create larger atoms, releasing energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. To achieve this, a critical challenge is how to contain and pressurize plasma — a state of matter where individual atoms have broken into bits, with neutrons, electrons, and protons flying around due to immense energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:33">[06:54:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:07">[07:07:07]</a>. Since no material can contain such energetic plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>, various methods have been developed to keep it confined and pressurized long enough for [[using_nuclear_fusion_as_an_energy_source | fusion]] to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:01">[07:31:01]</a>.

## Gravitational Confinement

This method is observed in nature, primarily powering the universe, including the sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>. Gravitational confinement uses immense gravitational forces to pull plasma inward, compressing and heating the fuel to the point where it fuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>. On Earth, however, it is not currently possible to build systems large enough to achieve gravitational confinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>.

## Magnetic Confinement

On Earth, researchers use electronics and magnetic fields to pull plasma inward and keep it contained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>. A common machine used for this method is called a tokamak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>. In a tokamak, fusion plasma circles around, well-confined, until it becomes hot enough to fuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>.

## Inertial Confinement

Inertial confinement is an approach that differs from trying to replicate the sun's continuous fusion process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>. Instead of holding fusion fuel steady, it compresses it very quickly, on the order of a billionth of a second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. This is often achieved by shooting lasers at the plasma to push it together rapidly, leading to quick fusion events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>. This results in "plasma blinks" rather than a continuous plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>.

## Magnetoinertial Confinement

Some companies, like Helion, are exploring hybrid approaches such as magnetoinertial confinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>. This method combines the principles of both magnetic and inertial confinement. It aims to achieve sustained confinement of the fusion fuel, similar to the sun and magnetic confinement, while also incorporating the rapid compression characteristic of inertial confinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>. This process can create a "manmade star" where plasma is ejected, compressed, increases in pressure and temperature, gets brighter, and then expands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>.

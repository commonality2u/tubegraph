[[Quantum computers and their significance | Quantum computers]] are a subject of significant interest, often appearing in news but frequently misunderstood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Unlike supercomputers, [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computers]] are not merely bigger or faster versions of existing technology; they are fundamentally different, designed for distinct tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## A New Kind of Computation

To understand their unique capabilities, an analogy compares [[classical_vs_quantum_computing | classical computers]] to cars and [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computers]] to boats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. While a boat isn't inherently "better" than a car, they are built for different terrain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Similarly, [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computers]] can navigate "new mathematical waters," solving problems and discovering areas that [[classical_vs_quantum_computing | traditional computers]] cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This means a [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computer]] will likely never "beat" an iPhone, as they are not good at common tasks like addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Instead, their strength lies in "finding structure in tons of data" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

The fundamental difference lies in their processing units:
*   **Bits**: [[Classical computers]] use bits, which are pieces of silicon that can exist in one of two states: zero or one (ground or excited) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. All computer data is translated into this binary language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **[[qubits_and_how_they_function | Qubits]]**: [[Quantum computers]] operate on [[qubits_and_how_they_function | qubits]], which are more complex than bits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. A [[qubits_and_how_they_function | qubit]] can have a probability of being zero or one, like a wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. When a [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computer]] operates, the probabilities of multiple [[qubits_and_how_they_function | qubits]] interact, finding the most likely answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. It's a misconception that they "try all the options" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

## The Threat to Encryption

One of the most significant and concerning [[potential_applications_of_quantum_computing | potential applications of quantum computing]] is its ability to break modern encryption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

### Shore's Algorithm
The first major algorithm developed for [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computers]] is Shore's Algorithm, which can efficiently find prime factors for very large numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. This is critical because it forms the basis of RSA encryption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

RSA encryption underpins how most internet transactions are conducted, and its security relies on the fact that it is practically impossible for [[classical_vs_quantum_computing | classical algorithms]] to crack it through brute force, taking billions of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. However, a [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computer]] could perform this task far more efficiently, potentially in hours to days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

### The Global Race
This capability has sparked a "global race" among governments to develop [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | practical quantum computers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. Whoever first achieves this would gain a tremendous advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Current State and Future Outlook

Currently, [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computers]] are not yet capable of breaking all internet security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Breaking RSA encryption would likely require a million or more [[qubits_and_how_they_function | qubits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. As of a recent record set by IBM, the largest [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computer]] has 433 [[qubits_and_how_they_function | qubits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

Despite the significant difference between 433 and a million [[qubits_and_how_they_function | qubits]], experts are confident that this threshold will be reached sooner than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. It is anticipated that within five years, or even less, there will be a transition to "quantum safe algorithms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. This means RSA encryption will likely be phased out gradually in favor of quantum-safe alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

The field is progressing at an incredibly fast rate, solving problems that were incomprehensible just a few years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. As there are no fundamental mathematical or physical barriers, engineers are expected to find ways to continuously improve the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. This ongoing advancement suggests that the [[potential_applications_of_quantum_computing | applications of quantum computing]] are a "bottomless ocean" yet to be fully explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

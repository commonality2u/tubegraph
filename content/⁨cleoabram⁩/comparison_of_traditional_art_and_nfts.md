The contemporary art world has seen significant shifts in how value is perceived and assigned, particularly with the emergence of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). While many questions about NFTs revolve around their perceived high price, often countered by the argument "I can just screenshot that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, a deeper understanding reveals that these questions are not new, but rather echoes of long-standing debates within the art community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## The Evolution of Art Valuation

Understanding the value of [[understanding_nfts_and_their_value | NFTs]] requires examining the "incredibly strange way we value art to begin with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### The 1973 Sotheby's Auction
A pivotal moment in the art world occurred on October 18, 1973, when collectors Robert and Ethel Scull hosted an auction at Sotheby's in New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This event marked the first time that works by living artists sold for "many tens of millions of dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This development was met with significant backlash, with people hating it for many of the same reasons they criticize NFTs today: it felt like an uncomfortable "marriage between art and money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

A famous incident involved artist Robert Rauschenberg, who got into a fistfight at the auction because he "couldn't believe the price at which his work was trading" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Rauschenberg had originally sold his art for $900, only to see it later auction for $85,000, without receiving any of that profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This event, where art prices "exploded forever," became a turning point in how art was valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### The Rise of Artist Celebrity
According to David Galperin, Head of Contemporary Art for the Americas at Sotheby’s, this period was when "living artists became [[impact_of_celebrity_culture_on_art_prices | celebrities]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Andy Warhol, in particular, was instrumental in this shift, using "celebrity as his medium" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. When art became less about the physical object and more about the artist's personal celebrity or the concepts behind the work, it became "untethered from other benchmarks of value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The value shifted from "how much did that cost you to make?" or "how long did it take you?" to "How much is that idea worth?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### Redefining Art and Originality
Since the 1970s, the market has "entirely exploded," and with it, "the very idea of what art IS exploded too" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Art can now manifest as:
*   Text phrases in public places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>
*   A pile of candy slowly eaten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>
*   A banana taped to a wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>
*   Even instructions for the buyer to make the art themselves, as exemplified by Sol LeWitt's wall drawings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

Artists like Andy Warhol deliberately toyed with the notion of originality and copies. Warhol famously stated, "I think it would be great if more people took up silk screens so that no one would know whether my picture was mine or someone else's" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. The appropriation artist Elaine Sturtevant further explored these ideas by copying works by Warhol and Jasper Johns, with Warhol even giving her his silkscreen to facilitate her appropriations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. For Warhol, the question of "what is original and what is a copy?" was integral to understanding his art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## NFTs: The Digital Evolution of Art Value

NFTs are a form of digital art that utilize [[role_of_blockchain_technology_in_nfts | blockchain technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. While the technology itself is often explained, the core question for many remains how they can be so expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Value in Concept and Ownership
In contemporary art, especially conceptual art, the physical object might not be the artwork itself. For instance, with Sol LeWitt's wall drawings, the "artwork is the certificate. Without the certificate, the artwork has no value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. This concept directly relates to NFTs. The argument "I can just screenshot that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a> misses the point that the value in an NFT, much like LeWitt's drawings, lies in the ownership credential—the unique entry in a database that signifies who owns it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

### The Role of Consensus and Blockchain
The reason NFTs have gained traction now, as opposed to earlier digital images, is the existence of a database that "some critical mass of people agree to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This database typically uses [[role_of_blockchain_technology_in_nfts | blockchain technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. As investor Alexis Ohanian explains, "as long as there is a critical mass of people who believe in it, that is the only database that matters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Therefore, while one can "right-click save" an image, it does not grant ownership within the agreed-upon database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. The value of an NFT, then, is tied to this verifiable ownership within a collectively agreed-upon system, making it more than "just a link to an image" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### Practical Applications and Value Beyond Aesthetics
NFTs can also offer additional utility beyond aesthetic appreciation or conceptual ownership. For example, some NFTs function as tickets to events, adding another layer of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

### The Flexible Idea of Value
The concept of value, even for traditional art, is incredibly flexible. An example illustrating this is the MSCHF art collective's project involving an Andy Warhol drawing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. MSCHF bought a Warhol drawing for about $20,000, made 999 exact copies, mixed the original with the copies, and sold each for $250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Most people would likely pay more if they could identify the original, especially if it came with a "certificate of some kind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, suggesting that verifiable originality adds value, whether for personal appreciation or resale.

## Conclusion: A New Canvas Reflecting Old Questions

NFTs are "a shiny new thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a> that brings long-standing questions about art value "more into the public sphere by taking things to an extreme" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. The fundamental equation of art value remains the same, but NFTs introduce elements like "more money," "no physical product," and "anyone decides," making the "math come out all wonky" for some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

Despite the discomfort around high prices for digital images, NFTs are part of the "much larger context of art itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. They represent "a new medium" and a "new canvas" for artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, offering a fresh perspective on the fundamental questions that have shaped art valuation for decades: "What is value? Where does it come from? What is too much, for too little?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. In this new digital art form, we see "our own reflection more clearly than we did before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, ultimately revealing the inherent value of art itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

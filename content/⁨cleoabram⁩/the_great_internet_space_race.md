A "Great Internet Space Race" is underway, with multiple billionaires aiming to launch [[starlink_and_satellite_internet | internet]] into space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Key players include Elon Musk with [[starlink_and_satellite_internet | Starlink]], Jeff Bezos's Project Kuiper, and Richard Branson's OneWeb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This initiative is particularly relevant as [[starlink_and_satellite_internet | Starlink]] has recently been made available in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. These new satellite systems have the potential to change how millions of people access the internet globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Current Internet Infrastructure: Underwater Cables

For most people, the internet is not in space; it's [[underwater_internet_cables | underwater]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The internet relies on over 800,000 miles of cables that criss-cross oceans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. As of 2021, there were approximately 436 active [[underwater_internet_cables | cables]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, carrying an estimated 99% of current international internet traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

These [[underwater_internet_cables | cables]] transmit binary information (1s and 0s) as flashes of light through tiny glass fibers across oceans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Laying these cables involves specialized ships that travel slowly, around 6 knots (7 miles per hour), taking weeks to weave a literal web around the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The cables are laid all the way to the ocean floor, even in deep parts, though the deepest trenches are avoided due to the difficulty and expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

Despite the reality, many people mistakenly believe the internet is in space, influenced by terms like "the cloud," "upload," and "download" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The existing [[underwater_internet_cables | internet infrastructure]] is considered a marvel of human ingenuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## Why the Shift to Space?

The concept of communications satellites isn't new; Telstar 1, the first communications satellite, launched in 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. While fiber optic cables use visible light, satellites convert binary information into radio waves for transmission up and down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. This conversion can be done by changing the amplitude (height) or frequency (length) of the waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Historically, cables have been faster, cheaper, and more reliable than satellite internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

### Key Internet Terms

*   **Bandwidth**: The amount of data that can pass through in a set period, measured in megabits per second (Mbps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. A "bit" is a single 1 or 0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Latency**: The time it takes for an information stream to travel from one end to another, measured in milliseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Better Internet**: Characterized by high bandwidth and low latency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Addressing the [[digital_divide_and_internet_accessibility | Digital Divide]]

The primary motivation for new [[starlink_and_satellite_internet | satellite internet]] projects is that existing infrastructure, while impressive, is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Many people lack access to good internet due to:
*   **Difficulty in laying cables**: Prohibitively challenging in some geographical areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Threats to ground-based service**: Political instability or war, as seen in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Financial viability**: Companies may not lay cables in rural areas if there aren't enough paying customers, leading to higher costs where service is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

This disparity in internet access is known as the [[digital_divide_and_internet_accessibility | Digital Divide]], which exists globally and within countries, between cities and rural communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Data from sources like the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) may significantly underestimate the problem, as their reporting method can count an entire census block as having broadband if only one person has access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Given the internet's importance for societal participation, solving the [[digital_divide_and_internet_accessibility | digital divide]]—encompassing both accessibility and affordability—is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

## The Promise of New Satellite Systems

New satellite internet companies aim to address the [[digital_divide_and_internet_accessibility | digital divide]] by providing broadband everywhere, including to the approximately 4 billion people currently without it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. While driven by business opportunities (the broadband market is estimated at $30 billion annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>, these companies can also make a significant social impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

Unlike older satellite systems (like HughesNet and Viasat), which use high, stationary satellites to cover large areas (but suffer from high latency due to signal travel time), new projects are deploying many more satellites in lower orbits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This reduces latency but requires a larger constellation to cover the same area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

In this "space race," [[starlink_and_satellite_internet | Starlink]] is currently leading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. [[starlink_and_satellite_internet | Starlink]] offers surprisingly high bandwidth and low latency for a satellite system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. It uses visible light for inter-satellite communication, similar to [[underwater_internet_cables | fiber optic cables]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. This gives [[starlink_and_satellite_internet | Starlink]] a theoretical advantage over cables because light travels faster in the vacuum of space than through glass cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. While [[starlink_and_satellite_internet | Starlink]] may surpass fiber in some niche areas, fiber is expected to remain dominant in most places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

## Concerns: [[impacts_of_satellite_internet_on_astronomy | Impacts on Astronomy]]

The proliferation of thousands of new satellites, like those in the [[starlink_and_satellite_internet | Starlink]] constellation, poses a significant threat to ground-based astronomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. The satellites can interfere with observations crucial for understanding the universe and for planetary defense against asteroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. A balance is needed to provide global internet access while protecting the ability to observe the cosmos, potentially through better data sharing on satellite positions or new regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

## The Broader Impact

These companies have the potential to provide better, faster, and cheaper internet to people worldwide, already proving valuable in crises, such as [[starlink_and_satellite_internet | Starlink]]'s activation in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. The most significant impact occurs when technology makes services not only faster and better but also cheaper, transforming luxuries into commodities accessible to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

Research indicates that increased internet access correlates with job growth, the formation of new businesses, reduced unemployment, and improved health and education outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. New satellite systems, combined with continued investment in existing infrastructure, could play a vital role in further expanding these benefits globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

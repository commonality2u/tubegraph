The internet, a marvel of human ingenuity, is currently undergoing a significant transformation driven by a new "Great Internet Space Race" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This race involves multiple billionaires, including Jeff Bezos with Project Kuiper, Elon Musk with [[starlink_and_satellite_internet | Starlink]], and Richard Branson with OneWeb, all vying to provide global internet access from space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This endeavor has become particularly relevant as [[starlink_and_satellite_internet | Starlink]] was recently made available in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. These systems have the potential to redefine how millions access the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Current Internet Infrastructure: The Underwater Web

For most people, the internet is not in space; it's underwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The vast majority of international internet traffic, estimated up to 99%, is carried by over 800,000 miles of fiber optic cables that criss-cross our oceans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. As of 2021, approximately 436 such cables were in service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

These cables transmit information as flashes of light, converting binary "1s and 0s" into light signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This process involves rapidly turning light on and off in code through tiny glass fibers across oceans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Laying these cables is a laborious process, with specialized ships crossing oceans at speeds of about 7 miles per hour, taking weeks to weave this literal web around the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

> [!INFO] Cable Laying Challenges
> A common question is how these cables traverse the deepest parts of the ocean, which can be deeper than Mount Everest is tall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Cable-laying companies confirm they do not build bridges or let cables hang. Instead, they lay enough cable for it to fall all the way to the bottom, a process that is difficult and expensive, leading them to avoid the deepest trenches where possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

Despite its complexity and scale, many people mistakenly believe the internet is in space, partly due to common terminology like "the cloud" or "upload/download" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## Why the Race to Space? Addressing the [[digital_divide_and_accessibility_of_internet | Digital Divide]]

The primary motivation behind the push for satellite internet is that while existing infrastructure is remarkable, it is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

Key [[challenges_of_existing_internet_infrastructure | challenges of existing internet infrastructure]] include:
-   **Prohibitive difficulty** in laying cables in some geographic locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
-   **Vulnerability** to political actions or war, as seen in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
-   **Financial non-viability** for companies to lay cables in rural or sparsely populated areas, leading to higher costs for consumers in those regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

This leads to the "[[digital_divide_and_accessibility_of_internet | Digital Divide]]" – a significant disparity in internet access and affordability globally, between urban and rural communities, and even within communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Data from sources like the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) may vastly underestimate the problem, showing 14 million people without fast internet, while other estimates, like Microsoft's, indicate over 120 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. This divide is a critical issue given the internet's importance for participation in modern society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

The "Great Internet Space Race" aims to solve this problem by providing broadband access to "the roughly 4 billion people on Earth who don’t yet have it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. While companies are motivated by the business opportunity (a $30 billion annual market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>), addressing this need can also be a profound good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

## Satellite Internet: A New Frontier

The concept of communications satellites dates back to Telstar 1, launched in 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Unlike fiber optics that use visible light, satellites convert binary "1s and 0s" into radio waves for transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This is achieved by modulating wave characteristics like amplitude (height) or frequency (length) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

Traditional satellite internet systems, like HughesNet and Viasat, use high-altitude, stationary satellites that cover vast areas, but result in very high latency (the time it takes for information to travel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

New projects, notably [[starlink_and_satellite_internet | Starlink]], are deploying satellites in much lower orbits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. This reduces latency but requires a significantly larger number of satellites to cover the same area, as they need to orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

Among the new contenders, Elon Musk's [[starlink_and_satellite_internet | Starlink]] is currently leading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. [[starlink_and_satellite_internet | Starlink]] is designed for high bandwidth (amount of data that can pass through) and low latency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. A "bit" is a single 1 or 0, and high bandwidth can mean hundreds of millions of 1s and 0s per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Crucially, [[starlink_and_satellite_internet | Starlink]] uses visible light between its satellites, similar to fiber cables, giving it a potential speed advantage because light travels faster in the vacuum of space than in a glass cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. While [[starlink_and_satellite_internet | Starlink]] is in its infancy and faces challenges like signal interruption by trees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, it could potentially challenge fiber optic cables in terms of performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Implications

### [[impact_of_starlink_on_groundbased_astronomy | Impact on Ground-Based Astronomy]]
A significant concern with the proliferation of low-Earth orbit satellites, particularly the tens of thousands planned, is their [[impact_of_starlink_on_groundbased_astronomy | interference with ground-based astronomy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. These satellites can obstruct observations crucial for understanding the universe and for planetary defense against asteroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Solutions may involve more data on satellite locations to allow avoidance or stricter regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

### Transforming Society
The real impact of this "Great Internet Space Race" hinges on whether these companies can make internet access not only better and faster but also **cheaper** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. When technology transforms luxuries into commodities, making them accessible to everyone, it has a world-changing effect, as seen with refrigerators and iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.

Widespread internet access is linked to significant societal benefits:
-   Increased job growth and new business formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
-   Lower unemployment rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.
-   Improved health outcomes and access to education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

New satellite systems, alongside continued investment in existing infrastructure, are crucial for achieving these goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. The internet, a testament to human connection and ingenuity, is not yet finished, and the developments in space are poised to play a major role in its ongoing evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

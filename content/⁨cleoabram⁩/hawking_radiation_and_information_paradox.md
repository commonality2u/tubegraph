The behavior of [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black holes]] challenges our fundamental understanding of the universe, particularly regarding the conservation of information. While [[einsteins_theory_of_relativity_and_black_holes | Einstein's theory of relativity]] suggests nothing can escape a [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black hole]] once it crosses the [[the_concept_of_event_horizons_and_spaghettification | event horizon]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, Stephen Hawking's discoveries revealed a more complex reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

## [[hawking_radiation_and_black_hole_evaporation | Hawking Radiation]]

Stephen Hawking discovered that [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black holes]] are not entirely "black" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. According to his calculations, something *does* escape them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. This phenomenon, known as [[hawking_radiation_and_black_hole_evaporation | Hawking radiation]], is emitted from the [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black hole]] as particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

This radiation signifies that [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black holes]] possess a temperature, meaning they glow and lose energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. Consequently, [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black holes]] have a finite lifetime and will eventually evaporate entirely, leaving behind only the [[hawking_radiation_and_black_hole_evaporation | Hawking radiation]] they emitted over eons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

## [[the_information_paradox_and_the_future_of_black_hole_research | The Information Paradox]]

The concept of [[hawking_radiation_and_black_hole_evaporation | Hawking radiation]] led to a significant puzzle known as [[the_information_paradox_and_the_future_of_black_hole_research | the information paradox]]. If matter and energy fall into a [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black hole]], eventually reaching the [[inner_workings_of_black_holes | singularity]] where it is "ripped apart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a> and ceases to exist as it once did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>, and the [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black hole]] later evaporates, what happens to the information contained within that matter? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>

The core of the paradox lies in the conflict between two fundamental principles:
*   **Information Conservation** Our current laws of physics state that information is always conserved; it can be scrambled but never truly destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.
*   **Hawking's Initial Calculation** Stephen Hawking's initial calculation suggested that [[hawking_radiation_and_black_hole_evaporation | Hawking radiation]] was "information free" and purely thermal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. This would imply that any information about what fell into the [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black hole]] would be erased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

This discrepancy "bothered everybody" in the scientific community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

### Recent Developments

Research published in 2019 suggests a potential resolution to this paradox. These papers indicate that Hawking's initial calculation may have missed a subtle detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. It now appears that [[hawking_radiation_and_black_hole_evaporation | Hawking radiation]] is *not* information-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. Instead, the information about everything that fell into the [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black hole]] is imprinted in the radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

While this preserves information, it introduces a new conceptual challenge: how does information, which went to the [[inner_workings_of_black_holes | singularity]] at the "end of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>, manage to get outside again as radiation? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>

### Ongoing Research and Theories

The exact mechanism by which this information escapes is still a subject of active and cutting-edge research, with no universally agreed-upon picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. Some speculative ideas include:
*   **Wormholes** The interior of the [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black hole]] might be connected to its exterior via wormholes, allowing information to pass through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.
*   **Quantum Computer Universe** There's a description of the universe that resembles a giant [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computer]], a network of entangled qubits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. This perspective might offer new ways to understand how information behaves under extreme conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.
*   **No Interior** Some theories even propose that there is no true "inside" to a [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black hole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.

These investigations into [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black holes]] push the boundaries of our understanding of [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | space and time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. They provide unique insights into the fundamental structure of reality, even hinting at connections between astrophysical phenomena and concepts like [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computers]] and quantum information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

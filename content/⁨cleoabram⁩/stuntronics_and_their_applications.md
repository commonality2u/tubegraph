Stuntronics are robot stunt doubles developed by Walt Disney Imagineering to perform feats that would be unsafe or impossible for human stunt performers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. These robots are a cutting-edge example of technology used not for utility but to enhance storytelling and create immersive experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>, aiming to make guests "feel something" and connect with characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

## Development Process

The creation of stuntronics involved an iterative process of experimentation and refinement:
*   Initially, engineers "flung a metal stick with some motors and actuators" repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
*   Through hundreds of repetitions, tracking results, and improving control of motion, the robot's movements were gradually made more human-like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.
*   "Mini Man" is an example of an earlier, smaller version used in this development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.
*   This approach is somewhat akin to the [[training_and_design_of_disney_droids | training and design of Disney droids]] which also involved extensive simulation and refinement of movement.

## Current Applications

Stuntronics are currently used for:
*   **Theme Park Performances** The primary application mentioned is enabling a "larger than life Spider-Man performance" at Disneyland, where the robot launches over the park, pulling "like 10 G's" – a force too high for a human stunt performer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. This allows for flips that would otherwise only be achievable through CGI in movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

## Potential Future Applications

Imagineers are open to using stuntronics for "all sorts of uses" beyond theme parks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. A potential future application includes:
*   **Movie Production** Stuntronics could theoretically be used in films to perform stunts that are too dangerous or difficult for human actors, similar to how sets from Marvel films are preserved for potential use in parks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

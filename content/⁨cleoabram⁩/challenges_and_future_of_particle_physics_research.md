Particle physics research aims to understand the fundamental fabric of the universe by studying elementary particles, the indivisible building blocks of all matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. This endeavor involves massive experiments and significant global collaboration.

## The Large Hadron Collider (LHC)

The [[Large Hadron Collider LHC at CERN | Large Hadron Collider (LHC)]] at CERN, located on the border between France and Switzerland, is the largest science experiment ever built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It is a 27-kilometer-long tunnel, situated more than 100 meters underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Inside, two pipes are kept colder and emptier than outer space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Scientists fire particles smaller than atoms, specifically protons, in opposite directions through these pipes, accelerating them to nearly the speed of light before smashing them together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

The LHC took thousands of people from over a hundred countries, $5 billion, and more than 30 years to plan and build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Its construction involved lowering components down a shaft and assembling them in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The beam pipes themselves are about the diameter of an orange, with thousands of magnets forcing particles into a space the width of a human hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Protons, which are to the width of a hair as a grain of salt is to the entire Earth, are squeezed into this tiny space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

To achieve collisions, bunches of 100 billion protons are fired in each direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. On average, only 50 to 60 collisions occur per crossing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, so the process is repeated 30 million times per second, resulting in approximately 1 billion collisions per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Purpose of Particle Colliders

The [[purpose_and_significance_of_particle_colliders | purpose and significance of particle colliders]] like the LHC is to glimpse what might have happened near the beginning of our universe, the Big Bang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Colliding protons at high speeds releases enormous energy that can turn into physical mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. If the energy is high enough, it can produce mysterious or unknown particles, which are additional building blocks of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. These special particles exist only for an instant before decaying into everyday particles that are then recorded by detectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Scientists analyze these "crime scenes" to reverse engineer what occurred at the moment of collision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### The Standard Model and the Higgs Boson

Particle physicists aim to understand the fabric of the universe by dividing matter until they reach elementary particles, which are the fundamental building blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. Our current understanding is described by the Standard Model, a mathematical framework that explains how the world works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

The Standard Model predicted the existence of a mystery particle, the Higgs Boson (or "God Particle"), which had never been detected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. This particle was considered of "vital importance to universal existence" because it would confirm the existence of an underlying field that gives other particles mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Discovering the Higgs Boson was crucial for understanding "why stuff exists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

The LHC was built with enough energy to create the Higgs Boson by smashing protons together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. After two years of collecting data, scientists at CERN reliably created and detected the Higgs Boson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. The confirmation of its existence appeared as a "bump on a chart," showing that more particles were produced at a specific energy level, thus proving the math was right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### Impact of Discoveries

While the confirmation of the Higgs Boson didn't immediately change the world for everyday people, it validated our understanding of the universe and demonstrated that humanity is "on the right track" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Fundamental discoveries in physics, like Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion, lead to unforeseen future applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. The goal is to discover the building blocks now so future generations can build with them in unimaginable ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. The better we understand how particles work, the more we can create technologies that change our lives in 20, 30, or 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Directions

The [[large_hadron_collider_lhc_at_cern | Large Hadron Collider]] has significantly shaped our understanding of elementary particle interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. However, some scientists argue that it may have reached its limit for new discoveries, and there are still significant mysteries about the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

### The Call for a Bigger Collider

Many scientists advocate for building a much larger particle collider to address the "big holes in our understanding of the universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. The proposed next-generation collider is provisionally named the Future Circular Collider (FCC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. This new collider is estimated to cost roughly $17 billion and would be a 100-kilometer loop, significantly larger than the LHC's 27 km <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Other proposals include a muon collider, a linear collider, and a powerful collider in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

### Unanswered Questions: Dark Matter

One of the major unanswered questions is the nature of dark matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. This "invisible matter" accounts for 27% of our universe, and we know it exists because it gravitationally impacts things we can see, such as the way light bends as it passes galaxies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. While there is no guarantee, a bigger collider *might* help us learn about dark matter or uncover something entirely unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

### Debate and Justification for Investment

Not everyone agrees that a new, larger collider is worth the investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Some argue that the LHC fell short of certain expectations, and predictions suggest that even the FCC might not have enough energy to produce truly new discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

However, proponents argue that pure science done at CERN has already yielded significant [[impacts_of_cern_research_on_technology and society | technological and societal impacts]] as byproducts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. These include:
*   New therapies for cancer treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>
*   Better medical imaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>
*   More efficient electric cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>
*   More sensitive radiation detectors for space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>
*   The World Wide Web, initially developed for scientists to communicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>

It is emphasized that investment in fundamental research is not a "false choice" compared to applied research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. Fundamental research is essential foundational "kindergarten" knowledge for any future applied research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. The future often sounds like science fiction until it is built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.

### Philosophical Implications

Ultimately, what humanity chooses to spend its time on reflects its values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. Building enormous monuments dedicated to knowledge, like particle colliders, demonstrates a species that seeks to learn, tries to do better, and aches to understand its place in a vast universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. Despite human limitations and conflicts, the effort put into fundamental research today can lead to a world we can barely imagine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

The Kola Superdeep Borehole was a project undertaken by the USSR, digging a hole deeper than the deepest part of the ocean and taller than Mount Everest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Project Overview
The drilling began in the 1970s, conceived as an "underground space race" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. While the United States' similar project only reached 600 ft before funding was pulled, the USSR continued for 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The project ultimately penetrated about a third of the way through Earth's crust before stopping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

The Kola Superdeep Borehole reached a depth of 12.2 km, making it the deepest point humans have ever dug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. No humans were sent down the hole; the equipment was operated remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. To achieve such depths, scientists had to invent new equipment and drilling methods capable of piercing thick, hot, pressurized rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Discoveries and Challenges
During the drilling process, the project yielded significant discoveries:
*   New fossilized organisms dating back 2 billion years were found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   Water was discovered much deeper than scientists had previously believed possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

Despite these achievements, further progress proved difficult. One of the scientists involved in the project stated that attempts to dig past the maximum depth repeatedly failed because "each time the New Hole tended to collapse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Legacy
The Kola Superdeep Borehole is considered a "moonshot which will never be repeated or surpassed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Despite its impressive depth, this deepest human-dug hole only accounts for 0.2% of the total distance to the Earth's center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

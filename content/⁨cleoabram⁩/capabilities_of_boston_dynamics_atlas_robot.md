[[development_of_humanoid_robots_by_companies | Atlas]], a well-known robot developed by [[development_of_humanoid_robots_by_companies | Boston Dynamics]], is famed for its parkour abilities and object manipulation in videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. It represents a significant effort across various companies to build human-resembling machines that can walk on two legs and use arms and hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Understanding [[development_of_humanoid_robots_by_companies | Atlas]] provides insight into the broader field of [[development_of_humanoid_robots_by_companies | humanoid robots]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Anatomy and Design

[[development_of_humanoid_robots_by_companies | Atlas]] has eyes in the expected head location, providing visual input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. However, its "brain" consists of three computers, each equivalent to a powerful laptop, located within its chest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

The current version of [[development_of_humanoid_robots_by_companies | Atlas]] stands 4 feet 11 inches (1.5 meters) tall, roughly the height of an average American 12-year-old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Earlier [[development_of_humanoid_robots_by_companies | Boston Dynamics]] robots were larger, but smaller models are perceived as more endearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### Why a Humanoid Form?
The primary reason for building human-shaped robots is that the world is designed for humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. A humanoid form factor is considered effective for systems aiming to address current limitations in automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

These robots are being developed to perform tasks that are:
*   Unsafe for humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   Repetitive or boring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   Located in hard-to-access places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

Legs are particularly crucial for [[development_of_humanoid_robots_by_companies | humanoid robots]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. While many robots use wheels, legs provide greater access and the ability to navigate diverse environments such as stairs, ladders, woods, or crumbling buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. [[development_of_humanoid_robots_by_companies | NASA]]'s Valkyrie robot, for example, is intended for space exploration, which involves highly uncertain terrain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

## Demonstrated Abilities

[[development_of_humanoid_robots_by_companies | Atlas]] showcases a range of impressive physical capabilities:
*   **Running** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>
*   **Jumping** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>
*   **Rolling** (demonstrated with more grace than a human) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>
*   **Standing Backflips** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>
*   **Balance and Recovery:** [[development_of_humanoid_robots_by_companies | Atlas]] can maintain its balance even when forcefully shoved, recovering in a manner similar to a human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. In a direct comparison, [[development_of_humanoid_robots_by_companies | Atlas]] recovered more effectively than a human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

The robot's ability to handle unexpected events was also observed in [[development_of_humanoid_robots_by_companies | Tesla]]'s Optimus demo, where it seamlessly corrected a fallen block and adapted to blocks being moved around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

## The Paradox of Robot Capabilities

Despite its impressive feats like backflips, [[development_of_humanoid_robots_by_companies | Atlas]] can struggle with seemingly simple tasks like sitting in a chair or jogging slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

> [!INFO] Moravec's Paradox
> This phenomenon is explained by **Moravec's Paradox**, a principle often cited in robotics: "the easy things are hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. What humans take for granted in movement and object interaction, such as simple low-performance interactive behaviors, are extremely difficult for robots to execute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Therefore, assumptions about a robot's overall capability based on one impressive feat (e.g., if it can do a backflip, it must be able to jog slowly) do not apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

## Intelligence and Learning

When [[development_of_humanoid_robots_by_companies | Atlas]] performs a task like throwing a bag, it is typically given a high-level goal (e.g., "get this bag to end up over there, while performing a 180-degree turn") rather than pre-planned, limb-by-limb movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. The robot must then figure out the complex coordination required, like how to grab, accelerate, jump, and release the bag according to physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. This requires significant computation to adapt to factors like the inertia of the object being thrown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

### Role of [[advantages_and_risks_of_ai_technology | AI]] and Machine Learning
[[development_of_humanoid_robots_by_companies | Atlas]]'s perception system is almost entirely driven by [[advantages_and_risks_of_ai_technology | machine learning]], allowing it to identify objects and localize itself using cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Other types of [[advantages_and_risks_of_ai_technology | machine learning]] are used to generate behavior, where systems learn to perform tasks better through simulation, robot data, and trial-and-error, rather than painstaking human-engineered control systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

[[development_of_humanoid_robots_by_companies | Tesla]]'s Optimus robot, for example, uses a neural network to process visual information and "decide" how to accomplish tasks like sorting blocks fully autonomously after being given a goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

Currently, [[development_of_humanoid_robots_by_companies | Atlas]] does not automatically learn from every new experience or failure; improvements come through human engineers changing its programming based on hardware experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

For [[development_of_humanoid_robots_by_companies | robots]] to become useful in daily tasks, they will need to understand increasingly high-level concepts and commands, such as "put my groceries away" instead of step-by-step instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. This requires understanding context (e.g., "away" means "in the cabinet, not out the window") and maintaining other priorities (e.g., "don't step on my dog!") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.

## Ethical Stance and Future Impact

[[development_of_humanoid_robots_by_companies | Boston Dynamics]] has taken a strong stance against the weaponization of general-purpose robots, collaborating with Massachusetts legislators to propose bans on such technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. [[development_of_humanoid_robots_by_companies | Elon Musk]] reportedly shares a similar view, seeking to avoid a "Terminator scenario" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

As [[development_of_humanoid_robots_by_companies | humanoid robots]] become more capable, they are envisioned to help humans by performing undesirable tasks, allowing people to choose the work they want to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. The inherent difference in how humans perceive [[development_of_humanoid_robots_by_companies | humanoid robots]] compared to other automated systems, due to their human-like appearance, makes them both more scary and more lovable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.

The future envisions [[development_of_humanoid_robots_by_companies | humanoid robots]] walking among us, assisting with daily tasks like groceries, building, or performing dangerous jobs like entering burning buildings or exploring the moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. This progress will prompt questions about what humans want to do and what they are willing to yield to machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

The Fourth Agricultural Revolution represents a crucial period in food history, characterized by the integration of advanced technologies into farming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This ongoing transformation utilizes innovations such as laser weeders, grain bin robots, and [[selfdriving_tractors_and_farm_automation | self-driving tractors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Driving Force: Population Growth and Food Demand
The impetus for this revolution is the urgent need to address the challenge of an exploding global population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Current projections indicate that by 2050, food production must increase by over 50% to meet the demands of a larger population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. While the global population was approximately 230 million people 2,000 years ago, it now stands at 8.1 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Experts predict it will reach 9 billion in the next 12 years and peak at 10.3 billion by 2084 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Despite the amount of land per person used for food having significantly decreased, advancements in farming tools have enabled greater efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## A History of Agricultural Revolutions
To understand the Fourth Agricultural Revolution, it's important to look back at its predecessors:
*   **First Agricultural Revolution:** This period marked the invention of farming and the transition from foraging, forming the foundation of modern civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Second Agricultural Revolution:** As civilization grew, farming industrialized, becoming a "big business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Third Agricultural Revolution (Green Revolution):** From 1950 to 1970, this revolution addressed widespread hunger and potential famine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. It introduced new chemicals to control pests and weeds and popularized "monocropping" – focusing resources on a single plant per field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. While saving lives, monocropping came at a cost, contributing to soil degradation, health problems from pesticides and herbicides, and strain on water resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Five Steps to Feed the World Sustainably
Experts suggest a five-step approach to feeding an additional 2 billion people while addressing past solutions' problems:

### Step One: Freeze Land Use
Historically, increasing food production meant clearing more land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, with an area the size of South America already cleared for agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Future food production must primarily come from existing land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### Step Two: Grow More on Existing Land
Achieving higher yields on current farmland involves controversial, yet potentially necessary, advancements:
*   **Farm Robots:** Robotics can increase the speed and efficiency of farm work, adapting to various weather conditions and times of day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. While controversial due to potential impacts on farm labor, which is often underpaid and mistreated, robots can also help address labor shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Robots are already performing tasks once thought impossible, such as picking soft fruits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Smarter Mega Machines:** Large agricultural machines are becoming more intelligent and automated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
    *   **[[selfdriving_tractors_and_farm_automation | Self-Driving Tractors]]:** These tractors can operate autonomously, following pre-programmed routes and avoiding obstacles using cameras and sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Farmers can manage multiple machines remotely via a phone, creating detailed routes with precise GPS accuracy (within 1 inch) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
    *   **[[precision_agriculture_and_technology | Precision Agriculture]]:** Enabled by AI and ultra-precise GPS, this technology generates efficient field paths, reducing "dead spots" (missed areas) and "overlap" (areas hit twice), thereby maximizing output and optimizing resource use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
    *   **High-Speed Planters:** Machines can plant up to 720 seeds per second, taking individual seeds from a large container, scanning them with sensors, dropping them at the perfect depth, and recording their placement with cameras and lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. This precise control over seed spacing and depth can increase crop yield by up to 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Step Three: Use Resources More Wisely
This step emphasizes optimizing the use of fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides.
*   **"See and Spray" Technology:** Large machines, like the 120-foot wide, 18-ton "See and Spray," use computer vision and machine learning (powered by Nvidia GPUs) to map millions of crops and visually identify weeds in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Instead of spraying an entire field, this technology applies a tiny squirt of herbicide only to identified weeds, dramatically reducing chemical use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
*   **Laser and Brute Force Weeding:** Some advanced tools eliminate chemicals entirely by using lasers to kill weeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a> or physical force to destroy them, both based on visual recognition systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
*   **Reviving Intercropping:** By knowing the needs of every plant in a field, [[precision_agriculture_and_technology | precision agriculture]] could enable the return of "intercropping" – planting different kinds of plants in the same field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. This older, more [[sustainable_farming_practices_and_challenges | sustainable]] farming method keeps the soil healthy, but could be brought back using new machine learning technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

### Step Four: Shift Our Diets
Currently, only 55% of the world's crop calories directly feed people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. The rest primarily feeds livestock, which is a less efficient way to convert calories into food for humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

### Step Five: Cut Down on Food Waste
Approximately 25% of the world's total food calories are lost or wasted before consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. Reducing this waste is critical for feeding the global population.

## Challenges and Future Outlook
Despite the promise of [[emerging_technologies_impacting_the_future | technology]] in the Fourth Agricultural Revolution, significant challenges persist. These include concerns about how increased automation impacts existing jobs and transforms the nature of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Farmers also face difficulties repairing and maintaining high-tech equipment, leading to the "right to repair" movement, which advocates for farmers' freedom to fix their own machinery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. This issue is not unique to agriculture, appearing in other industries like cars and phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

Ultimately, humanity needs to find solutions to feed 10 billion people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. The Fourth Agricultural Revolution, alongside shifts in diet and reductions in waste, aims to achieve this goal by continuously improving how food is grown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

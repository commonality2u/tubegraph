Over the past two years, the show "Huge If True" has explored various new technologies that possess the potential to alter the world, including [[development_of_humanoid_robots_by_companies | humanoid robots]] and [[quantum_computers_and_their_significance | quantum computers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Approach of "Huge Conversations"

The creators of the show believe that by envisioning positive futures, they become more likely to materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The spin-off series, "Huge Conversations," features longer, more in-depth discussions with individuals who are actively shaping the future through their innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

A primary goal for "Huge Conversations" is to investigate the potential success of these technologies, rather than focusing on past or future failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The show aims to explore how these advancements might improve things, solve significant problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, and grapple with both the promise and potential dangers if they come to fruition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This exploration is conducted through an optimistic lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, allowing viewers to clearly see the envisioned future and decide if they wish to contribute to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

Formula E, the fully electric car racing series, was conceived as a "space program for electric cars" with the goal of rapidly advancing electric vehicle technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. This initiative aims to push forward the technology as fast as possible, creating the future not only of car racing but also of everyday cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

## Origins and Technological Mandate

The idea for Formula E emerged from a dinner in Paris 11 years ago, attended by figures like Alejandro Agag, Antonio Tajani (former European Commissioner for Transport), and Jean Todt (President of the FIA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. They recognized an impending moment of change where electrification would be pushed by bodies like the European Commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

Unlike [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] (F1), which at the time could not simply swap to electric cars due to battery limitations for their race distances (305 km/190 miles in under two hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a> and resistance from car manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>, Formula E was created as a brand new championship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. It received an exclusive 25-year license to be the only fully electric racing championship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. This means [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] cannot become fully electric without conflicting with this license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Formula E Cars (Gen 1 to Gen 3)

The [[origins_and_development_of_formula_e | origins and development of Formula E]] directly track the progress in electric vehicle technology.

### Gen 1 (First Formula E Car)
The Gen 1 car, launched in 2014, was the first of its kind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. Its primary challenge was battery range, as electric cars in 2014 could only achieve about 250 miles per charge at absolute max, and much less during high-speed racing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. To overcome this, drivers would use two cars per race, swapping from one car to another during a pit stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.

### Gen 2
After four years, the Gen 2 car was introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>. The major improvement was its ability to cover twice the distance, allowing drivers to complete an entire race with a single car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.

### Gen 3
The Gen 3 car is the fastest and most powerful electric race car ever built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. It represents the biggest step up in technology for Formula E <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>. Key improvements include:
*   **Increased Power**: From 250 kilowatts to 350 kilowatts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.
*   **Reduced Weight**: Decreased from just over 900 kilograms to approximately 850 kilograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>. This combination of more power and lighter weight leads to faster speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>.

## Focus on Powertrain Technology
Unlike [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]], where costs are a significant factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>, all Formula E teams are required to use the same chassis, battery, and most ancillary parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>. This deliberate design choice focuses teams' investment on innovating powertrain components responsible for converting battery energy into speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>. These components include the rear motor, inverter, gearbox, and associated software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:10:00]</a>.

### Regenerative Braking System
A significant innovation in the Gen 3 car is its unique braking system. It notably lacks rear mechanical brakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>. Instead, the cars stop using their electric motors, which convert kinetic energy into electrical energy that is then used to recharge the batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>. This regenerative braking allows for the recuperation of up to 80% of the energy back into the battery during braking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>. The Gen 3 is the first car in history not to feature mechanical rear brakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>. While this technology is still being pushed forward and has led to some "scare moments" during testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>, it represents a substantial step forward for both electric race cars and future consumer electric vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>.

## [[impact_of_electric_racing_on_consumer_vehicle_technology | Impact on Consumer Vehicle Technology]]
Formula E acts as a "group science project," experimenting with new technologies that can directly translate to road vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>. Innovations like the advanced regenerative braking system are expected to appear in future electric cars, leading to increased range, faster charging, and cleaner driving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>. The sport's core purpose is to advertise the future of cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>, ensuring that racing technology aligns with the evolving automotive industry, especially as governments move towards banning new gas car sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.

Supersonic commercial flight, once a reality with the Concorde, aims for a return with [[technological_advancements_in_supersonic_travel | advancements]] focused on overcoming past limitations, primarily the sonic boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. [[technological_advancements_and_future_potential | NASA]] is at the forefront of this effort, working to make commercial supersonic travel viable again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## The Concorde: A Supersonic Pioneer

Twenty years ago, it was possible to fly in a plane faster than sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The Concorde, a supersonic plane, could complete the New York to London journey in just 3.5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. It flew at such high altitudes that passengers could see the curve of the Earth while enjoying champagne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

The Concorde's design, originating in the 1960s, appeared futuristic even decades later, resembling a child's paper dart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Its features included:
*   A long, narrow body to reduce air resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   Wide, delta-shaped wings for lift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   A "droop snoot" nose that lowered during takeoff and landing to provide pilots visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   Powerful engines designed for rapid incoming air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   Special paint to discharge heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Speed Comparison
For context, supersonic speed is defined as anything over Mach 1, or approximately 767 mph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **World's fastest train**: Around 286 mph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Fastest car**: Around 330 mph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Average Boeing 737**: Around 520 mph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Concorde**: 1,350 mph (Mach 2.04), comparable to a military F-16 fighter jet's top speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### [[history_and_demise_of_the_concorde_supersonic_plane | History and Demise of the Concorde Supersonic Plane]]
Despite its allure, the Concorde ceased operations, and no similar planes were made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Today, the New York to London flight takes 7 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

Key factors leading to the Concorde's retirement include:
*   **Sonic Boom Regulations**: In 1973, the FAA banned commercial supersonic flights over the United States due to the loud sonic booms, with similar rules enacted globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This severely restricted routes, largely limiting flights to over-ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Operating Costs**: The engines were fuel-guzzling, and rising fuel costs added to expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Safety Concerns**: A deadly crash in 2000 damaged public perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Retirement**: Air France stopped flying the Concorde, and British Airways, the sole remaining operator, followed suit in early 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. The Concorde was ahead of its time but could not overcome the sonic boom problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## The Sonic Boom Problem

A sonic boom occurs when a plane flies faster than the speed of sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. As a plane moves, it pushes air out of its path, creating pressure waves at its front and back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. When the plane exceeds sound speed, air molecules cannot move out of the way fast enough, compressing together to form shockwaves off the front and back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. When these waves reach our ears, they are perceived as a loud "double bang" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

A common misconception is that a sonic boom happens only once when the plane breaks the sound barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. In reality, it booms continuously along the plane's flight path, "carpeting" the ground below with sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Inside the plane, however, passengers do not hear the boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

The Concorde's sonic boom was loud, comparable to a balloon popping from the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## [[nasas_x59_supersonic_plane_and_its_innovations | NASA's X-59 Supersonic Plane and its Innovations]]

The [[nasas_x59_supersonic_plane_and_its_innovations | X-59]] is [[nasas_x59_supersonic_plane_and_its_innovations | NASA]]'s experimental single-seater jet, designed to travel at 925 mph (Mach 1.4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Its primary goal is to prove that supersonic planes can be quiet enough to not disrupt everyday life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. This effort is being conducted with Lockheed Martin at Skunkworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### [[challenges_and_solutions_for_reducing_sonic_booms | Challenges and Solutions for Reducing Sonic Booms]]
The [[nasas_x59_supersonic_plane_and_its_innovations | X-59]] incorporates design features inspired by the Concorde, such as large delta wings and a streamlined body, but with significant modifications to reduce the sonic boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

Key innovations for quiet supersonic flight:
*   **Extended Nose**: The [[nasas_x59_supersonic_plane_and_its_innovations | X-59]] features a rigid, 38-foot carbon fiber nose, significantly longer than the Concorde's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This nose is crucial for minimizing the initial "splash" or sound of the sonic boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. As it doesn't move, a camera at the front sends a live video feed to the pilot for takeoff and landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Smooth Underside**: The bottom of the aircraft is exceptionally smooth and clean to direct any small shockwaves upwards, away from people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **T-tail**: This feature on the back of the plane creates its own shockwave that interacts with and cancels out some of the main boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **Anti-Static Paint**: A special anti-static paint prevents the buildup of static electricity as the plane moves through the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

[[nasas_x59_supersonic_plane_and_its_innovations | NASA]]'s goal is to change the regulation banning supersonic flight over land, allowing it if the sound level is below a certain threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. They are targeting 75 perceived level DB, which would sound like a neighbor closing a car door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. The [[nasas_x59_supersonic_plane_and_its_innovations | X-59]] is a one-off demonstration aircraft, not a passenger plane, designed solely to prove the feasibility of low-boom supersonic flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

## Commercial Resurgence and [[future_potential_of_electric_planes | Future Potential]]

If [[nasas_x59_supersonic_plane_and_its_innovations | NASA]] succeeds in demonstrating quiet supersonic flight and helps change regulations, it could open the door for more companies to develop and operate supersonic planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. Several private companies, including "Boom," are working to bring back these aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

The timeline for the return of passenger supersonic flight is still a decade away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. This includes testing the [[nasas_x59_supersonic_plane_and_its_innovations | X-59]], conducting community tests, and going through the regulation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. Despite the wait, three airlines have already placed orders for future supersonic planes, indicating confidence in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

The [[future_potential_of_electric_planes | future of supersonic flight]] extends beyond just addressing the sonic boom:
*   **Sustainability**: New planes must be more sustainable and not guzzle fuel like the Concorde <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
*   **Cost**: Flights need to be more affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   **Capacity**: Future supersonic planes will need to carry more than just a single passenger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

Experts remain optimistic, believing that another supersonic airliner will offer commercial travel to the general public in the not-too-distant [[technological_advancements_and_future_potential | future]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. The ability to go farther faster can lead to greater global connection and exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

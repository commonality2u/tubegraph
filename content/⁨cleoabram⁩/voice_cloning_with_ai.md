[[ai_in_music_creation | AI voice cloning]] is a technology that allows for the creation of new songs using the simulated voices of artists, even if those artists never performed the specific song <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This technology is described as "just the beginning" of what is happening in [[ai_in_music_creation | AI music]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Examples of AI Voice Cloning
Initial examples of [[ai_in_music_creation | AI music]] include:
*   Frank Sinatra singing "Get Low" by Lil Jon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   Linkin Park singing the "Pokemon Song" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   Johnny Cash singing "Barbie Girl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

These examples were created using AI voice clones, meaning the original artists never actually performed these songs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Voice Cloning as a Creative Tool
[[ai_in_music_creation | AI music]] allows people to create entirely new songs through "fake collaborations" or to generate lyrics and melodies rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The rapid advancement of this technology has led to discussions about its potential impact on music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. While some believe [[ai_in_music_creation | AI]] could be "the death of music," it's also seen as an opportunity for humans to "LEAP ahead" in self-expression, provided the challenges are addressed correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

One perspective is that [[ai_in_music_creation | AI]] can help "shrink the gap" between an artist's ideal musical idea and what they can realistically create with their existing tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. This is because creativity is distinct from technical skill, and lowering the technical skill required can lead to more great music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. Just as computers became a tool for musical geniuses like Avicii, [[ai_in_music_creation | AI]] is viewed as a new, powerful tool for artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

## Grimes's Approach to Voice Cloning
Artist Grimes is a proponent of voice cloning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. She released a tool called Elf Tech, which enables users to change their own voice into hers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. On Spotify, there are two verified Grimes artist profiles: "human Grimes" and a "collaborator for anyone else who uses her voice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. Grimes intends to feature the best collaborations created with her voice and plans to release a "competitive [[ai_in_music_creation | AI]] album" alongside her own album to see which performs better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.

Under Grimes's model, individuals creating new songs and recordings using her voice and likeness are required to pay her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>. This approach fits within existing music industry payment structures for sampling, interpolation, and covers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.

## Concerns and [[copyright_issues_with_aigenerated_music | Copyright Issues]]
While some embrace voice cloning, many artists are "extremely not okay" with others using their voice in this manner, emphasizing the importance of consent and [[copyright_issues_with_aigenerated_music | copyright]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. A major question is when artists should be paid in a world of [[ai_in_music_creation | AI music]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. The [[impact_of_ai_on_the_music_industry | music industry]]'s current rules distinguish between inspiration and copying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

The challenge arises with music created "in the style of" an artist or sounds like a collaboration without using their specific composition or original recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. Daniel Ek, CEO of Spotify, stated that Spotify would not know what tools an artist uses to create their music, as they receive audio files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. He emphasizes that the "output" of [[ai_in_music_creation | AI]] training is more important than the input, focusing on whether the result is new intellectual property (IP) rather than something "drafting off someone else's name and likeness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. He draws the line when the output is "confusingly similar" to an existing artist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>.

The discussion also extends to situations where [[ai_in_music_creation | AI]] becomes more autonomous, potentially generating millions or billions of songs. This raises fundamental questions about IP ownership and whether an [[ai_in_music_creation | AI]] can be considered a "creator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>.

Despite the [[challenges_and_concerns_of_ai_replacing_artists | challenges and concerns]], some believe that [[ai_in_music_creation | AI]] can empower more people to realize their musical talent and express themselves, thereby increasing human expression through music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>.

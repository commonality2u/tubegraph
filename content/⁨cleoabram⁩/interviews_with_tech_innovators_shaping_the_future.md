"Huge Conversations" is an interview series stemming from the "Huge If True" show, dedicated to in-depth discussions with leading figures in technology who are actively shaping the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The original show, "Huge If True," has spent two years exploring various [[emerging_technologies_impacting_the_future | new technologies]] with the potential to change the world, including humanoid robots, quantum computers, supersonic planes, and particle colliders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Background and Purpose

The underlying belief behind these initiatives is that by [[importance_of_optimistic_visions_for_future_innovation | envisioning better futures]], they become more likely to materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. "Huge Conversations" was created to share longer-form, more comprehensive discussions with the key individuals [[challenges and successes in technological progress | building these tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. These individuals possess visions that could soon impact billions of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The series aims to provide unedited access to these conversations, complementing the existing explainer videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## The Philosophy of "Huge Conversations"

The approach of "Huge Conversations" differs significantly from much of the media covering technology. Instead of focusing on past failures or potential future setbacks, the series asks the inverse question: "What if they succeed?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This perspective acknowledges that success can [[exploring_potential_future_solutions_to_global_challenges | change things for the better]] and solve significant problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. It also recognizes that some of humanity's [[challenges_and_successes_in_technological_progress | biggest challenges]] today are a [[challenges_and_successes_in_technological_progress | product of our progress]] and past successes, rather than failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Envisioning the Future

The interviews encourage those at the cutting edge to [[exploring_potential_future_solutions_to_global_challenges | paint a picture of the future]] they are actively working to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This includes grappling with both the promise and the perils of these visions coming to fruition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The series asserts that an [[importance_of_optimistic_visions_for_future_innovation | optimistic lens]] is essential for this deep engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. While not always agreeing with the futures presented, the goal is to clearly engage with the innovators' imaginations so that viewers can understand and decide whether they wish to contribute to that future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The show aims to help audiences understand what the most important people [[emerging_technologies_impacting_the_future | shaping the future]] are imagining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

The lifespan of dogs is often a painful reality for owners, as dogs typically live significantly shorter lives than humans, leading to the common experience of watching them pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. However, there are ongoing [[efforts to extend dogs lifespans | efforts to extend dogs' lifespans]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Dispelling the "Dog Years" Myth

For a long time, it was commonly believed that to calculate a dog's age in human years, one simply multiplied the dog's age by seven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This would suggest that a 2-year-old dog is 14 (a teenager) and a 10-year-old dog is 70 (a distinguished gentleman) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. However, veterinarians refer to this as "the myth that never dies," as it is not based on any [[scientific_research_on_dog_aging | scientific research]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. It was likely derived from the approximate human lifespan of 70 years and dog lifespan of 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

A more scientific method to compare a dog's age to a human's has emerged from [[scientific_research_on_dog_aging | research]] by geneticists at UC San Diego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This research indicates a non-linear relationship: a 1-year-old dog is roughly equivalent to a 30-year-old person, while a 14-year-old dog is only about 70 in human years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This suggests that dogs, as a species, age faster when young and slower when old, compared to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Quantifying Aging: The Methylation Clock

Measuring aging often involves looking at cellular damage and changes to DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. One method for quantifying aging is the "aging clock" known as "methylation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This involves modifications to DNA that change predictably with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. The UC San Diego [[scientific_research_on_dog_aging | researchers]] used DNA collected from Labradors over 16 years, comparing it to human DNA ranging from ages 1 to 103, to develop their aging chart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This method helps understand the underlying biological changes associated with aging, such as frailty, cancer, and other diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## Significant Variances in Lifespan Among Breeds

While the methylation clock was developed using Labrador data, it highlights a crucial point: [[dog_aging_and_lifespan | dog breeds]] exhibit surprisingly different lifespans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. For instance, a Great Dane might only live 6-8 years, whereas a Chihuahua can live 18 years or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Generally, larger dog breeds tend to have shorter lifespans than smaller ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### The Impact of Selective Breeding

This significant variance in lifespan is largely attributed to human [[genetics_and_selective_breeding_in_dogs | selective breeding]] practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Humans have accidentally bred dogs for genetics that cause "growth issues," leading to these dramatic differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Metabolic Rate and Aging

Small dogs seem to hold the secret to longer canine lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. While dogs are born at very similar sizes, bigger dogs grow metabolically at a much faster rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. It is thought that the biological mechanisms that drive their rapid growth in puppyhood do not fully deactivate or function correctly after they reach full size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This causes larger breeds to age at an accelerated rate and consequently die sooner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

## Research Efforts to Extend Dog Lifespans

Companies like Loyal are focused on understanding these differences between dog breeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Their goal is to develop drugs that can make the metabolism of a big dog more closely resemble that of a small dog, potentially extending their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. While there isn't a pill currently available to extend a dog's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, this [[scientific_research_on_dog_aging | research]] aims to bring forward drugs that help dogs live longer, healthier lives, with the hope that insights gained could also eventually benefit humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

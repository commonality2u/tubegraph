The "closed" nuclear fuel cycle is a proposed method of nuclear energy production that involves reusing spent nuclear fuel, significantly reducing the amount and radioactivity of nuclear waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. This approach contrasts with the current "once-through" fuel cycle predominantly used in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

## The Problem with "Once-Through" Fuel Cycle

Currently, the United States employs a "once-through" fuel cycle for nuclear power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. In this cycle, uranium is mined, used once in a reactor, and then the spent fuel is considered high-level nuclear waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. This waste is a mix of leftover Uranium-235, Uranium-238, and unstable atoms that emit ionizing radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. This radioactive material remains dangerous for hundreds of thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

Most US nuclear waste is stored in dry casks, designed to last decades, not the hundreds of thousands of years required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. This creates an ongoing challenge of long-term storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Critics in the 1960s likened the "once-through" approach to "using the cream and throwing away the milk," highlighting the inefficiency of discarding useful materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

## [[nuclear_waste_as_energy | Using Nuclear Waste as an Energy Source]]

A reactor built by Argonne National Laboratory in 1962 demonstrated the ability to produce electricity from nuclear waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This technology suggests that nuclear waste is not merely radioactive trash but an "incredible clean energy resource" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Experts agree that the existing nuclear waste in the US could serve as a substantial energy source, potentially powering the country for the next 150 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, based on already built technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### The [[nuclear_waste_recycling | Nuclear Waste Recycling]] Process

Argonne National Laboratory continues to test [[nuclear_waste_recycling | nuclear waste recycling]] in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. The process involves:
1.  **Cutting:** Spent nuclear waste is cut into small pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
2.  **Dissolving:** These pieces are dissolved in a vat of molten salts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
3.  **Separation:** Electricity is run through the vat, separating uranium and other useful materials from the rest of the waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
4.  **New Fuel Rods:** The separated useful materials form deposits from which new fuel rods are created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
5.  **Reuse:** These new fuel rods are then placed back into a reactor for further energy generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

This recycling can be done multiple times, not only generating more electricity but also significantly reducing the time the waste remains radioactive—from hundreds of thousands of years down to hundreds of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

### Benefits of a Closed Fuel Cycle

A closed fuel cycle offers several advantages:
*   **Reduced Radioactivity Duration:** Dramatically cuts the time nuclear waste needs to be stored, making long-term management much more feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Resource Conservation:** Maximizes the use of uranium, which is a finite resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Reduced Dependence on Imports:** For countries like Japan, a closed cycle reduces reliance on imported fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Clean Energy Source:** Transforms what is currently considered hazardous waste into a valuable [[transitioning_from_fossil_fuels_to_clean_energy | clean energy]] resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Historical Context and Challenges in the US

Despite early advancements, the US halted nuclear recycling in 1977 under President Jimmy Carter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. This policy aimed to mitigate the risk of nuclear war by preventing the separation of plutonium, an element of high concern for nuclear proliferation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. The US then shifted from "fast reactors," capable of handling nuclear waste, to "light water reactors," which are the current standard and cannot recycle fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

While President Reagan lifted the ban in 1981, the nuclear industry had already invested heavily in "light water reactors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Today, the primary argument against [[nuclear_waste_recycling | nuclear fuel recycling]] in the US is its high cost compared to the cheap and plentiful supply of new uranium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

## The Future of the Closed Fuel Cycle

Some countries, such as Japan, are already implementing closed fuel cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. In the US, companies like Oklo are working with Argonne National Laboratory to bring back this technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

There is a growing recognition of the need for more [[transitioning_from_fossil_fuels_to_clean_energy | clean energy]] solutions, and global conflicts are raising concerns about fuel supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. The technology for a closed fuel cycle has been demonstrated and proven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>; the main challenge now is its commercialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Implementing a closed nuclear fuel cycle could be a profound step towards a sustainable energy future, overcoming past fears and effectively utilizing existing resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), located on the border between France and Switzerland, is the largest science experiment ever constructed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This massive underground particle accelerator is a 27 km long tunnel, over 100 meters underground, running beneath homes, businesses, and farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Inside, a long blue tube contains two pipes kept colder and emptier than outer space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Through these pipes, particles smaller than atoms are fired in opposite directions, pushed faster and faster until they are almost at the speed of light, at which point they smash together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This process sends subatomic debris flying into a massive detector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

Building this underground particle smasher took thousands of people from over a hundred different countries, cost $5 billion, and required over 30 years to plan and construct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The primary goal is to understand the fundamental fabric of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

## CERN and the LHC's Purpose

The LHC is situated within CERN, the biggest and most famous physics lab globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Thousands of scientists from around the world gather here to conduct cutting-edge research into how the universe operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

The ATLAS detector is one of the specific locations where particles collide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The detector itself is enormous, but the actual collision point is tiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The beam pipe, which contains the particles, is about the diameter of an orange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Thousands of magnets along this pipe force the particles into a space the width of a human hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### The Scale of the Universe

Particles are incredibly small, far tinier than most people realize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   If a single strand of hair were as wide as the entire Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   A single cell within that hair would be equivalent to the distance from Paris to Rome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   A protein in that cell would be six soccer fields across <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   An atom inside that protein would be one school bus across <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   The nucleus at the atom's center would be the width of a grain of rice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   Protons within that nucleus would be like grains of salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
    *   A proton compared to the width of a human hair is akin to a grain of salt compared to the entire Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

These protons, squeezed into a space the width of a hair, are what scientists send flying through the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### Particle Collisions

To ensure these tiny protons actually hit each other, scientists don't just fire a few <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. They fire 100 billion protons in bunches in each direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Even then, on average, only about 50 or 60 collisions occur per crossing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. To compensate, the process is repeated approximately 30 million times per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, involving around 3,000 bunches, each with over 100 billion protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Unveiling the Universe's Secrets

The purpose of smashing protons together is not to create black holes or new dimensions, despite popular theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Instead, these collisions offer a glimpse into what might have occurred near the beginning of our universe, during the Big Bang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

Proton collisions release an enormous amount of energy, which, as determined by a very smart person, can turn into physical mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. If the energy is high enough, it can transform into mysterious or unknown particles—more of the universe's building blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. These special "mystery particles" exist only for an instant before decaying into everyday particles that fly outward to hit sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Scientists then work backward, using complex physics, to "reverse engineer" what happened during the collision and identify potential mystery particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### [[particle_physics_and_the_standard_model | The Standard Model]] and Elementary Particles

[[particle_physics_and_the_standard_model | Particle physics]] aims to understand the fundamental fabric of the universe by breaking down matter into its smallest, indivisible components: elementary particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Many elementary particles, such as electrons and photons, are already known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This knowledge is derived from complex mathematics and decades of experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This mathematical framework, which describes how the world around us works, is called [[particle_physics_and_the_standard_model | The Standard Model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### The Search for the [[the_discovery_and_significance_of_the_higgs_boson | Higgs Boson]]

[[particle_physics_and_the_standard_model | The Standard Model]] predicted the existence of a mystery particle, the [[the_discovery_and_significance_of_the_higgs_boson | Higgs Boson]], which was likely present at the universe's beginning but had never been detected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Also known as the "God Particle," its detection was of vital importance because it would confirm an underlying field responsible for giving other particles mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. This discovery would help explain "why stuff exists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

To create the [[the_discovery_and_significance_of_the_higgs_boson | Higgs Boson]], sufficient energy was needed in one place, which could be achieved by smashing two protons together at nearly the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. This was a significant reason for building the Large Hadron Collider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

After its construction, thousands of scientists spent two years collecting data, finally announcing that they had reliably created the [[the_discovery_and_significance_of_the_higgs_boson | Higgs Boson]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. This confirmation was visualized as a "bump on a chart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, indicating more particles being produced at a specific energy level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This confirmed the mathematical predictions of [[particle_physics_and_the_standard_model | the Standard Model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

While the [[the_discovery_and_significance_of_the_higgs_boson | Higgs Boson]]'s confirmation didn't immediately alter daily life, it validated humanity's approach to understanding the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Discovering fundamental building blocks today enables future generations to develop unimagined technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

## The Future of Particle Accelerators

The Large Hadron Collider has profoundly shaped our understanding of elementary particle interactions and rigorously tested theories about the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. However, some scientists believe that the LHC might have reached its limit for new discoveries, and there remains much unknown about the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

### The [[future_circular_collider_and_its_potential_impact | Future Circular Collider]] (FCC)

A significant debate currently revolves around building a much larger collider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This proposed new collider, named the [[future_circular_collider_and_its_potential_impact | Future Circular Collider]] (FCC), would be a 100 km loop, significantly larger than the LHC's 27 km <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. CERN estimates its cost at approximately $17 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

One major mystery scientists hope to explore with a new collider is dark matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Dark matter accounts for 27% of our universe, its presence inferred by its gravitational effects on visible matter and light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. While there's no guarantee a new collider would find dark matter, it could answer other questions or reveal completely unexpected phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

Not everyone agrees on the necessity of the FCC. Some argue that the LHC hasn't fully met its expectations, and predictions suggest even more energy than the FCC would provide might be needed to produce truly novel findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Despite these arguments, proponents emphasize the importance of pursuing fundamental research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

### [[advancements_and_applications_from_cern_research | Byproducts of Pure Research]]

The [[advancements_and_applications_from_cern_research | pure science conducted at CERN]] has already yielded significant byproducts with real-world applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. These include:
*   New cancer treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>
*   Improved medical imaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>
*   More efficient electric cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>
*   More sensitive radiation detectors used in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>
*   The World Wide Web, which originated as a new way for scientists to communicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>

### The Value of Fundamental Research

Investing in pure research is essential for future applied research and technological advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. Fundamental research lays the very basic groundwork, akin to kindergarten in an educational system, upon which all further understanding and innovation are built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

While humans experience only a tiny sliver of reality, there is immense value in striving to learn more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. The effort put into fundamental scientific endeavors today can lead to a world beyond current imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. These "enormous monuments dedicated to knowledge" reflect humanity's innate desire to learn, improve, and understand its place in the vast, barely comprehensible universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

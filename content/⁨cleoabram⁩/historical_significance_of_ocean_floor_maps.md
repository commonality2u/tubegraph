Despite the vastness of the ocean, the maps available of its floor have historically been "terrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Current knowledge of the ocean floor is significantly less detailed than that of Mars' surface, with Mars mapped to 5 meters per pixel and most oceans only to 1.5 kilometers per pixel, representing 300 times less detail than Earth's landmasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This lack of detailed mapping presents a major challenge, despite the ocean's constant use for activities like laying [[underwater_internet_cables | internet cables]], trade, and sourcing food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Early Attempts at Mapping the Deep
Mapping the ocean is "shockingly hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a> primarily due to its immense depth, cold temperatures, and the rapid increase in pressure with depth, which prevents light from penetrating beyond approximately a thousand meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Cartographically speaking, "water sucks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a> because light, essential for taking pictures of land surfaces, cannot reach the ocean floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

Before direct measurement technologies were widespread, much of the perceived topography on platforms like Google Maps was derived from satellite gravity data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Marine scientist Steve Hall explains that the ocean's surface is not perfectly flat; it subtly mirrors the shape of the seafloor below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Due to the Earth's non-constant gravitational field, a deep trench causes a slight dip in the sea surface above it, while a mountain creates a tiny bulge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Satellites send radar pulses to measure these surface height variations, allowing for an estimation of the ocean floor's shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. However, this technique provides only a "pretty good approximation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, relying heavily on "educated guesswork" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a> and lacking precise detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

## Marie Tharp and the Dawn of Sonar Mapping
The invention of sonar, which uses acoustic waves to measure the time it takes for pulses to bounce back from the seabed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>, marked a significant advancement. However, it wasn't until the 1940s that cartographer Marie Tharp transformed these raw sonar measurements into comprehensive maps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

Tharp's methodology was meticulous:
1.  **Raw Data Interpretation**: Initial sonar data provided "super raw" lines with numbers indicating depths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
2.  **Contour Sketching**: Using colored pencils, Tharp would manually connect these lines to deduce the contours of the ocean bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
3.  **Profile Creation**: She then connected the dots to create 2D "profiles" or slices of land, which began to resemble underwater mountains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
4.  **Hand-Sketching**: Along with her research partner Bruce Heezen, Tharp sketched by hand what parts of the ocean might look like, combining these profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

These maps revealed previously unseen features like mountains and valleys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, establishing them as some of the first, if not *the* first, true ocean floor maps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. The first published map of the ocean floor, from 1957 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>, and a later 1977 version are considered works of art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

## Modern Advancements and Future Endeavors
Despite their beauty and groundbreaking nature, Marie Tharp's maps had "big parts that they had to essentially make up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a> because they relied on narrow lines of sonar data from old shipping routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

Today, [[technological_advancements_in_ocean_mapping | sonar technology]] has vastly improved. Modern sonar devices send thousands of beams in a wide fan, spanning several kilometers, allowing for mapping much larger areas with significantly greater detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

The continued [[importance_of_detailed_ocean_mapping | importance of detailed ocean mapping]] is highlighted by the need to navigate the deep ocean for purposes such as laying [[underwater_internet_cables | internet cables]], predicting tsunamis, understanding sea level rise, developing renewable energy, and aiding in disaster response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. For example, the search for flight MH370 revealed uncharted mountain ranges and valleys on the seafloor where a Boeing 777 could easily be hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

The [[seabed_2030_initiative | Seabed 2030 initiative]] aims to map the entire ocean floor in detail by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>, targeting resolutions of 800 meters for unknown areas and a few meters for high-traffic zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. This initiative leverages data from various sources, including oil and gas companies, environmental groups, and militaries (with caveats for sensitive areas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. It also relies on cutting-edge [[technological_advancements in ocean mapping | ocean technology]], such as autonomous underwater robots that "mow the lawn" by systematically taking measurements, a task too tedious for humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Artificial intelligence (AI) is also being developed to enable robots to identify and investigate interesting features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

Since the project began, the detailed mapping coverage of the ocean floor has increased from 6% to 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. While concerns exist about the potential misuse of detailed maps, Steve Hall argues that the "lack of map is not the barrier to any of those people going out there and doing mining" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>, emphasizing that "you can't manage what you haven't measured" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. Mapping our environment is crucial for understanding it and using it for the better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Exploring the ocean, the last unknown place on Earth, is comparable to international collaborations in space, representing a collective human endeavor to understand a different world through [[technological_advancements in ocean mapping | technology]], curiosity, and grit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

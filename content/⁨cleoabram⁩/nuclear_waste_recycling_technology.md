Nuclear waste recycling involves processing spent nuclear fuel to extract usable materials, significantly reducing the volume and radioactivity of the remaining waste while also creating new fuel for electricity generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This technology, demonstrated as early as 1962, offers a path to an incredible clean energy future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## A Legacy of Innovation

In 1962, [[Argonne National Laboratory | Argonne National Laboratory]] developed a nuclear reactor capable of generating electricity from nuclear waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This was seen as a transformative step, with predictions that by the year 2000, more than half of the country's electric power would come from atomic sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. However, this vision for [[the potential of reusing nuclear waste for energy | reusing nuclear waste for energy]] was not realized, and today, the United States does not reuse any of its nuclear waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## The Nuclear Waste Problem

Nuclear waste is the radioactive material left over after nuclear fuel is used up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. It's often visualized as glowing green goo in yellow barrels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. After four to six years of operation, spent uranium fuel is considered high-level nuclear waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This waste is a mix of Uranium-238, leftover Uranium-235, and unstable atoms that emit ionizing radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Ionizing radiation can be harmful in large doses, affecting tissues and DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

A major [[Challenges and opportunities in nuclear energy | challenge]] is that nuclear waste remains radioactive for an incredibly long time, sometimes hundreds of thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Currently, most nuclear waste in the U.S. is stored in dry casks designed to last decades, not the hundreds of thousands of years required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. This creates an ongoing debate about long-term storage solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. The current practice in the U.S. is a "once-through" fuel cycle: uranium is mined, used once, and then stored indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

## The Recycling Solution

If nuclear waste can be recycled, it transforms from dangerous trash into an incredible clean energy resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. [[Argonne National Laboratory | Argonne National Laboratory]] remains one of the few places in the U.S. still testing nuclear waste recycling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

The recycling process involves:
1.  Cutting nuclear waste into small pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
2.  Dissolving these pieces in molten salts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
3.  Running electricity through the vat to separate uranium and other useful materials from the rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
4.  Collecting these useful materials as deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
5.  Making new fuel rods from these deposits and returning them to a reactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

This process can be repeated multiple times, not only generating more electricity but also dramatically reducing the time the waste remains radioactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. By using up the longest-lasting radioactive materials, the storage time frame can be cut from hundreds of thousands of years down to hundreds of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

This "closed" fuel cycle involves mining uranium, using it in a reactor, filtering out useful components, reusing it multiple times, and then storing the significantly reduced remaining waste for a much shorter period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Some countries, like Japan, already implement [[global_perspectives_on_nuclear_fuel_recycling | nuclear fuel recycling]] to reduce dependence on imported fuel, conserve uranium, and minimize waste radioactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

## Why the U.S. Diverged

In 1977, President Jimmy Carter implemented new policies that halted all nuclear recycling in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. The primary reason was to prevent nuclear proliferation, as plutonium, a highly radioactive element used in weapons, is separated during the recycling process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. The U.S. shifted from "fast reactors," which could handle nuclear waste, to "light water reactors," which are common today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

Although President Reagan lifted the ban in 1981, companies had already invested in reactors that could not recycle fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Today, the main argument against nuclear fuel recycling is that it is too costly and not economical compared to cheap and plentiful new uranium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

## A Resurging Interest

Despite past challenges and economic hurdles, there is a renewed interest in nuclear waste recycling. The potential for global conflicts to disrupt fuel supplies and the pressing need for more clean energy are driving factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. The technology for recycling nuclear waste has been demonstrated and proven; the challenge now lies in commercializing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. This represents an opportunity to change perceptions about nuclear energy and utilize existing resources more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

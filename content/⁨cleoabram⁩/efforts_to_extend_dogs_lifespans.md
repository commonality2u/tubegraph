It is a common experience for dog owners to recognize that dogs live significantly shorter lives than humans, often leading to the difficult reality of outliving their beloved pets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. However, [[scientific_research_on_dog_aging | scientific research on dog aging]] is underway to understand and potentially extend [[dog_aging_and_lifespan | dog aging and lifespan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Debunking the "Dog Years" Myth

The widely circulated belief that "one human year equals seven dog years" is a myth not based on any scientific [[scientific_research_on_dog_aging | scientific research on dog aging]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. It likely arose from a rough comparison of average human and dog lifespans (humans living to around 70, dogs to 10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

A more accurate, [[scientific_research_on_dog_aging | scientific research on dog aging]]-based comparison of dog and human age comes from geneticists at UC San Diego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This research indicates a non-linear relationship:
*   A 1-year-old dog is equivalent to a 30-year-old person (not 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   A 14-year-old dog is equivalent to a 70-year-old person (not 98) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
This suggests that dogs as a species age faster when young and slower when old, relative to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Quantifying Aging

Understanding and slowing aging requires a way to quantify it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The company Loyal aims to develop a comprehensive quantified aging process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Cellular Damage**: Current theories suggest that aging is caused by the accumulation of various types of cellular damage, which eventually leads to age-related diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **DNA Methylation**: One method of measuring aging is by observing changes to DNA, specifically through "methylation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This "aging clock" reflects modifications to DNA that predictively change with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. The UC San Diego research used DNA from Labradors collected over 16 years, compared to human DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Differences in Lifespan Between Dog Breeds

There are significant [[differences_in_lifespan_between_dog_breeds | differences in lifespan between dog breeds]], with a twofold variance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. For example, a Great Dane might live 6-8 years, while a Chihuahua can live 18 years or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Generally, big dogs live shorter lives than small dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

This strong correlation is attributed to human [[genetics_and_selective_breeding_in_dogs | genetics and selective breeding in dogs]]:
*   Humans accidentally selectively bred for [[genetics_and_selective_breeding_in_dogs | genetic]] traits that cause growth issues in larger breeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   While dogs are born similar in size, larger breeds grow metabolically much faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   It's theorized that the biological processes driving rapid growth in large puppies don't fully "turn off" or function correctly once the dog is grown, leading to a faster aging rate and shorter average lifespans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

Loyal is specifically focusing its [[scientific_research_on_dog_aging | scientific research on dog aging]] on understanding these [[differences_in_lifespan_between_dog_breeds | differences in lifespan between dog breeds]] to develop treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Their goal is to make the metabolism of a big dog more closely resemble that of a small dog, potentially extending their lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Currently, there is no commercially available pill to help dogs live longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Loyal is in the research phase, identifying specific targets and drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. The ultimate mission of Loyal is to develop drugs that help dogs live longer, healthier lives, with the added benefit of learning more about aging that could potentially help humans as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

> "My mission in Loyal and in life in general is to bring forward drugs that help dogs live longer, healthier lives. And while doing that also learn more about aging and use that to hopefully one day help people too.” <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>

While a direct anti-aging solution is not yet available, there are actions owners can take to help their dogs live the longest possible lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

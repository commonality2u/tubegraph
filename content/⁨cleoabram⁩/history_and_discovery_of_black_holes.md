[[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | Black holes]] are among the most astonishing places in our universe, characterized by immense gravity so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. They can be incredibly vast, with some capable of encompassing over 60 of our solar systems and possessing masses up to 100 billion times that of our Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Theoretical Origins

Initially, [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black holes]] were considered a "mathematical quirk" or a "weird solution to equations" that otherwise aligned with our understanding of the universe, existing only as theoretical constructs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. The fundamental idea behind a [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black hole]] is the extreme collapse of a massive star <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. For instance, if a star with the mass of our Sun were artificially squashed down to a radius of just 3 kilometers, the gravity at its surface would become so immense that the escape velocity would exceed the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This means even light rays emitted from its surface would be trapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This concept aligns with [[einsteins_theory_of_relativity_and_black_holes | Einstein's theory of relativity]], which posits that spacetime is stretchy and warps in response to matter and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. A [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black hole]] represents the most extreme known example of this spacetime distortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

## From Theory to Reality

The theoretical nature of [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black holes]] shifted as scientists began to find observational evidence for their existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Over several decades, researchers measured the movements of stars, galaxies, and gases that appeared warped by seemingly empty regions of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. These "empty patches" were later understood to be the remnants of stars much larger than our Sun that had undergone a collapsing death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. These observations confirmed that [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black holes]] are real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### Ubiquity in the Universe

We now understand that [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black holes]] are ubiquitous throughout the universe, with some estimates suggesting there could be as many as 40 quintillion of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Furthermore, almost every galaxy, including our own Milky Way, hosts a supermassive [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black hole]] at its center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Detection through Accretion Discs

One key method for detecting [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black holes]] is by observing their glowing [[inner_workings_of_black_holes | accretion discs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. An [[inner_workings_of_black_holes | accretion disc]] consists of material spiraling violently in orbit around the dense [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black hole]], heating up and emitting light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. While the [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black hole]] itself traps light, the emitted light from the disc is visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The immense gravity of a [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black hole]] also bends and distorts light from its [[inner_workings_of_black_holes | accretion disc]], allowing us to observe parts of the disc that are actually behind the [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black hole]] from our perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## Notable Black Holes

### Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*)
Located at the center of our Milky Way galaxy, Sagittarius A* has an estimated mass of 4.3 million times that of our Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Despite its immense mass, if placed in our solar system, it would only extend to about one-fifth of Mercury's average orbit, making it shockingly small relative to its mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### J1650
Considered one of the smallest [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black holes]] ever found, J1650 has a diameter roughly the length of Manhattan but a mass 3.8 times that of our Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### Messier 15 Black Hole
This [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black hole]] is approximately twice the diameter of Earth and has a mass of 4,000 Suns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

### Supermassive Black Hole (Lower Limit)
A [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black hole]] at the lower limit of what is considered supermassive is just under half the diameter of our Sun but possesses about 100,000 times its mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

### M87
The supermassive [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black hole]] in the galaxy M87 weighs 5.4 billion times the mass of our Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. It's so large that our solar system could fit across it approximately four times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. M87 was historically significant as it was the first [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black hole]] from which we obtained a direct image in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### Ton 618
One of the largest [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black holes]] ever discovered, Ton 618 weighs 66 billion times more than our Sun and could accommodate nearly 40 of our solar systems across its expanse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### Phoenix A
Phoenix A potentially holds the record for the most massive [[black_holes_and_their_impact_on_understanding_space_and_time | black hole]] discovered, with an estimated mass of 100 billion Suns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

The ongoing research into these extreme cosmic objects continues to reveal the hidden structure of reality and push the boundaries of our understanding of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

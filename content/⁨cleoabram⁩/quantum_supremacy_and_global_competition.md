[[introduction_to_quantum_computers | Quantum computers]] are a subject of intense global interest, with nations vying to develop them first due to the "tremendous advantage" they promise, a concept often referred to as "Quantum Supremacy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Governments worldwide are actively "battling it out to build them the fastest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Why the Global Race?

[[introduction_to_quantum_computers | Quantum computers]] are not merely faster versions of existing technology; they are "something totally different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This fundamental difference enables them to tackle problems that are currently beyond the reach of traditional computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. The significance of this technology has prompted a "global race" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

### Key Applications Driving Competition

While [[potential_applications_of_quantum_computing | quantum computers]] hold promise for "simulating nature" to develop new materials and medicines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>, a major driver of global concern and competition revolves around their potential impact on encryption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

### The Encryption Challenge

A fully functional [[introduction_to_quantum_computers | quantum computer]] could possess "code breaking capabilities that could render all forms of online encryption unreliable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. This concern stems from Shor's Algorithm, the first major algorithm developed for [[introduction_to_quantum_computers | quantum computers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

Shor's Algorithm can efficiently find prime factors for very large numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. This is critical because "RSA encryption," which forms the basis for "all transactions on the internet," relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers with classical computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. Cracking RSA encryption with a brute-force classical algorithm would take "billions of years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>, whereas a [[introduction_to_quantum_computers | quantum computer]] could potentially do it in "hours to days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

> "Whoever gets a [[introduction_to_quantum_computers | quantum computer]] to actually do this has a big, obvious advantage." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>

## Current Status and Future Outlook

While the ability to break current internet security using [[introduction_to_quantum_computers | quantum computers]] is not yet a reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>, significant progress is being made. As of the video's recording, IBM held the record with a 433-qubit quantum computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. Breaking RSA encryption would likely require "a million qubits or more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

Despite the gap, experts are confident that the necessary advancements will occur sooner than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. It is predicted that within "five or even less years," people will start "switching over to quantum safe algorithms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. The progression of [[introduction_to_quantum_computers | quantum computing]] technology is described as "incredibly fast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>, with problems being solved that were previously considered intractable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

> "Nothing mathematically or physically prevents it. And so if the physics says it's allowed, the engineers will find a way." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>

The development of [[introduction_to_quantum_computers | quantum computing]] is seen as a continuous process, constantly improving and discovering "new applications that we haven't even considered yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, akin to exploring a "bottomless ocean" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

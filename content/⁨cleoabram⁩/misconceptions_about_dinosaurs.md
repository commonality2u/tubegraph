Many common beliefs about dinosaurs are either wrong or outdated, particularly with the [[new_discoveries_in_dinosaur_paleontology | ongoing "Golden Age of dinosaur discovery"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Scientists are discovering new species at an unprecedented rate, averaging one new species per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, which is continually reshaping our understanding of these ancient animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Dinosaur Appearance and Size

[[Anatomy and appearance of dinosaurs | Our understanding of what dinosaurs looked like]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a> has changed significantly:

*   **Velociraptors** were not as large as depicted in "Jurassic Park" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. New research shows they had feathers, a discovery made possible by findings in China in 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Tyrannosaurus Rex (T-Rex)** was initially depicted as a lean predator standing upright like a kangaroo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. However, comparisons of hip and thigh bones to modern upright animals, combined with new computer models, indicate that leaning forward was much more stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. They were more like "teeter-totters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **General build**: Most dinosaurs, including the T-Rex, were much chunkier than previously thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. This means the T-Rex was likely an ambush predator rather than a pursuit predator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   **"Shrink-wrapping"**: Early science illustrators often "shrink-wrapped" dinosaur skin directly around the skeleton, neglecting muscle and fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. This made animals like zebras, baboons, and hippos appear monstrous if treated the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. Today, artists and scientists add loose skin, muscles, and fatty tissues for more realistic depictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.
*   **Color**: While skin doesn't preserve color, some feathered dinosaurs did preserve pigment in their feathers, revealing colors like black and white, or rust/deep red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. Shading found on skin impressions suggests some dinosaurs had stripes, though their specific colors are unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. Reconstructions often draw from the coloration of modern animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

## Dinosaur Timeline and Coexistence

A common misconception is that all dinosaurs lived at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   Dinosaurs ruled the Earth for an immense period of 180 million years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   Some dinosaurs thought to have coexisted were actually separated by millions of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. For example, more time separates the Stegosaurus from the T-Rex than separates the T-Rex from humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. The Stegosaurus was an "ancient relic" to the T-Rex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

## What Qualifies as a Dinosaur?

*   Not all ancient reptiles that lived during the time of dinosaurs were dinosaurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
    *   **Pterosaurs** (flying reptiles), **Mosasaurs**, **Plesiosaurs**, and **Ichthyosaurs** (marine reptiles) are often mistaken for dinosaurs but belong to different groups of reptiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. Crocodiles were also alive then but branched off earlier and are not dinosaurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
*   **Birds are dinosaurs**: Scientifically, birds descended from the same phylogenetic branch as dinosaurs and are considered actual dinosaurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. This means dinosaurs are still alive today, all around us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

## Fossilization

What are commonly called dinosaur "bones" are not bone in the modern sense; they are **fossils** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.
*   Dinosaur bones are made of rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
*   Over millions of years, the original bone material is replaced, cell by cell, by minerals, creating an exact copy of the bone in rock form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. Every dinosaur skeleton in a museum is a stone replica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

## Dinosaur Extinction

The idea that all dinosaurs went extinct is a [[dinosaur_extinction_and_survival | common misconception]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>, as birds (dinosaurs) survived.

*   The mass extinction event 66.04 million years ago was caused by a massive rock, wider than Mount Everest, hitting Earth at high speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.
*   The immediate impact created an apocalypse, including a thermal pulse (a wave of heat) and mega-tsunamis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>.
*   For those that survived the initial impact, the worst was still to come: ejecta from the impact blocked out the sun, leading to the death of plants and the collapse of the food chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.
*   Survival depended on size and refugia: only animals the size of a German Shepherd or smaller, or those that could go into water or live underground, were able to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.
*   The extinction of the larger dinosaurs paved the way for the rise of mammals, including humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

## Ongoing Discoveries

Paleontology is in a "Golden Age," with much still unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>. [[ongoing_research_and_future_of_paleontology | Continued research and technological advancements]] will likely unlock many more mysteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. Studying Earth's past, including dinosaurs, helps us understand our present and future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.

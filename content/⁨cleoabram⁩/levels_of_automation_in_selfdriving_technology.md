The perception of [[current_state_of_selfdriving_cars | self-driving cars]] has often been one of perpetual futurity, with promises of their arrival always "in another few years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. However, recent developments, particularly in cities like San Francisco, suggest that fully driverless vehicles are already here, albeit not in the singular, go-anywhere sci-fi version many anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

## A Graded Progression

The journey toward full self-driving capabilities is not a sudden, binary switch, but rather a long, evolving road with many intermediate stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. This progression has been underway for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>, leading to a categorization system for different levels of self-driving-ness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

### Historical Milestones
*   **Mid-1900s:** Introduction of basic cruise control, allowing drivers to set a speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.
*   **Early 2000s:** Cars began offering assistance in critical moments, such as emergency braking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.
*   **More Recent:** Continuous support features like lane centering and adaptive cruise control, which matches the speed of the car in front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

### Standardized Levels of Automation
The industry categorizes autonomy into distinct levels:

*   **Level 0: Momentary Help** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>
*   **Level 1: More Continuous Support** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>
*   **Level 2: Newer Highway Piloting Systems** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a> – This level represents the current limit of most commercially available cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. At these levels, humans remain very much in charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.
*   **Higher Levels (3-5):**
    *   **Level 3:** The human would primarily monitor the car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
    *   **Level 4:** The car would be fully in charge, but only in specific situations or designated areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.
    *   **Level 5:** The car would be entirely in charge anywhere, any time, even with a sleeping occupant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

While Level 5, the "single go-anywhere sci-fi version," is not yet close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>, Level 4 is already a reality in constrained environments, with [[challenges_and_developments_in_urban_selfdriving_taxis | self-driving taxis]] picking up passengers in cities like San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

## Two Competing Near Futures

The current landscape of self-driving technology involves two distinct approaches, both operating within the "full self-driving but within constraints" level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>:

1.  **Less Complex, Anywhere vs. More Complex, Geographically Constrained:**
    *   Some companies focus on training vehicles to drive in less complex situations, like highways, where they can operate almost anywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.
    *   Others, like Cruise, tackle more complex urban environments but with geographic constraints, meaning vehicles must be trained specifically for those areas and cannot be dropped into a new city without further development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

2.  **Carrying People vs. Carrying Goods:**
    *   **[[challenges_and_developments_in_urban_selfdriving_taxis | Robotaxis]] (Carrying People in Complex Areas):** Companies like Cruise offer driverless ride-hailing services in cities, exemplified by their "Bolt" cars and the future "Origin" vehicle, which will remove components like steering wheels and pedals as they are no longer needed by a driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>. In these vehicles, occupants are in the backseat and cannot take control, as human interference would likely worsen the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>.
    *   **[[future_of_autonomous_trucking_and_delivery_robots | Autonomous Trucking]] and Delivery Robots (Carrying Goods):**
        *   **Delivery Robots:** Used in cities without carrying people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>.
        *   **Long-Distance Autonomous Trucking:** Operates on highways without carrying people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>. This vision is touted to profoundly impact the movement of goods globally, with autonomous trucks being as different from human-driven ones as excavators are from a hundred people with shovels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.

## Real-World Interactions and [[impact_of_selfdriving_cars_on_society_and_transportation | Societal Impact]]

The deployment of self-driving technology in the real world has led to unique and sometimes humorous challenges, highlighting the "messy middle" of technological integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>.

*   **Passenger Behavior:** [[challenges_and_developments_in_urban_selfdriving_taxis | Driverless taxis]] have encountered situations where passengers fall asleep, requiring customer support to remotely check on them via audio detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.
*   **Police Interaction:** A notable viral incident involved a driverless car being pulled over by police. The vehicle, programmed to find a safe place to pull over, slowly moved across an intersection after officers momentarily walked away and turned off sirens, leading to confusion and amusement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. This demonstrated the complex system of audio and visual detection working, but also the nuances of human-machine interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.

Looking ahead, the [[impact_of_selfdriving_cars_on_society_and_transportation | broader societal impact]] of autonomous vehicles is anticipated to be profound. In the longer term, human driving might be seen as "barbaric" due to the inherent risks of human error and the significant time spent behind the wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>. Autonomous technology promises to give people back significant amounts of time, which could be transformative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.

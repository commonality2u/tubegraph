This article details the construction and operation of a Farnsworth fusor, a compact device capable of achieving [[Nuclear fusion basics | nuclear fusion]] on a small scale, as demonstrated in a home workshop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## What is a Fusor?

A fusor is a very compact, small device designed to achieve a certain amount of [[Basics of nuclear fusion | fusion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Unlike commercial-scale [[Fusion reactors and techniques | fusion reactors]] that aim to generate electricity, a fusor is primarily an experimental or demonstration device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## [[Basics of nuclear fusion | Nuclear Fusion]] Principles

At its core, [[Basics of nuclear fusion | nuclear fusion]] involves forcing two particles together at very high energies to fuse and form a heavier particle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This process requires high voltages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

The Sun achieves [[Basics of nuclear fusion | fusion]] through "gravitational confinement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Humans primarily pursue two broad categories for [[Basics of nuclear fusion | fusion]]:
*   **Magnetic Confinement**: Uses magnets to confine plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Examples include stellarators, Helion's cylindrical devices, and tokamaks (which have a d-shaped cross-section) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Inertial Confinement**: Involves pushing plasma close together, for example, using lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

The Farnsworth fusor utilizes **[[Electrostatic inertial confinement in fusion devices | electrostatic inertial confinement]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. In this method, deuterium ions (a neutron and a proton) are streamed spherically from all angles towards a central core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. As they collide in the core, they fuse to form helium-4 (two protons and two neutrons), releasing significant energy as heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Each [[Basics of nuclear fusion | fusion]] reaction produces tremendously more energy than it took to fuse them together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### [[Challenges of nuclear fusion | Challenges of Fusion]]

A key [[Challenges of nuclear fusion | challenge with fusion]] is achieving net energy gain for the entire system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. While the atomic reaction itself releases enormous energy, the difficulty lies in generating more total electricity from the system (including electronics, pumps, etc.) than what is put in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Building the Fusor: A Step-by-Step Overview

Building a fusor requires careful assembly and adherence to safety protocols due to the high voltages involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. David, a nuclear [[Fusion reactors and techniques | fusion]] expert from Helion, instructed the builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

### Key Components and Setup

*   **Vacuum Chamber**: All [[Fusion reactors and techniques | fusion devices]] require a vacuum chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Turbo Pump**: Used to rotate the vacuum chamber and evacuate air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Roughing Pump**: Another component for removing air from the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Deuterium Fuel**: The specific fuel used for this type of [[Basics of nuclear fusion | fusion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **High Voltage Power Supply**: Essential for initiating the [[Basics of nuclear fusion | fusion]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### Construction and Operation Steps

1.  **Preparation**: Install necessary components and put on safety gloves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
2.  **Vacuuming**:
    *   Plug in the roughing pump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
    *   Open valves to suck air out of both pumps and the chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
    *   Ensure the system is sealed; leaks can hinder the vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Fusion cannot occur with air molecules in the chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
3.  **Introducing Fuel**: Slowly introduce the deuterium fuel into the chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. A lot of [[Basics of nuclear fusion | fusion]] operation involves listening to the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
4.  **Powering Up**:
    *   Connect the high voltage power supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
    *   Gradually increase voltage (e.g., 1000 volts, 2000 volts, up to 6000 volts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
    *   Maintain low current once plasma starts to flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
5.  **Plasma Formation and Control**:
    *   Finely adjust the gas control to sustain the plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
    *   The color observed is a fuchsia, a combination of blue and red photons from the deuterium plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
    *   The plasma appears as ions focusing and blasting into a central core, forming more plasma as they hit things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
    *   Optimal temperature must be maintained long enough to confirm [[Basics of nuclear fusion | fusion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

### Troubleshooting During Operation

*   **Breaker Tripping**: A popped breaker can cause power loss and allow air to leak back into the vacuum chamber, necessitating a restart of the vacuuming process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Gas Control**: Over-adjusting the gas gauge can cause the plasma to jump around, preventing stable operation. Fine control is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

## Confirming Fusion

When the system reaches the right densities, pressures, and voltage with pure deuterium, [[Basics of nuclear fusion | fusion]] is confirmed to be occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. This happens particularly in the pinch points and core of the plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Observers primarily identify [[Basics of nuclear fusion | fusion]] by knowing the temperature and energy of the particles, inferring that collisions at those conditions must result in [[Basics of nuclear fusion | fusion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## [[Comparison between smallscale fusors and commercial fusion reactors | DIY Fusion vs. Commercial Fusion]]

The DIY fusor built is not a commercial electricity system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Commercial electricity systems will be larger and more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. However, the rate of technological progress in [[Fusion reactors and techniques | fusion]] means that private companies and governments are now building systems capable of commercial levels of [[Basics of nuclear fusion | fusion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. There is growing belief that [[Energy potential of fusion | electricity from fusion]] could be on the grid within our lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

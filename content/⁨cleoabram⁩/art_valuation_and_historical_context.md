The valuation of art, particularly digital art and [[understanding_nfts_and_their_value | NFTs]], often leads to questions about how such high prices are justified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. While explanations often focus on underlying [[understanding_nfts_and_their_value | blockchain technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, a deeper understanding requires examining the historical context of how art has been valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## The Scull Auction of 1973: A Turning Point

On October 18, 1973, a pivotal event in the art world took place in New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Hosted by collectors Robert and Ethel Scull, who were known for their in-depth collection of living artists like Warhol and Rauschenberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, this auction at Sotheby’s changed the art world forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. It marked the first time that living artists' works sold for tens of millions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

This shift was met with significant backlash, similar to the contemporary criticism of [[understanding_nfts_and_their_value | NFTs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Critics felt it represented an unseemly "marriage between art and money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Artist Robert Rauschenberg even engaged in a fistfight during the auction, dismayed that his work, originally sold for $900, was reselling for $85,000 without him receiving any profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This event fundamentally "exploded art prices forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## The Rise of the Celebrity Artist

The 1973 auction was a crucial moment when living artists began to achieve [[impact_of_celebrity_culture_on_art_prices | celebrity]] status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Andy Warhol, active in the 1960s, notably used [[impact_of_celebrity_culture_on_art_prices | celebrity]] as his medium, becoming as famous as the celebrities he depicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

When art's value becomes tied more to the artist's personal [[impact_of_celebrity_culture_on_art_prices | celebrity]] or the conceptual ideas behind the art, rather than the physical object itself, its valuation becomes "untethered from other benchmarks of value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Traditional metrics like production cost, time spent, or aesthetic appeal become less relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Instead, the question becomes: "How much is that idea worth?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Since this period, art prices have consistently risen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Redefining Art

Along with skyrocketing prices, the very definition of what constitutes "art" expanded dramatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Art can now include:
*   Text phrases displayed publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>
*   A pile of candy meant to be eaten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>
*   A banana taped to a wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>
*   Instructions for creating the art yourself, as seen in the work of Sol LeWitt, whose wall drawings are site-specific and created on location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

Artists like Andy Warhol deliberately blurred the lines of originality and authorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Warhol himself stated, "I think it would be great if more people took up silk screens so that no one would know whether my picture was mine or someone else's" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Appropriation artist Elaine Sturtevant, who copied works by Warhol and Jasper Johns, even received Warhol's own silkscreen to create her appropriations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This engagement with what is original versus what is a copy is central to understanding Warhol's art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

When art becomes more about branding, concept, hype, ego, speculation, and investment, these dynamics apply to all forms of art, not just the avant-garde <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

## Art Valuation Today: Concepts and Certificates

While concerns about money laundering and fraud exist in the art world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, a more profound aspect of art valuation is that some individuals genuinely pay for the concept behind the art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. In these cases, what is owned is the fact of having made the purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. For certain conceptual works, like Sol LeWitt's wall drawings, the physical drawing is not the artwork; the **certificate** is the artwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Without this certificate, the artwork holds no value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## [[Understanding NFTs and their value | NFTs]] and the Modern Art Market

The core difference between [[understanding_nfts_and_their_value | NFTs]] and earlier forms of art is not *why* they have value, but *who decides* that value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. With [[understanding_nfts_and_their_value | NFTs]], a new group of people is excited about a new form of art, challenging the traditional art critics who might dismiss their value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

[[Understanding NFTs and their value | NFTs]] allow for the ownership of digital images through a shared database, often utilizing [[understanding_nfts_and_their_value | blockchain technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This database acts as a critical mass of agreement on who owns what <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Even if an image can be easily screenshotted, the value resides in the recognized ownership record on this agreed-upon database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. The concept mirrors the traditional art world's reliance on certificates; just as a certificate validates a conceptual artwork, the [[understanding_nfts_and_their_value | blockchain]] validates an [[understanding_nfts_and_their_value | NFT]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### The "Original" in an Age of Copies

The concept of originality is fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. For example, an art collective bought an Andy Warhol drawing for $20,000, made 999 exact copies, mixed them with the original, and sold each for $250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Most people would likely pay more for an "original" if it came with a certificate, driven by a desire for uniqueness or potential resale value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. This demonstrates that "value" is an incredibly flexible idea, even for those outside the traditional art world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

When people question the [[understanding_nfts_and_their_value | value]] of [[understanding_nfts_and_their_value | NFTs]] by saying, "I can just screenshot that," they are echoing questions the art world has contemplated for decades: "What is value? Where does it come from? What is too much, for too little?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. [[Understanding NFTs and their value | NFTs]] simply take these questions to an extreme by involving more money, no physical product, and decentralized decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

Despite the discomfort some feel regarding the high prices of [[understanding_nfts_and_their_value | NFTs]] for digital images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>, they are part of a much broader context of art itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. They represent a new medium and canvas for a new generation of artists creating exclusively with digital platforms in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. In essence, [[understanding_nfts_and_their_value | NFTs]] offer a clearer reflection of our own perceptions of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

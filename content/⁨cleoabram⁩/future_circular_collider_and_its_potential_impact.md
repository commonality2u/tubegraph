The Future Circular Collider (FCC) is a proposed scientific experiment that would be significantly larger and deeper than the [[CERN and the Large Hadron Collider|Large Hadron Collider (LHC)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. Located near Geneva, Switzerland, it is envisioned as a new particle accelerator designed to explore the fundamental fabric of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>, potentially revealing answers to some of the biggest unanswered questions in physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:46">[01:46:46]</a>.

## Purpose of a Bigger Collider

The [[CERN and the Large Hadron Collider|LHC]], operated by [[CERN and the Large Hadron Collider|CERN]], is the biggest science experiment ever built, involving thousands of people from over a hundred countries, costing $5 billion, and taking over 30 years to plan and build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. Its primary purpose is to smash particles smaller than atoms together at nearly the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>, creating conditions similar to the early universe after the Big Bang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:34">[06:34:34]</a>.

The energy released from these collisions can transform into physical mass, potentially creating mysterious or unknown particles that are fundamental building blocks of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:59">[06:59:59]</a>. This pure research aims to understand the "elementary particles" – the indivisible components of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:53">[07:53:53]</a>.

One major achievement of the [[CERN and the Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] was the reliable creation and detection of the Higgs Boson, often called the "God Particle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:56">[09:56:56]</a>. This confirmed the existence of an underlying field that gives other particles mass, helping to understand "why stuff exists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:03">[09:03:03]</a>.

Despite these successes, some scientists argue that the [[CERN and the Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] might have reached a limit on what it can uncover, and significant mysteries about the universe remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:46">[11:46:46]</a>. Therefore, the proposal for a much larger collider, the FCC, has emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:51">[11:51:51]</a>.

### Key Unanswered Questions

A primary motivation for the FCC is to address the "big, big holes in our understanding of the universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:01">[12:01:01]</a>, particularly regarding:
*   **Dark Matter:** Scientists have measured that there is something out there that only acts through gravitation, referred to as dark matter or "invisible matter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:12">[12:12:12]</a>. It accounts for 27% of our universe, evidenced by its gravitational effects on visible phenomena like light bending around galaxies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:26">[12:26:26]</a>. While there is no guarantee, a bigger collider might help learn about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:36">[12:36:36]</a>.

## Scale and Cost

The Future Circular Collider (FCC) is currently estimated to cost approximately $17 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>. Instead of the [[CERN and the Large Hadron Collider|LHC]]'s 27 km loop, the FCC would feature a 100 km loop, more than three times the size and twice as deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:06">[13:06:06]</a>.

## Debate and Potential Impact

The proposal for the FCC has sparked a significant debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:56">[11:56:56]</a>.

### Arguments for the FCC

*   **Fundamental Understanding:** The core purpose is pure research to understand the fundamental laws governing the universe, where we came from, and what we are made of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:32">[08:32:32]</a>.
*   **Unforeseen Discoveries:** Supporters argue that a new, more powerful collider might reveal something entirely unexpected, posing new questions and leading to unknown discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:41">[12:41:41]</a>.
*   **Historical Precedent for Advancements:** [[advancements_and_applications_from_cern_research|Pure science]] conducted at [[CERN and the Large Hadron Collider|CERN]] has historically led to numerous practical [[advancements_and_applications_from_cern_research|advancements and applications]], including:
    *   New therapies for cancer treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:32">[13:32:32]</a>
    *   Better medical imaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:33">[13:33:33]</a>
    *   More efficient electric cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:35">[13:35:35]</a>
    *   More sensitive radiation detectors used in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:37">[13:37:37]</a>
    *   The World Wide Web, which originated as a communication tool for scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:43">[13:43:43]</a>
    *   It is believed that a better understanding of how particles work could lead to new [[technological_advancements_and_future_potential|technologies that change our lives]] in 20, 30, or 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:15">[11:15:15]</a>.
*   **Not a "False Choice":** Advocates contend that spending on fundamental research is not a choice *instead* of applied research; rather, it is essential foundational work, like elementary school to higher education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42:42">[14:42:42]</a>.

### Arguments Against the FCC

*   **High Cost:** The estimated $17 billion price tag is a significant concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>.
*   **Diminishing Returns/Energy Requirements:** Some argue that the [[CERN and the Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] has fallen short of some hopes, and certain predictions suggest that even the FCC might not have enough energy to produce truly new discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:11">[13:11:11]</a>.
*   **Alternative Investments:** There's a perspective that money could be spent on other research that more directly improves people's lives today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:32">[14:32:32]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Despite the challenges and debates, pursuing pure research like the FCC is seen by many as crucial for humanity's long-term progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:15">[14:15:15]</a>. Discovering the building blocks of reality today allows future generations to build upon that knowledge in unimagined ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:03">[11:03:03]</a>. The effort put into such endeavors today can lead to a world that is currently beyond imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:03">[16:03:03]</a>. It reflects humanity's innate desire to learn, understand, and improve, leaving behind monuments dedicated to knowledge for any future observers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:23:23">[15:23:23]</a>.

[[Gene editing and CRISPR technology | Gene editing]] technology now offers the power to edit human genes while alive, potentially curing diseases, preventing others, boosting physical capabilities, or even endowing future generations with novel abilities, effectively placing evolution into human hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This is not science fiction; the technology, known as [[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | CRISPR]] or [[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | CRISPR-Cas9]], is already being used in medicine, plants, and animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Jennifer Doudna won the Nobel Prize for its discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Deciding how to use this "superpower" represents one of humanity's greatest challenges and opportunities to reduce suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## The Dawn of Gene Editing

For over a century, scientists have understood that cells carry genetic information in a four-part code, which acts as a blueprint for making proteins that govern our appearance, thoughts, and disease resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. However, for most of that time, this genetic code could only be read, not changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

### CRISPR: A Revolutionary Leap

Early forms of [[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | gene manipulation]] derived from studying how viruses naturally insert into DNA, like HIV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Subsequent tools, such as Zinc-finger nucleases and TALEN proteins, proved that DNA manipulation was possible and powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. The challenge with these earlier methods was that they were "bespoke" – each change required a custom tool, making them expensive and time-consuming to produce and deploy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

[[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | CRISPR]] emerged from the natural world, discovered through studying how viruses and bacteria used proteins directed by RNA molecules to interact with and easily recode DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This key insight made [[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | CRISPR]] a programmable tool that can be directed to essentially any DNA sequence, allowing for targeted, precise, and easily controllable changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. It transformed gene manipulation from slow, one-off changes to quick, precise editing, akin to a text editor for life's instruction manual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## Profound Implications of Gene Editing

The ability to manipulate DNA sequences with [[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | CRISPR]] has profound implications, ranging from making crops more resilient to drought to altering heritable traits in human embryos for future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. As human beings, we now possess the technology to chemically and fundamentally change who and what we are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. The question is no longer *whether* we can change our genes, but *how* should we? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

### Somatic vs. Germline Editing

A critical distinction in the [[ethical_debates_and_societal_implications | ethical debate]] is between editing somatic cells (not involved in reproduction) and germline cells (which pass changes to future generations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Editing germline cells raises significant [[ethical_debates_and_societal_implications | ethical concerns]] due to concepts like eugenics and the permanence of changes for all future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Embryos cannot consent to these changes, and such alterations could potentially change the entire genetic makeup of human populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

### Spectrum of Intervention: From Curing to Enhancing

The potential uses of [[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | CRISPR]] fall along a spectrum, from treating agreed-upon diseases to preventing future ones, and even to what some might call "enhancements" or "super enhancements" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

#### 1. Treating Diseases

A significant success of the [[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | CRISPR]] field is its application in treating [[applications_of_crispr_in_human_health | sickle cell disease]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. In late 2023, the FDA and its UK counterpart approved a [[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | CRISPR]]-based therapy for [[applications_of_crispr_in_human_health | sickle cell disease]] patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. This "one-and-done" therapy suppresses the effect of the disease-causing mutation by reactivating fetal hemoglobin production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Patients like Victoria Gray, the first US patient to receive this treatment, have not had another sickle cell crisis since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Current Challenges
> While "extraordinary," this therapy is currently very expensive and requires hospitalization for a bone marrow transplant, limiting global access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Researchers are working to make it more accessible and deliverable within the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. [[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | CRISPR]] is well-suited for single-gene disorders like [[applications_of_crispr_in_human_health | sickle cell disease]] but far more challenging for complex diseases like schizophrenia, which involve hundreds of mutations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

A major hurdle for broader application is the delivery of [[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | CRISPR]] molecules into specific cells or organs (e.g., lungs, liver, brain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. The goal is to target only affected cells, which is tricky due to the body's complex cellular "zip codes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. Scientists are studying how viruses efficiently target cells for inspiration in developing better delivery methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. The liver, for example, is easier to target because it naturally filters molecules, and lipid nanoparticles (like those used in COVID vaccines) are being explored for delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>.

#### 2. Preventing Future Diseases

[[applications_of_crispr_in_human_health | Huntington's disease]], a severe neurodegenerative disorder caused by a single gene, is a potential target for germline editing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. Removing this disease-causing mutation from an embryo could prevent both the individual and their future descendants from inheriting the trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. While this would be "amazing," current limitations in controlling DNA repair in embryos mean it is not yet safe or ready for clinical use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

> [!WARNING] The Case of HIV Prevention
> In 2018, a scientist controversially edited human embryos to prevent HIV transmission, resulting in the birth of babies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. This decision was widely opposed due to several [[ethical_debates_and_societal_implications | ethical considerations]]:
> *   **Risk vs. Reward**: The risks to the children were deemed greater than the rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.
> *   **Lack of Testing**: The technology had not been tested in animals prior to human application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.
> *   **Existing Alternatives**: Well-known and safe treatments already existed to prevent HIV transmission in children born to HIV-positive parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>.
> *   **Imprecise Edits**: The genome editing was not "clean," resulting in "chimeras" (mixtures of different genetic makeups) in the embryos, with unknown long-term effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>.

This case highlights the tension between the desire to alleviate suffering and the need for rigorous safety and [[ethical_debates_and_societal_implications | ethical considerations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. Charles Sabine, a Huntington's victim, eloquently stated, "Anyone who has had to actually face the reality of one of these diseases is not going to have a remote compunction about thinking there is any moral issue at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. This underscores the profound human drive for cures when faced with devastating illness.

Preventative [[applications_of_crispr_in_human_health | gene editing]] is also being explored for common conditions like high cholesterol related to the PCSK9 gene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>. A clinical trial is underway to use [[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | CRISPR]] as a preventative measure to edit liver DNA, potentially avoiding the need for daily medication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>.

#### 3. Enhancements and "Super Enhancements"

This category raises significant [[ethical_debates_and_societal_implications | ethical concerns]]. Examples of potential "enhancements" include genes related to building larger muscles (MSTN) or needing less sleep (DEEC2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. Another interesting area is altering pain perception, where natural genetic variations exist that confer pain tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. The line between "health-related" modifications and "enhancements" is a "gray area" and hard to draw, leading to questions of who decides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.

> [!INFO] The "Gene Gap" and Accessibility
> A major [[future_implications_and_challenges_of_genetic_modification | societal concern]] is the potential for a "gene gap" or divide based on wealth or other factors, creating a world akin to the movie *Gattaca* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>. However, many argue that this shouldn't halt development, as historically, expensive technologies become more accessible over time (e.g., personal computers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>. The motivation remains to make these therapies widely available in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>.

Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in conjunction with in vitro fertilization (IVF) already allows for embryo selection to screen out disease-causing mutations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>. While PGD selects existing embryos, [[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | CRISPR]] could actively edit embryos to introduce or remove traits, even if those traits are present in all available embryos for a couple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>. IVF processes themselves are difficult, time-consuming, and expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>.

Regarding "super enhancements"—moving people beyond what is currently possible—such as healing faster, extending life, or conferring "superpowers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>:
*   **Scientific Limitations**: These are largely unrealistic at present because the genetics are not well understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>. Genes are interconnected, meaning tweaking one thing likely affects many others, making unintended health consequences a major concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>.
*   **Need for Research**: Extensive research is required before considering such manipulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>.

## Applications Beyond Humans

The most immediate global impact of [[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | CRISPR]] is expected to be in plants and animals, as experimentation and deployment are less restricted than in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:24">[00:38:24]</a>.

### 1. Plants

[[crispr_in_agriculture_and_environmental_impact | CRISPR]] allows for targeted, precise changes in plants, altering only one trait without affecting others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. Unlike traditional plant breeding, which involves random genetic changes over decades, [[crispr_in_agriculture_and_environmental_impact | CRISPR]] can modify multiple genes simultaneously, leading to sophisticated alterations in one shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> *   In Japan, a [[crispr_in_agriculture_and_environmental_impact | CRISPR]]-edited tomato with higher nutritional value has been approved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>.
> *   Non-browning mushrooms have been created using [[crispr_in_agriculture_and_environmental_impact | CRISPR]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>.
> *   Higher-yielding tomato plants have been developed without changes to taste or appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>.

In the U.S., the Department of Agriculture has ruled that [[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | CRISPR]] changes in plants that could theoretically be achieved through traditional breeding (albeit over decades) are *not* considered genetically modified and are *not* regulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. This means such crops are likely to appear in grocery stores in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>.

### 2. Animals for Climate Change and Human Health

[[ethical_and_ecological_considerations_for_altering_species_to_regulate_the_atmosphere | CRISPR]] is being used to address climate change by editing the microbiome of animals, specifically to reduce methane emissions from cattle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>. Methane from cattle, produced by gut bacteria, is a significant greenhouse gas contributor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>. [[gene_editing_for_enhanced_carbon_capture_in_trees | CRISPR]] can target specific bacteria and genes to alter their metabolism permanently, reducing methane and potentially increasing nutrient generation for the animal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>. The goal is to develop an easily deployable method, like a pill given once, to edit the microbiome sustainably over the animal's lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>.

Similarly, editing the human microbiome holds promise for health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>. Research suggests a correlation between microbiome-produced molecules and susceptibility to diseases like asthma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>. [[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | CRISPR]] could potentially turn down the production of such molecules to prevent asthma in children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>. Other areas of interest include the connection between the microbiome and the brain, and the microbiome and the immune system, particularly regarding inflammation and susceptibility to diseases like Alzheimer's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>.

## Navigating the Future of Gene Editing

> [!IMPORTANT]
> "Few technologies are inherently good or bad. What matters is how we use them. And when it comes to [[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | CRISPR]], the possibilities of this new technology, good and bad, are limited only by our imaginations. I firmly believe we can use it for the former and not the latter. But I’m also cognizant that this will require determination from us individually and collectively. As a species, we have never done anything like this before. But then again, we've never had the tools to do it. The power to control our species' genetic future is awesome and terrifying. Deciding how to handle it may be the biggest challenge we have ever faced. I hope, I believe, that we're up to the task." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>

The development of [[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | CRISPR]] underscores that science is a human endeavor driven by curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a>. Fundamental breakthroughs often arise from simple questions like "I wonder how something works," leading to transformative tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:56">[00:48:56]</a>. Continued support for curiosity-driven science is crucial for future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:48">[00:49:48]</a>.

The ability to control our species' genetic future is both "awesome and terrifying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>. The [[future_implications_and_challenges_of_genetic_modification | ethical considerations and controversies surrounding robot dogs]] and [[ethical_and_ecological_considerations_for_altering_species_to_regulate_the_atmosphere | ethical and ecological considerations for altering species to regulate the atmosphere]] mirror the complex decisions humanity faces with [[gene_editing_and_crispr_technology | genome editing]]. The biggest challenge ahead will be deciding how to handle this unprecedented power, with hope and belief that humanity is up to the task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>.

[[Disney Imagineering and its role in innovative technologies | Walt Disney Imagineering]] (WDI) consistently pushes the boundaries of [[technological advancements and future potential | technology]] not for utility, but to enhance human happiness and create emotional connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>. This unique approach leads to cutting-edge innovations with various future applications in entertainment and beyond.

## Character Droids (BDX Units)
The latest BDX units developed by Imagineers are designed with personality at their core, aiming to evoke a sense of cuteness and approachability rather than just functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. While not intended for household chores or factory work, their design signifies a shift in how humans might interact with [[the future impact of humanoid robots on human society | robots]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

Instead of being solely rewarded for achieving a goal, these droids are trained through reinforcement learning to also follow specific animations, much like characters in a Disney movie, making their movements appear natural and endearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. This focus on emotional design suggests a future where [[the role of robotics and animatronics in Disney parks | robots]] in public spaces, such as Disney parks, could be primarily for character interaction and immersive experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

## The Realistic Lightsaber
The world's most realistic, expandable lightsaber, developed by Imagineer Lanny Smoot, showcases Disney's commitment to bringing fantasy to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. It achieves its smooth extension through internal motors unrolling translucent tapes lined with LEDs, creating a rigid, glowing blade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>. While this specific prop is for performance and not battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>, its existence as a real-life, retracting blade is a significant step in [[the creation and development of Disneys realistic lightsaber | prop technology]], enhancing the realism of live performances in parks like Star Wars Galaxy's Edge. It exemplifies how advanced mechanical and lighting [[technological advancements and future potential | technology]] can create compelling [[advancements in immersive experiences | immersive experiences]].

## Holotile
Disney's Holotile, also invented by Lanny Smoot, is an omnidirectional treadmill that allows users to walk in any direction while remaining in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>. The surface is composed of rotating circular tiles, where one gear controls overall spin and another controls the angle of the tile's head, creating a force that pushes the user back to the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>. Lidar cameras continuously scan the user's feet and shin bones to track movement and direction, informing the system how to adjust the tiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>.

Currently, Imagineers are testing designs and playing games on the Holotile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>. Its future applications may include use in Disney parks for interactive attractions or in film production environments like "the Volume" (where Star Wars is filmed) to allow actors to move freely within virtual sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>. This [[technological advancements and future potential | technology]] holds promise for creating more realistic and boundless virtual reality experiences.

## Stuntronics
Stuntronics are advanced robot stunt doubles, exemplified by the Spider-Man robot that performs maneuvers too dangerous or impossible for human stunt performers, including pulling up to 10 G's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>. These robots were developed by repeatedly flinging a metal stick with motors and actuators, gradually making it more human-like through iterative learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>.

While currently used for live performances in parks, Imagineers are open to using stuntronics for other applications, including potentially in movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>. This highlights a future where [[the role of robotics and animatronics in Disney parks | advanced robotics]] can seamlessly integrate into various entertainment forms, pushing the limits of what's possible in live shows and cinematic experiences.

## The Overarching Purpose of Disney's Tech
For Disney, the primary purpose of all this [[technological advancements and future potential | incredible technology]] is to tell stories and immerse the audience and guests in a world where they can feel something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>. As expressed by Josh D'Amaro (Head of Disney Parks) and Kevin Feige (President of Marvel Studios), Imagineering plays a crucial role in bringing stories from their creative teams to life in real, tangible forms, often extending film sets into the parks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:23:00">[15:23:00]</a>.

This philosophy underpins the future application of all Disney's technological innovations. They are not merely tools for convenience or longevity, but instruments designed to evoke joy and allow people to experience the wonder of being a kid again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>. The future of Disney's [[technological advancements and future potential | technology]] lies in its continued dedication to [[Disneys use of tech for storytelling and emotional connection | storytelling and emotional connection]], constantly finding new ways to make magic feel real.

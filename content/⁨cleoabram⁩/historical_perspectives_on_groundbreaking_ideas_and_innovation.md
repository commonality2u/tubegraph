A new show titled "Let Me Explain" aims to provide journalistically rigorous and genuinely optimistic explanations about technology and ideas that could significantly impact lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The show will feature deep dives into ideas that have the potential to be "HUGE" if they come to fruition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, exploring what a world where these ideas succeed would look like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

The creator, a video journalist who previously worked for Vox, covering tech and economics for shows like Netflix's *Explained* and Vox's YouTube channel, as well as their own TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, decided to launch this independent project to tackle topics in a more personal and experimental way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

## The Pattern of Innovation Perception

The inspiration for this new approach came from an old newspaper article published on October 9th, 1903, titled "Flying Machines Which Do Not Fly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The article posited that it would take "from one million to ten million years" for a truly flying machine to evolve, essentially telling inventors to "give up already!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Remarkably, just two months later, the Wright brothers made their famous assisted flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

This anecdote highlights a recurring pattern in how groundbreaking ideas are discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>:
*   "It's not possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>
*   "It's too expensive, they can't get the cost down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>
*   "Do people really need that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>
*   "Oh, it's just a fad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>
*   And finally, "Oh my god, it changed the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>

Journalists often lean towards stories that deem new ideas implausible, partly because these narratives are easier to tell and resonate with readers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Addressing Modern Pessimism

This historical perspective raises a critical question: What opportunities are being missed today due to a similar pessimistic outlook? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a> While many current technologies and policies are in the news, it's uncertain which will genuinely improve lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. However, some *will* succeed, and there is a need for journalists to more rigorously engage with that possibility sooner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

A prevailing sense of pessimism, particularly on platforms like TikTok, suggests that the world is worsening and becoming an undesirable place to live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This feeling is fueled by real problems, a lack of perceived solutions, and significant "lucrative fear mongering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. The consequence is widespread political nihilism, economic fear, and a constant sense of dread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

While a journalist's role includes skepticism, pointing out challenges, and highlighting potential pitfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, there's also a responsibility to help people imagine "what could go right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

The new show aims to foster an [[importance_of_optimistic_visions_for_future_innovation|optimistic point of view]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. By imagining a world where major ideas succeed, it seeks to better guide new tools early on and collectively course-correct before issues arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This approach hopes to empower individuals to feel that they can contribute to making the world better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

The show will feature insights from experts like Matt Yglesias, David Roberts, and Dr. Tia Jackson-Bey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, as well as fellow journalists like Johnny Harris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, and engage with the audience to explore topics that cause pessimism and seek solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

The [[debate_on_technology_in_sports | debate on technology in sports]] often centers on when athletic gear becomes so advanced that it constitutes "cheating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as "tech doping," which involves using physical equipment to gain an unfair advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. While technology continuously pushes human capabilities forward, the challenge lies in defining the boundary between acceptable innovation and unfair enhancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This discussion extends beyond sports, reflecting broader questions about humanity's relationship with [[technology advancements in sports tracking and data collection | technological advancements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Criteria for Banning Technology

When considering whether to ban specific technology in sports, regulators typically ask two main questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>:

1.  **Is it dangerous to athletes or fans?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>
    *   This is a primary reason for banning substances like steroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
    *   It also applies to hardware, such as aluminum bats in Major League Baseball, which are banned because they could allow players to hit the ball with such force as to cause severe injury or death to those on the field or in the stands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Most modern sports tech, however, improves performance without increasing danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

2.  **Is it against the spirit of the sport?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>
    *   This criterion is intentionally vague, leading to further sub-questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>:
        *   Can everyone use this technology? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>
        *   Is it fair to record holders? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>
        *   Does it artificially enhance a player's performance? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>

## Case Studies in Athletic Technology

### Swimming Gear

*   **Goggles**: At the 1972 Olympics, goggles were not worn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. They were allowed four years later, leading to a significant spike in swimming records as early adopters began winning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Most people now view allowing goggles as a positive development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Speedo LZR Racer (2008)**: Speedo collaborated with NASA to create the LZR racer swimsuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This suit featured fabric mimicking shark skin, panels that streamlined swimmers' bodies, and reportedly aided buoyancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. It enabled swimmers to break numerous world records, including [[Michael Phelps | Michael Phelps']] historic eight gold medals at the 2008 Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The swimming world expressed outrage, with some suggesting records achieved with the suit should not count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Within a year, the governing body banned the suits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Olympic swimmers are now restricted to suits made of textile fabrics covering specific body areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Other Sports Examples

*   **Prescription Lenses in Olympic Shooting**: Allowed, as they correct a disability (poor vision) without enhancing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   **Sticky Glue for Football**: Banned by the NFL, while grippy gloves are allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This highlights the subjective nature of what constitutes an unfair grip.

### Running Shoes

The [[debate_on_technology_in_sports | debate on technology in sports]] surrounding running shoes is particularly complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

*   **Eliud Kipchoge's Sub-2 Hour Marathon (2019)**: Eliud Kipchoge became the first person to run a marathon in under two hours while wearing prototype shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Studies indicated these shoes helped runners achieve 2-3% faster speeds than other top shoes, leading regulators to argue they threatened the sport's integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **"Super Shoes" Design**: Modern "super shoes" have three main sections: the upper (holds the foot), the outsole (hits the ground), and the midsole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The midsole is crucial for "energy return," maximizing the rebound force to boost the runner's next stride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
    *   Nike's super shoes, for example, achieve high energy return through a tall stack of cushy foam, a carbon fiber plate acting as a lever, and special air pockets for bounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
    *   Before super shoes, a good energy return rate was 60-65%; with super shoes, it's around 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Impact and Regulation**: The introduction of super shoes led to significant increases in marathon times, prompting complaints that they provided runners with energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. However, the energy must still come from the runner; the shoes simply return more of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Regulators implemented rules: a 40mm foam height limit and a maximum of one carbon fiber plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. Additionally, shoes must be available for public purchase at least four months before competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Nike initially resisted these rules, arguing they would stifle innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. The head of Nike's sport research lab stated their moral obligation is to keep pushing forward human potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

## Technology as Part of the Body: Prosthetics

A significant aspect of the [[ethical and philosophical_questions_surrounding_technology_in_sports | ethical and philosophical questions surrounding technology in sports]] arises when the technology becomes an integral part of an athlete's body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

*   **Oscar Pistorius and Blake Leeper**: Oscar Pistorius was the first person to qualify and compete in the Olympics with running blades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Years later, Blake Leeper, who also uses running blades, qualified for the Olympics but was not allowed to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. This reignited the [[prosthetics_in_competitive_sports | prosthetics in competitive sports]] debate: are blades a correction for a disability (like glasses) or an enhancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>?
*   **Testing and Controversy**: Extensive testing showed Leeper's blades did not make him faster at sprinting or improve endurance, but they did hinder acceleration and cornering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. Opponents argued prosthetics are lighter and require less oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
*   **The MASH Rule**: The Olympics ultimately cited the "max allowable standing height" (MASH) rule, which was not used for Pistorius, to prevent Leeper from competing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. This rule meant his blades made him taller than his theoretical natural height, calculated from other body measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. The calculations themselves were based on small studies of white and Asian men, raising concerns about fairness and applicability to all athletes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Leeper was told to reduce his blade height by six inches, which would significantly alter his running mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.
*   **Underlying Fear**: The core concern in this [[debate_over_technology_versus_human_error_in_sports_officiating | debate over technology versus human error in sports officiating]] is the fear that blades will become so advanced that athletes using them could outperform able-bodied competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. This represents a "Pandora's Box" scenario regarding [[ethical implications of genetic modifications | human enhancement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[ethics of technological advancements in athletics | ethics of technological advancements in athletics]] involve ongoing questions about how far and in what direction technology should push human potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. While technology aims to make lives easier and expand human capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>, the challenge lies in regulating it without stifling innovation or preventing athletes from reaching their full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. This tension between progress and fair play will continue to shape the future of sports and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

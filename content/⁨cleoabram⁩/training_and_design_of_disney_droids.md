[[Disney Imagineering and innovation | Walt Disney Imagineering]] develops "adorable little droids," known as BDX units, designed to bring joy to people through technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. These droids prioritize personality and cuteness over typical utility, distinguishing them from robots designed for tasks like navigating uneven ground, opening doors, or working in factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Design Philosophy
The droids' perceived cuteness is a result of specific design and engineering decisions, influencing everything from their walk to small movements like a "shimmy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. The goal of [[Disney Imagineering and innovation | Imagineering]] projects is not for guests to notice the [[Technological advancements and future potential of robot dogs | technology]], but rather to "fall in love with a character and feel things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This focus on emotional connection makes their [[Technological advancements and future potential of robot dogs | robotics development]] distinct from general robotic applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

## Training Methodology
Unlike fully autonomous robots, Disney's droids are controlled by a person holding a console who tells them *what* to do (e.g., walk here, throw a tantrum) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. The *how* of their response comes down to their extensive training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

1.  **Inspiration and Animation:** [[Disney Imagineering and innovation | Imagineers]] drew inspiration from ducklings and created a series of animations, much like those used in Disney movies, to define how the robot should walk, jump, or shimmy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
2.  **Digital Simulation and Reinforcement Learning:** A digital version of the robot is placed in a simulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. They utilize [[Ethical Considerations in Robotics and AI | reinforcement learning]], a common training method where robots are rewarded for meeting goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. However, for these droids, the reward system has two objectives: successfully performing the action (e.g., walking from A to B) and adhering closely to the predefined "cute" animations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
    *   Thousands of digital robots try different movements in simulations, stumbling and learning, allowing for vastly more repetitions than in the physical world without damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
3.  **Physical Testing:** Once trained digitally, the learning is uploaded to the physical robots, which are then tested using harnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Eventually, these droids may appear walking around in Disney parks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Human Interaction
The design and [[Technological advancements and future potential of robot dogs | training]] of these droids highlight the importance of [[Human Robot Interaction and Emotional Responses | human emotion]] in [[Development of Humanoid Robots by Companies | robotics]]. How humans feel about a robot, whether it is perceived as cute or well-intentioned versus scary, significantly impacts their willingness to interact with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

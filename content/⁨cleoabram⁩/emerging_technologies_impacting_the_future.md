Over the past two years, the show *Huge If True* has explored various new ideas and technologies with the potential to transform the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This exploration includes topics such as [[Technological advancements and future potential of robot dogs | humanoid robots]], quantum computers, new supersonic planes, and [[Impacts of CERN research on technology and society | particle colliders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The fundamental belief behind these explorations is that envisioning better futures increases their likelihood of coming true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Huge Conversations

To delve deeper into these subjects, a new series, *Huge Conversations*, has been introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This series features [[interviews_with_tech_innovators_shaping_the_future | longer form, more in-depth, optimistic conversations]] with individuals whose ideas are actively shaping the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. These innovators are building tools and envisioning futures that could soon impact billions of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### Focus on Success and Impact
Unlike much of the media that often focuses on past or potential failures in technology development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, *Huge Conversations* centers on the question: "What if they succeed?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The aim is to understand how these technologies might improve things and solve important problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

It is acknowledged that technological progress can sometimes lead to new challenges, with many current issues being a direct result of past advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Therefore, the discussions aim to grapple with both the "promise and the perils" of these visions becoming reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### The Optimistic Lens
An [[importance_of_optimistic_visions_for_future_innovation | optimistic lens]] is considered essential for engaging with these future scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. While not necessarily agreeing with every vision presented, the goal is to clearly understand what innovators are imagining, allowing the audience to decide if they wish to contribute to building that future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

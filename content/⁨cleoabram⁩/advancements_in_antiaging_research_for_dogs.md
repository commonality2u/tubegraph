It often seems cruel that dogs live significantly shorter lives than humans, causing their owners to frequently experience loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. However, new anti-aging efforts are now emerging specifically for dogs, offering hope for extending their lifespans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Debunking the "Seven Dog Years" Myth

For a long time, the common belief was that one human year equated to seven "dog years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This rule suggested a dog at two years old was like a 14-year-old teenager, and at 10 years old, a 70-year-old distinguished gentleman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Vets refer to this as "the myth that never dies," clarifying that it is not based on any [[scientific_research_on_canine_and_human_aging | scientific research]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. It likely arose from the rough observation that humans live to about 70 and dogs to about 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

A more [[scientific_research_on_canine_and_human_aging | scientific way]] to compare dog and human ages now exists, based on [[scientific_research_on_canine_and_human_aging | research]] by geneticists at UC San Diego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This research reveals a non-linear aging process:
*   A one-year-old dog is roughly equivalent to a 30-year-old person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   A 14-year-old dog is only equivalent to a 70-year-old person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

This implies that dogs age faster than humans when they are young, and slower when they are old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Conversely, humans age slower when young and faster when old compared to dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Quantifying Aging

A core goal of companies like Loyal, founded by Celine Halioua, is to develop a comprehensive quantified aging process to better understand and potentially slow aging in dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

The current understanding of aging suggests it's a process of various types of cellular damage accruing over time, eventually leading to diseases in later life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Many age-related diseases stem from this underlying damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Methylation Clocks

One method of measuring aging involves examining changes to DNA, specifically through a process called "methylation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Methylation refers to modifications on DNA that change its shape, and these modifications are thought to change predictably with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

The [[scientific_research_on_canine_and_human_aging | research]] that produced the new age comparison chart analyzed methylation in Labrador DNA collected over 16 years and compared it to human DNA from individuals aged 1 to 103 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. This deeper insight helps understand the biological processes underlying visible signs of aging like thinning hair and wrinkles, and more importantly, conditions like frailty, cancer, and disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## The [[the_impact_of_dog_breed_size_on_longevity | Impact of Dog Breed Size on Longevity]]

Dog breeds exhibit surprisingly different lifespans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. For instance, a Great Dane might live 6-8 years, while a Chihuahua can live over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Generally, larger dogs live shorter lives than small dogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

This phenomenon is largely attributed to human selective breeding, which has inadvertently selected for genetics causing growth issues in larger breeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. While dogs of all sizes are born at similar sizes, larger dogs experience a much faster metabolic growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. It's believed that the mechanisms driving rapid growth in puppies don't fully "turn off" or function correctly once the dog is fully grown, leading to faster aging and shorter lifespans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

Studying this difference is crucial because small dogs seem to hold a key to longer doggy life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## Loyal's Research and Future Prospects

Loyal is specifically focused on understanding the internal biological differences *between* dog breeds, particularly concerning their metabolism, to develop targeted treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Their aim is to make the metabolism of a large dog more akin to that of a small dog, potentially extending their healthy lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

While still in the research phase, investigating which specific areas can be targeted with particular drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, Loyal's broader mission is to introduce drugs that enable dogs to live longer, healthier lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. In doing so, they also hope to gain knowledge about aging that can eventually benefit humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

## Current Limitations and Future Hopes

Currently, there is no readily available pill that can significantly extend a dog's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. However, the ongoing [[scientific_research_on_canine_and_human_aging | scientific research]] represents crucial progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

Even without a "big anti-aging solution yet," dog owners can still take actions to help their dogs live longer, such as providing proper care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. The time spent with dogs is deeply valued, and the hope is for more of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. The ultimate goal for many is to ensure that for a dog's entire life, their human companion is there to care for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

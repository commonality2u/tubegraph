The advent of new telescopic capabilities marks a significant moment in the search for life beyond Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Recent images released by NASA showcase the deepest view ever seen into space and incredibly clear views of stars being born <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. One particular image, though not visually striking, is deemed the most exciting because it reveals how to find aliens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## [[exoplanet_discovery | Exoplanets]] and the Cosmic Census

Currently, approximately 5,000 [[exoplanet_discovery | exoplanets]], or planets outside our solar system, are known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This number is likely much larger, considering that the Kepler telescope was pointed at just one small section of space for four years to find many of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The map of these discovered worlds represents decades of scientific work and tremendous leaps forward in [[technological_advancements_in_astronomy | technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Despite the vast number of discoveries, as far as we know, there is no other life detected in our cosmic neighborhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## The Role of the [[james_webb_space_telescope | James Webb Space Telescope]] (JWST)

The [[james_webb_space_telescope | James Webb Space Telescope]] is poised to change this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. While detecting an [[exoplanet_discovery | exoplanet]] is difficult, determining what exists on it is even harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Identifying [[biosignatures_and_atmospheric_analysis | Biosignatures]]

The JWST has the unprecedented ability to find indicators of life, known as [[biosignatures_and_atmospheric_analysis | biosignatures]], on other planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. For instance, if one could discern that Earth's atmosphere contains 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen from a great distance, there would be a strong likelihood of finding life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This method, however, doesn't necessarily indicate intelligent life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

The process works as follows:
*   When a planet passes between its star and Earth, it causes a tiny dip in the starlight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   This "transit method" has been crucial for locating many [[exoplanet_discovery | exoplanets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   Crucially, not all starlight is blocked during a transit; a small amount passes through the planet's atmosphere on its way to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   Different gases within the atmosphere absorb different kinds of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   The [[james_webb_space_telescope | James Webb Space Telescope]] is powerful enough to detect which types of light are missing, thereby identifying the atmospheric composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   This remarkable capability allows for the detection of "tiny, tiny specks of darkness against tiny, tiny specks of light in the depths of space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## First Discoveries: WASP 96b

Scientists directed the [[james_webb_space_telescope | James Webb Space Telescope]] to analyze WASP 96b <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Light from WASP 96b began its journey 1,150 years ago and only recently reached the telescope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. By analyzing the types of light blocked by its atmosphere, it was determined that WASP 96b's atmosphere contains water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

However, it's important to note that this does not signify the discovery of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. WASP 96b is a hot gas giant with water vapor in a steamy atmosphere, not liquid water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. While water vapor has been detected on other planets closer to Earth (a couple hundred light-years away), the level of detail observed on WASP 96b, over 1,000 light-years away, is astounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## The Beginning of a New Era

This initial data from the JWST serves as a "proof of concept," demonstrating that this method of searching for atmospheric compositions works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This is just the beginning of a potentially revolutionary period in scientific history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Humanity is now actively engaged in seeking out new life and civilizations, exploring what no one has seen before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This endeavor is not science fiction; it is real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. The search for cosmic purpose and a worthy goal may well lie far beyond Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

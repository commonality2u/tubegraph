The Concorde was described as the "world's first ever supersonic commercial flight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> and the "most exciting aircraft the world had ever seen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Designed in the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>, it was a one-of-a-kind supersonic plane that could fly at twice the speed of sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Design Features

The Concorde's distinct appearance was a physical embodiment of the human desire for speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. Its shape was considered futuristic, resembling a child's paper dart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

Key design elements included:
*   **Body** A long, narrow body designed to streamline air resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.
*   **Wings** Very wide, delta-shaped wings to generate lift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.
*   **Nose** A distinctive long nose, known as the "droop snoot," which could droop during takeoff and landing to improve pilot visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
*   **Engines** Special, powerful engines capable of handling rapid incoming air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.
*   **Paint** Unique paint that discharged heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. This was a special anti-static paint that prevented static electricity from building up as the plane moved through the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>.

## Operational Performance

The Concorde was renowned for its speed and unique flight experience:
*   **Speed** It could travel at 1,350 mph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>, which is approximately twice the speed of sound (Mach 1, around 767 mph) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. For context, this top speed is roughly equivalent to a military F-16 fighter jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.
*   **Travel Time** A flight from New York to London took only 3.5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>, compared to 7 hours today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.
*   **Altitude** It flew at such a high altitude that passengers could see the curvature of the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>, specifically "on the edge of space where the sky got darker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. At its cruising speed, it was traveling faster than the Earth rotates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.
*   **Passenger Experience** Inside the plane, there was no physical indication of going through the sound barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>. An indicator was placed in the cabin to inform customers when they were flying supersonic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. Passengers could also enjoy champagne during the flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

## The Sonic Boom

A defining characteristic of supersonic flight, including the Concorde's, was the sonic boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
*   **Mechanism** As a plane flies, it pushes air out of its path, creating pressure waves at the front and back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. When a plane exceeds the speed of sound, air molecules cannot move out of the way in time, causing them to compress and form waves off the front and back of the aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. When these pressure waves reach human ears, they are processed as a loud boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.
*   **Characteristics** The sonic boom is not a single event when the plane hits the speed of sound; it "booooooooms the whole time all along the path of the plane, carpeting the ground below it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. For those on the ground, the Concorde's sonic boom was loud, comparable to just below a balloon pop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.

## Retirement of the Concorde

Despite its advancements, the Concorde was ultimately unable to overcome the problem of the sonic boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. Several factors led to its retirement:
*   **Regulations** In 1973, the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) banned commercial supersonic flights over the United States due to the loudness of the sonic booms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. Similar rules were adopted worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. This severely restricted routes, primarily limiting them to flights over the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.
*   **Economics** The Concorde's engines were "fuel guzzling," and rising fuel costs contributed to its economic challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.
*   **Accident** A deadly crash in 2000 significantly hurt public perception of supersonic flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.
*   **Cessation of Flights** Air France eventually chose to stop flying the Concorde, which then forced British Airways, the only remaining company covering maintenance costs for the aging planes, to also cease operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. The Concorde fleet was officially retired on April 10, 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.

While the Concorde was ahead of its time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>, its challenges highlighted the need for future [[Challenges faced by supersonic planes|supersonic planes]] to be quieter, more sustainable, and more affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>. [[NASAs X59 supersonic plane development|NASA's X-59 supersonic plane development]] aims to address the sonic boom issue to potentially bring back commercial supersonic flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

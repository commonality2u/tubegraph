The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the largest science experiment ever built, located on the border between France and Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It is housed in a huge underground tunnel over 100 meters deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> and 27 kilometers long, running beneath homes, businesses, and farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The LHC is the most famous particle smasher within CERN, the biggest physics lab in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Construction and Scale

Planning and building this underground particle smasher took thousands of people from over a hundred different countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, cost $5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, and spanned over 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The sheer scale of the detectors, like the Atlas detector, is immense, towering over people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Components for the detector were lowered in through a shaft and then constructed in place, similar to building a ship in a bottle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## How the LHC Works

Inside the 27 km tunnel, there's a long blue tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> that contains two pipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. These pipes are kept colder and emptier than outer space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Down these pipes, particles smaller than atoms are fired in opposite directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, pushed faster and faster until they are almost at the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. They then smash together, sending subatomic debris into massive detectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

The collision point itself is tiny, within a beam pipe about the diameter of an orange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Thousands of magnets along the pipes force the particles into a space the width of a human hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. The particles being accelerated are protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### Scale of Particles

To grasp the scale:
*   If a single strand of human hair were as wide as the entire Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   A single cell inside that hair would be like the distance from Paris to Rome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   A protein inside that cell would be like six soccer fields across <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   An atom inside that protein would be like one school bus across <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   The nucleus at the center of that atom would be like the width of a grain of rice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   The protons within that nucleus would be like grains of salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

Therefore, a proton compared to the width of your hair is like a grain of salt compared to the entire Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Collision Frequency

To ensure collisions with such tiny particles, the LHC fires 100 billion protons in bunches in each direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Out of these 100 billion vs. 100 billion, on average, only about 50 or 60 collisions occur per crossing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. The process is repeated 30 million times per second, with approximately 3,000 bunches, each containing over 100 billion protons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## [[purpose_and_significance_of_particle_colliders | Purpose of Particle Colliders]]

The primary [[purpose_and_significance_of_particle_colliders | purpose]] of smashing protons together is to get a glimpse at what might have happened close to the start of our universe, the Big Bang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. These collisions release an enormous amount of energy for how small protons are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. A fundamental principle of physics is that energy and mass are related, meaning this released energy can turn into physical mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. If the energy is high enough, it can turn into mysterious or unknown particles, which are considered more of the building blocks of our universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

These "mystery particles" exist for only an instant before turning back into more everyday particles that fly outward to hit sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Scientists analyze where these particles hit the sensors, then use complex physics to "reverse engineer" what happened at the moment of collision and what mystery particles could have been present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### Elementary Particles and The Standard Model

Particle physics aims to understand the fabric of the universe by dividing matter until it reaches elementary particles – the fundamental building blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. Many elementary particles, like electrons and photons, are already known due to decades of experimentation and complex mathematical predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This mathematical description of how humans believe the world works is called The Standard Model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### [[discovery_of_the_higgs_boson | Discovery of the Higgs Boson]]

One major reason the LHC was built was to search for a mystery particle predicted by the Standard Model: the [[discovery_of_the_higgs_boson | Higgs Boson]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Also known as the "God Particle," it was theorized to confirm the existence of an underlying field that gives other particles mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Observing the Higgs Boson would help understand "why stuff exists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. To create it, enough energy was needed in one place, which could be achieved by smashing two protons together at nearly the speed of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

After the LHC was built, thousands of scientists collected data for two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. In 2012, they announced they had reliably created and detected the Higgs Boson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This proof appeared as a "bump on a chart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, confirming the mathematical prediction that if the Higgs Boson exists, a bump would be seen when particles are smashed together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

## [[impacts_of_cern_research_on_technology and society | Impact and Future of Research]]

The [[discovery_of_the_higgs_boson | Higgs Boson]] confirmation did not immediately change the world, but it validated that humanity is on the right track in understanding the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Discovering fundamental building blocks of reality now allows future generations to build with them in unimagined ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. The LHC has profoundly shaped our understanding of elementary particle interactions and rigorously tested existing theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

### [[challenges_and_future_of_particle_physics_research | Challenges and Future of Particle Physics Research]]

Some scientists argue that the LHC may have reached its limit for new discoveries, and there's still much unknown about the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. This has led to a debate about building an even bigger particle collider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

One major gap in understanding is dark matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>, an "invisible matter" that affects gravitationally but doesn't emit anything visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. Dark matter accounts for 27% of our universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. While there's no guarantee a bigger collider would find dark matter, it might answer new questions or reveal unexpected discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

The proposed "Future Circular Collider" (FCC) is estimated to cost roughly $17 billion and would have a 100 km loop, compared to the LHC's 27 km <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. However, not everyone agrees on its necessity, with arguments that the LHC fell short of some hopes and that even more energy might be needed to produce truly new discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Other ideas for future colliders include a muon collider, a linear collider, and a powerful collider proposed in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

### Byproducts of Pure Science

The pure scientific research conducted at CERN, including the development of the LHC, has already led to significant [[impacts_of_cern_research_on_technology_and_society | technological byproducts]]:
*   New therapies for cancer treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>
*   Better medical imaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>
*   More efficient electric cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>
*   More sensitive radiation detectors used in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>
*   The World Wide Web, a new way for scientists to communicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>

Fundamental research is considered essential for applied research, akin to kindergarten being necessary for higher education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. Investing in such pure research demonstrates humanity's commitment to seeking knowledge and understanding our place in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

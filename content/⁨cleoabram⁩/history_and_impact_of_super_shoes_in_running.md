Super shoes are a type of athletic footwear that has significantly impacted distance running, leading to numerous broken records and sparking [[controversies_over_advanced_sports_gear | debates]] about fairness and [[technological_doping_in_sports | technological doping]] in sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The central question surrounding them is when sports gear becomes so effective that it constitutes cheating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Evolution of Running Footwear

Historically, running shoes have evolved significantly. Early running shoes resembled loafers with spikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Modern running shoes allow athletes to run much faster than these early designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Over the last 100 years, running shoes have seen improvements far exceeding the 2-3% gain attributed to super shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## The Rise of Super Shoes

The current debate intensified with the introduction of specific shoe designs by Nike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. In 2019, Eliud Kipchoge became the first person to run a marathon in under 2 hours, achieving a pace of 4 minutes and 35 seconds per mile for 26.2 miles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This feat was considered impossible by many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. He wore special prototype shoes built to enhance speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Studies indicated that this design allowed runners to go 2 to 3% faster than the next fastest shoe available at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This performance immediately led regulators to claim that the shoe threatened the integrity of the sport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### Key Components of Super Shoes

Most modern super shoes share three key sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>:
*   **Upper:** Holds the foot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **Outsole:** The part that makes contact with the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **Midsole:** Crucial for "energy return," determining how much energy a runner exerts into the ground is returned to boost their next stride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

Nike's super shoes specifically maximize energy return through several features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>:
*   **Tall Stack of Cushy Foam:** A significantly taller stack of new, soft foam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Carbon Fiber Plate:** A carbon fiber plate acts as a lever, springing the runner forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   **Air Pockets:** Some designs include special air pockets for additional bounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

Before super shoes, a good energy return rate was around 60-65%; with super shoes, it is now closer to 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. It's important to note that "energy return" means reusing a runner's own energy, not providing new energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

## Impact on Records and Regulations

Upon their introduction, super shoes led to runners breaking world records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Marathon times, in particular, saw their biggest increase in 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

Regulators ultimately adopted a middle-ground approach to managing super shoe technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>:
*   **Foam Height Limit:** A 40 mm foam height limit was implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   **Carbon Fiber Plate Limit:** Shoes cannot have more than one carbon fiber plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   **Commercial Availability:** All shoes used in competition must be available for anyone to buy at least four months prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. This rule was added because Kipchoge's record-breaking shoes were prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

Nike initially expressed dissatisfaction with these rules, stating they would [[historical_perspectives_on_groundbreaking_ideas_and_innovation | stifle innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. However, the head of Nike's sport research lab later articulated that their moral obligation is to keep pushing forward, with the goal of enhancing human potential rather than simply providing external advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

## Broader Implications

The debate surrounding super shoes mirrors larger discussions about the role of technology in all aspects of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. Technology is designed to make people better, lives easier, and achieve previously impossible feats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. The question of how far and how fast technology should push human capabilities remains a persistent debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

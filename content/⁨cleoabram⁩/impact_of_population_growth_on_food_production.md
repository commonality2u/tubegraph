The world is currently experiencing one of the most pivotal moments in food history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. New technologies, such as machines that burn weeds with lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, robots that break up grain bin chunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, and self-driving tractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, are emerging as part of what experts call the [[fourth_agricultural_revolution | Fourth Agricultural Revolution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This revolution is crucial because the world's population is exploding, necessitating a significant increase in food output to feed a growing number of people while also protecting the Earth long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## The Population Challenge

Human population growth has seen dramatic shifts over history:
*   **12,000 years ago**: The total human population was roughly half the size of New York City's current population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **2,000 years ago**: Approximately 230 million people inhabited the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Today**: The global population stands at 8.1 billion people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Near Future**: It is projected to reach 9 billion in just 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, peaking at 10.3 billion by 2084 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

To keep up with current population and feed these new people, experts estimate that food output needs to increase by more than 50% by 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Despite a plummet in the amount of land used to grow food per person, humans have become significantly more efficient at farming, largely due to advancements in tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Agricultural Revolutions: A Historical Perspective

The way humans produce food has transformed dramatically over time:
*   **First Agricultural Revolution**: Marked by the invention of farming, leading to the seed of modern civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Second Agricultural Revolution**: Farming became a large-scale business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Third Agricultural Revolution**: Between 1950 and 1970, this revolution aimed to solve widespread hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. It introduced new chemicals for pest and weed control and popularized "monocropping" – focusing resources on one plant per field year after year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. While saving lives, monocropping came at a cost:
    *   It harms soil over time, making future food growth more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
    *   Pesticides and herbicides cause health problems for people and crucial animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
    *   Modern farming places significant strain on water resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

To feed an additional 2 billion people and mitigate the problems created by previous solutions, experts suggest a five-step approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Strategies to Address Future Food Needs

### Step One: Freeze Land Use

Historically, increasing food production meant clearing more land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. However, an area the size of South America has already been cleared for farming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Nearly all new food for the growing population must come from existing land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### Step Two: Grow More on Existing Land

Increasing output on current land involves controversial yet effective solutions:
*   **Farm Robots**: These are transforming agriculture by increasing work speed, adapting to various weather conditions, and operating at different times of day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Robots are now capable of picking soft fruits, a task previously requiring human touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Smarter Machines**: Large-scale agricultural equipment is becoming highly advanced.
    *   **Self-Driving Tractors**: These vehicles can till soil and perform other tasks autonomously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. They follow pre-programmed routes, avoid obstacles, and use precise GPS technology (accurate to within 1 inch) to optimize efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This "precision agriculture" reduces "dead spots" (missed areas) and "overlap" (areas hit twice), maximizing output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
    *   **High-Speed Planters**: These machines plant seeds at speeds up to 10 mph, with some able to plant 720 seeds per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. They precisely control seed depth and spacing, ensuring plants don't compete for resources and receive enough moisture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. This precision can increase crop yield by up to 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Step Three: Use Resources More Wisely

Modern technology allows for more efficient use of inputs like fertilizer, herbicide, and pesticide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **"See and Spray" Technology**: These 120-foot wide, 18-ton machines use machine learning and computer vision (Nvidia GPUs) to differentiate weeds from plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. They create detailed maps of millions of crops and apply tiny squirts of herbicide only to weeds, dramatically reducing chemical usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Some versions eliminate chemicals entirely, using lasers or physical force to destroy weeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
*   **Precision Technology Benefits**: Broadly, precision agriculture helps farmers use fewer chemicals, less fertilizer, and less water to produce large volumes of food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. This technology also has the potential to revive older, more [[sustainable_farming_practices_and_challenges | sustainable farming practices]] like "intercropping," where different kinds of plants are grown in the same field, keeping soil healthy, by precisely managing each plant's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

### Step Four: Shift Diets

Only 55% of the world's crop calories directly feed people. The remaining portion feeds livestock, which is a less efficient way to provide food to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Shifting dietary patterns could free up significant resources.

### Step Five: Cut Down on Food Waste

Roughly 25% of the world's total food calories are lost or wasted before consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. Reducing this waste is critical to feeding the growing population.

The [[fourth_agricultural_revolution | Fourth Agricultural Revolution]] aims to address food scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. However, increased reliance on technology presents significant challenges:
*   **Job Displacement**: As automation increases, there are concerns about its impact on existing farm jobs and the nature of those that remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
*   **Farmer Control and Costs**: Companies like John Deere, which produces a large share of agricultural equipment worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, represent issues like high prices, lack of control over equipment, and difficulties with repairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Farmers are advocating for the "right to repair" their own equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.
*   **Complexity**: Despite advancements, the overall farming ecosystem, including labor shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, remains extremely complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

Despite these challenges, humanity has consistently found ways to feed the world at unprecedented scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Continuing to improve how food is grown is vital for the lives of 10 billion people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.

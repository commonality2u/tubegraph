The value of art, particularly in the digital age, is deeply intertwined with concepts of celebrity, hype, speculation, and investment, rather than traditional benchmarks like production cost or time spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This shift has led to artworks selling for millions of dollars, even if they are easily copied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## The Scull Auction of 1973: A Turning Point

A pivotal moment in the [[value_of_art_and_its_evolution | evolution of art valuation]] occurred on October 18, 1973, in New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This event, hosted by collectors Robert and Ethel Scull at [[Sotheby's | Sotheby's]], profoundly changed the art world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The Sculls were among the first prominent collectors to focus "passionately and in depth" on living artists such as [[Andy Warhol | Warhol]], Robert Rauschenberg, and [[Jasper Johns | Jasper Johns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

The auction marked the first time that works by living artists sold for "many tens of millions of dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This surge in prices was met with significant backlash, as many viewed it as an unsavory "marriage between art and money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Artist Robert Rauschenberg notably got into a fistfight during the auction because he was astonished by the price his work commanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Having originally sold the piece for $900, it fetched $85,000 at auction, with Rauschenberg receiving none of the profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## The Rise of the Artist as Celebrity

The 1973 auction was a "moment that changed everything" because it coincided with the emergence of living artists as celebrities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. [[Andy Warhol | Andy Warhol]] was a prime example of this phenomenon in the 1960s; for him, "celebrity was his medium" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Eventually, Warhol himself became as famous, if not more famous, than the celebrities he depicted in his artworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

When art's value becomes more about the artist's personal celebrity or the conceptual ideas behind the art, it becomes disconnected from traditional measures of worth, such as production cost, creation time, or aesthetic appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Instead, the question shifts to "How much is that idea worth?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

Since the 1970s, the art market has "entirely exploded," with prices continually rising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This explosion in value has coincided with an expansion of what is considered "art" itself, encompassing diverse forms such as text phrases, a pile of candy, a banana taped to a wall, or even just instructions for making the art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## Originality, Authorship, and Value

The concept of originality also plays a complex role in art valuation. [[Andy Warhol | Andy Warhol]] famously stated, "I think it would be great if more people took up silk screens so that no one would know whether my picture was mine or someone else's" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Artists like Elaine Sturtevant, an appropriation artist, built entire careers on exploring ideas of originality and authorship by copying works by artists such as [[Andy Warhol | Andy Warhol]] and [[Jasper Johns | Jasper Johns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Warhol even provided Sturtevant with his silkscreen so she could make her appropriations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. For Warhol, the question of "what is original and what is a copy?" was integral to understanding his art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

When art functions as branding and concept, it also becomes deeply intertwined with hype, ego, [[how_art_functions_as_investment_and_speculation | speculation, and investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. While concerns about money laundering and fraud exist in the art world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, the underlying reality is that some individuals genuinely pay for the *concept* behind the art, finding value in the very act of ownership and the statement it makes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. For instance, in the case of Sol LeWitt's wall drawings, the physical drawing itself is not the artwork; the artwork is the accompanying certificate, without which it holds no value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

## NFTs: New Deciders of Value

The emergence of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) has brought these long-standing questions about art's value into the public sphere with extreme clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. The core difference between NFTs and previous forms of art is not *why* they have value, but *who decides* that value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. With NFTs, a new group of enthusiasts is defining worth, often challenging the established art critics who previously dictated value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

NFTs derive their value from a shared consensus around a database that records ownership, typically using blockchain technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. While anyone can screenshot or copy a digital image, the NFT represents verifiable ownership within a system that a "critical mass of people agree to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This concept mirrors the "certificate" that validates the ownership and value of traditional conceptual art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

The ability to easily copy or view an NFT without owning it prompts the same questions the art world has grappled with for decades: "What is value? Where does it come from? What is too much, for too little?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. NFTs push these questions further by involving "more money" for "no physical product" where "anyone decides" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. This new medium, creating exclusively with digital in mind, is seen as the "new canvas" for a future generation of artists, revealing collective perceptions of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

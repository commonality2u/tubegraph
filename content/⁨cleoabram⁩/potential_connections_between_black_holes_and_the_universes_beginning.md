Research into [[Black Holes and Their Impact on Understanding Space and Time | black holes]] is helping to unlock deeper questions about the universe as a whole, including its origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:53">[00:57:53]</a>. [[Black Holes and Their Impact on Understanding Space and Time | Black holes]] are seen as a "window" or "Rosetta stone" allowing scientists to translate between different pictures of the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>.

## Singularities and the End/Beginning of Time

In [[Einsteins theory of relativity and black holes | Einstein's theory]], the singularity inside a [[Black Holes and Their Impact on Understanding Space and Time | black hole]] is considered the "end of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:19">[09:19:19]</a>, a point of infinitely distorted space and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:05">[02:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. Likewise, the Big Bang singularity, within the framework of [[Einsteins theory of relativity and black holes | Einstein's theory]] alone, is at the "other end of time" and can be considered the "beginning of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>.

However, these two types of singularities are very different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:34">[01:04:34]</a>. [[Black Holes and Their Impact on Understanding Space and Time | Black holes]] represent maximally scrambled information and are the highest entropy things known in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>. In contrast, one of the great mysteries of the universe's origin is that it began in a very low entropy state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:19">[01:04:19]</a>.

## Quantum Mechanics and the Big Bang

Adding [[Black Holes and Their Impact on Understanding Space and Time | quantum mechanics]] to the discussion of these singularities raises further questions about whether the Big Bang singularity, as traditionally conceived, truly represents the beginning of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:52">[01:04:52]</a>. Theories like [[Hawking radiation and black hole evaporation | Hawking's]] "no boundary idea" challenge conventional understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>. While the understanding of [[Black Holes and Their Impact on Understanding Space and Time | black hole]] singularities and the Big Bang singularity are surely related, neither is fully understood at present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:16">[01:05:16]</a>.

## Holographic Principle and Emergent Spacetime

Research into [[Black Holes and Their Impact on Understanding Space and Time | black holes]] provides hints of a deeper structure of nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:13">[01:05:13]</a>. It suggests that [[Black Holes and Their Impact on Understanding Space and Time | black holes]] "slice through space and leaves the building blocks of space dangling right at the horizon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:24">[01:05:24]</a>, forcing scientists to confront the underlying structure of spacetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:39">[01:05:39]</a>.

The idea that information is encoded on the horizon of a [[Black Holes and Their Impact on Understanding Space and Time | black hole]], rather than its volume, suggests the [[The information paradox and the future of black hole research | holographic principle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. This principle implies that a complete description of a higher-dimensional phenomenon can be encoded on a lower-dimensional surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:13">[00:53:13]</a>. This leads to the concept of "emergent spacetime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>, where spacetime itself arises from a more fundamental description, possibly a network of qubits, similar to what a quantum computer is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:12">[01:06:12]</a>.

This idea, stemming from John Wheeler's "it from bit" concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:31">[01:06:31]</a>, suggests that the universe could be described as a giant quantum computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>, a network of entangled qubits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:18">[01:07:18]</a>. This means there are radically different but equally valid ways of describing the same physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:38">[00:52:38]</a>.

## Cosmological Horizons

While the [[The information paradox and the future of black hole research | holographic principle]] has been mathematically realized for specific "toy models" of space, it's not yet clear if it applies to our universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:30">[01:07:30]</a>. However, the question remains: could the entire universe be described in terms of a quantum theory living on a boundary, perhaps a cosmological horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>? The general guess is yes, but the precise nature of such a boundary and the exact phrasing of the question are still unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>.

Recent research, even using proto-quantum computers, is attempting to explore how space could emerge from entangled qubits, with some papers suggesting the emergence of structures like one-dimensional wormholes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:07">[01:08:07]</a>. These fundamental questions about the nature of space and time themselves indicate the profound depth of [[Black Holes and Their Impact on Understanding Space and Time | black hole]] research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12">[01:09:12]</a>.

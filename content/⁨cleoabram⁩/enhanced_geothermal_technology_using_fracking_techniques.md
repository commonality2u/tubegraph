[[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | Fracking]], or hydraulic fracturing, is a method energy companies use to extract oil and gas stuck inside deep underground rock formations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The process involves drilling into the rock and pumping fluid at high pressure to crack it open, allowing trapped oil and natural gas to escape into pipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Rise of Traditional Fracking
In the mid-2000s, American politicians were focused on reducing the nation's dependence on foreign oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. While fossil fuels like oil and natural gas were typically extracted from deposits about a mile underground, significant reserves were known to be trapped deeper within harder rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This deeper rock represented a path to energy independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The perfection of [[technological_advancements_and_future_potential | technologies]] to fracture these rocks led to the widespread adoption of [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. As a result, the US became the top crude oil producer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, but this increased extraction and burning of fossil fuels came at an environmental cost, contributing to climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## [[environmental_concerns_associated_with_fracking | Environmental Concerns Associated with Fracking]] for Fossil Fuels
[[environmental_concerns_associated_with_fracking | Fracking]] for oil and gas has drawn significant criticism due to several [[environmental_concerns_associated_with_fracking | environmental concerns]]:
*   **Water Pollution**: The fluid used in [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]] contains chemicals that can be harmful to people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Accidents on the surface, especially involving leftover fluids, can pollute drinking water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. While pipe cracks can cause problems, reports suggest this is less likely if operations are correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Earthquakes**: [[environmental_concerns_associated_with_fracking | Fracking]] has been linked to an increase in earthquakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. The primary cause of these seismic events is often attributed not to the fracturing itself, but to the disposal of nasty leftover fluids by injecting them back into the ground, particularly into basement rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Keeping these fluids on the surface is considered more environmentally problematic than injection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Fossil Fuel Reliance**: Even if the immediate environmental concerns are mitigated, traditional [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]] still relies on fossil fuels, which contribute to global warming and face long-term viability challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## [[geothermal_energy_as_a_clean_energy_source | Geothermal Energy: A Clean Alternative]]
Despite the negative associations of [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]], the same underlying technology that was perfected for fossil fuel extraction might be the key to unlocking a vast, clean energy source: [[geothermal_energy_as_a_clean_energy_source | geothermal energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

The Earth's heat content is immense; just 0.1% of it could supply humanity's total energy needs for 2 million years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Traditionally, [[geothermal_energy_as_a_clean_energy_source | geothermal energy]] has been harnessed by tapping into natural hot springs and underground reservoirs of hot water and steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. This involves drilling down to find steam and channeling it through a turbine to generate electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>, or using the heat directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

However, traditional [[geothermal_energy_as_a_clean_energy_source | geothermal energy]] is geographically concentrated, limiting its widespread use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. A huge amount of energy remains trapped deeper underground because it requires finding a natural reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS)
Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) aim to overcome these limitations by artificially creating geothermal reservoirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Conceptually, EGS involves drilling down into hot rock, injecting water, and then cracking the hot rock to allow the water to pass through and heat up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. The heated water is then collected to spin a turbine and generate electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This middle step, cracking the rock with injected fluids, is essentially [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

Professor Mukul Sharma, known as "The Frack King" for his expertise in optimizing hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, is now working on applying this [[technological_advancements_and_future_potential | technology]] to [[geothermal_energy_as_a_clean_energy_source | geothermal energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. He believes this [[technological_advancements_and_future_potential | technology]] will enable [[geothermal_energy_as_a_clean_energy_source | geothermal energy]] to become more commercial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

### Addressing Concerns in EGS
The main environmental objections to traditional [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]] do not apply to [[geothermal_energy_as_a_clean_energy_source | geothermal applications]]:
*   **Fluid Composition**: Unlike oil and gas [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]] which uses chemical-laden fluids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, EGS typically injects environmentally benign fluids, primarily water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Seismic Activity**: While EGS *can* create seismic activity if done poorly, the science has advanced to a point where this risk is considered very tiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Experts believe it can be done safely with proper precautions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_solutions_in_increasing_clean_energy_production | Potential and Future of Geothermal Energy]]
Currently, [[geothermal_energy_as_a_clean_energy_source | geothermal energy]] contributes very little to global electricity generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. While wind and solar power are expected to increase as fossil fuel use declines, a clean energy future requires reliable options that can provide energy consistently, even when weather conditions are unfavorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. [[geothermal_energy_as_a_clean_energy_source | Geothermal energy]] could be a significant contributor due to its reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

While other systems are in development, such as closed-loop systems where no fluids leave the pipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, these systems limit the energy extraction rate because the fluid has less contact with the hot rock compared to fractured rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Therefore, [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]] might help extract significantly more energy from the ground if it can be done safely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

The application of [[fracking_and_its_impact_on_energy_production | fracking]] [[technological_advancements_and_future_potential | technology]] to [[geothermal_energy_as_a_clean_energy_source | geothermal energy]] presents an opportunity to utilize a method that contributed to climate change in a way that helps to fix it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. This transformation highlights that [[technological_advancements_and_future_potential | technology]] itself is neither good nor bad, but its impact depends on how it is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

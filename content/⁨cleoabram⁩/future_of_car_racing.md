Car racing, epitomized by [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]], has long been a showcase for cutting-edge automotive technology and a glimpse into the future of cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. However, an increasing global shift towards [[electric_vehicles_in_racing | electric vehicles]] is challenging the sport's traditional reliance on internal combustion engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This presents an "existential moment" for one of the world's most popular and expensive sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## The Tipping Point: Government Regulations and Outdated Tech

The financial and popular support for [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] stems from major companies investing in and advertising their advanced car technology, essentially using races to demonstrate their manufacturing prowess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. If this technology becomes outdated, the sport risks losing its purpose and investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

A significant shift is underway as governments implement bans on new gas car sales. California has already done so, and the entire European Union plans to follow suit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. By 2040, owning a car with a tailpipe could be comparable to owning a car with a car phone, indicating how quickly technology is advancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This global regulatory push marks a critical moment for motorsports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## The Birth of Formula E: A New Electric Vision

The answer to this challenge emerged from a dinner in Paris 11 years ago, attended by key figures in European politics and motorsports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Attendees included:
*   **Alejandro Agag**: Spanish businessman and former member of the European Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Antonio Tajani**: Former European Commissioner for Transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Jean Todt**: President of the FIA, the governing body for [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

During this dinner, Antonio Tajani emphasized the European Commission's push for electrification, declaring electric as the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. However, directly making [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] electric was not feasible due to technical limitations (batteries couldn't last 305 kilometers/190 miles for two hours 11 years ago) and resistance from incumbent car companies who didn't yet produce [[electric_vehicles_in_racing | electric cars]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This represented a classic innovator's dilemma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

Instead, Jean Todt proposed creating a new, fully electric championship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This led to the creation of [[formula_1_vs_formula_e | Formula E]], launched in 2014, with an exclusive 25-year license for purely electric racing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This license means [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] cannot become fully electric without conflicting with Formula E's agreement, which expires in 2039 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Designing a "Real Life Video Game"
The goal for [[formula_1_vs_formula_e | Formula E]] was to be a "space program for electric cars," pushing [[technological_innovations_in_electric_racing | technology]] as fast as possible while also being entertaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Its creators looked to video games, specifically *Super Mario Kart*, for inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

[[formula_1_vs_formula_e | Formula E]] adopted core [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] mechanics (teams, drivers, points systems) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a> but introduced unique, fan-friendly elements:
*   **City Center Races**: Races are held in urban environments, bringing the show closer to people and promoting electric cars as a solution for city mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Attack Mode**: Drivers can go off the racing line to gain a temporary energy boost, similar to power-ups in a video game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Fan Boost**: The audience votes to give a specific driver extra speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. (Note: This rule is being retired in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>).

These rules, considered "gimmicks" by some in [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]], offer [[formula_1_vs_formula_e | Formula E]] greater flexibility to innovate and entertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

## Advancing Electric Car Technology

[[formula_1_vs_formula_e | Formula E]] cars have undergone significant [[technological_innovations_in_electric_racing | advancements]], reflecting improvements in consumer [[electric_vehicles_in_racing | electric vehicles]]:

*   **Gen 1 (2014)**: The first [[electric_vehicles_in_racing | Formula E]] car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. A key challenge was battery range; drivers had to swap cars mid-race due to limited battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **Gen 2**: Capable of covering twice the distance of Gen 1, allowing drivers to complete an entire race with a single car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Gen 3**: The "fastest and most powerful electric race car ever built" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. It significantly increases power from 250 kilowatts to 350 kilowatts and reduces weight from over 900 kilograms to about 850 kilograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

Crucially, in [[formula_1_vs_formula_e | Formula E]], teams use the same chassis and battery, focusing their innovation on powertrain components like the rear motor, inverter, gearbox, and associated software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. This deliberate design encourages experimentation on key [[technological_innovations_in_electric_racing | technologies]] relevant to road cars and helps manage costs, unlike [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]]'s runaway expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

### Regenerative Braking System
A notable [[technological_innovations_in_electric_racing | innovation]] in the Gen 3 car is the absence of rear mechanical brakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Instead, the car relies on its electric motors for braking, converting kinetic energy back into electrical energy to recharge the batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. This system can recuperate up to 80% of the energy back into the battery during braking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. While challenging to perfect, this [[technological_innovations_in_electric_racing | technology]] has the potential to significantly enhance future road [[electric_vehicles_in_racing | vehicles]] by increasing range, allowing faster driving, and enabling quicker charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

## Formula 1's Response: Hybridization

Around the time [[formula_1_vs_formula_e | Formula E]] was launching, [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] announced its biggest set of rule changes in a generation, embracing hybridization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Every car would now be powered by a hybrid powertrain, combining a turbo engine with two electric motors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This move is consistent with [[future_developments_in_formula_1_engines | Formula 1's impact on car innovation and future trends]], even if it stops short of full electrification due to the exclusive license held by [[formula_1_vs_formula_e | Formula E]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. While [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] could theoretically go 99% electric, it cannot be purely electric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

## The Purpose: Pushing Technology for Everyone

Car racing serves as a massive group science project, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in automotive engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. For the sport to remain relevant and continue its [[formula_1s_impact_on_car_innovation_and_future_trends | impact on car innovation and future trends]], it must align with the future of consumer cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. As combustion cars face bans, unlike horse racing where horses remain legal, racing needs to feature the [[technological_innovations_in_electric_racing | technology]] being sold to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

The ultimate winner in the "fight for the future of cars" is still uncertain, with some suggesting a potential merger between [[introduction_to_formula_1_racing | Formula 1]] and [[formula_1_vs_formula_e | Formula E]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Regardless, both sports are actively working to develop better technology for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

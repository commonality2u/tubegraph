The concept of [[georgism_and_land_value_tax | Georgism]], derived from the 19th-century economist Henry George, suggests that public revenue should be raised primarily through a land value tax, levied on the unimproved value of land. This approach, emphasizing the economic efficiency and equity of taxing natural monopolies rather than labor and capital, brings to light interesting questions about the political feasibility of implementing such a system.

## The Current Political Climate

Implementing Georgism in modern political environments, particularly within democracies, requires careful consideration of both public sentiment and existing economic structures. As of the time of the podcast discussion, there is a noted low salience for land value tax discussions, with minimal public discourse or political momentum in favor. However, as Lars Doucet, an advocate for Georgism, suggests, heightened awareness and discourse could turn the tide, enabling broader acceptance and implementation.

The proposition is particularly attractive when framed as a form of property tax reformâ€”a system many communities are already familiar with, but with potential [[transition_to_a_land_value_tax_system | improvements in fairness and economic efficiency]]. In certain regions like Texas, there's a strong existing sentiment against property taxes, but Doucet warns that removing property taxes altogether could mirror the economic conditions found in areas like California, known for extreme housing costs due to low property tax rates [01:25:22].

## Challenges and Opportunities

One of the fundamental challenges to implementing Georgism is the transitional gain trap, where existing property owners who have bought at high values might resist changes that would decrease their asset values. Doucet acknowledges this concern and suggests a phased approach, starting with revenue-neutral shifts from taxing buildings to taxing land, which could reduce resistance and ease the transition [00:58:02].

On the opportunity side, when presented correctly, a land value tax could gain popularity, particularly at the local level, by clearly demonstrating who benefits and who incurs costs. The prospect of lowering taxes on buildings while maintaining the overall revenue could attract a coalition supporting this form of reform. There is also the ongoing conversation in several U.S. cities about implementing similar systems, which indicates growing interest and potential for practical trials [01:25:07].

## International Perspectives

Looking beyond individual cities and states, there are examples internationally where concepts akin to Georgism are either being considered or have been implemented with success. For instance, Norway has applied principles consistent with Georgist philosophy in its management of natural resources, further suggesting the model's viability in various contexts. These examples serve as encouraging precedents for Georgism's potential adoption elsewhere [01:28:03].

## Conclusion

While implementing Georgism poses challenges, including overcoming entrenched political interests and addressing public perceptions, there presents a pathway forward through local-level experimentation and incremental policy shifts. By carefully aligning policy reform with public and political expectations, and by leveraging successful international models, the Georgist economic framework could potentially play a significant role in shaping future economic policy landscapes.

In advocating for Georgism, proponents must focus on education and awareness, demonstrating clear and tangible benefits, especially to those concerned with current [[economic_impact_of_land_speculation | inequities and inefficiencies]] in taxation. As such, the political feasibility of Georgism, while uncertain, holds promise contingent on strategic advocacy and policy innovation.

Coordination is a complex puzzle, often appearing across different domains such as finance, technology, politics, and more. Burn Hobart, a prolific writer and thinker, delves into this topic in a recent discussion. His insights help illuminate the nature of coordination problems within institutions, using illustrative examples from various sectors, including companies like SpaceX.

## Coordination Challenges

Coordination involves multiple parties working together to solve complex problems. However, many problems can't be solved by a lone genius; they require the concerted effort of various parties, each with their own objectives and constraints. Hobart emphasizes that institutions often face the challenge of aligning these diverse goals to solve overarching problems effectively [[productivity_stagnation_and_technological_advancement | productivity stagnation]], which affects everyone and has long-term consequences.

### Conflicting Goals

Institutions frequently have dual goals which can conflict with one another. For example, a company might have the public mandate to achieve a massive feat like sending humans to Mars, while internally striving to maximize shareholder value. These conflicting goals can create systemic dissonance, making coordination even more challenging [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_educational_innovation_and_technology | systemic dissonance]].

### Institutional Doublespeak

Within organizations, there's often an external story versus an internal narrative. Externally communicated goals might serve strategic purposes such as recruitment or fundraising, whereas the internal focus might differ significantly. Such dual narratives can lead to "doublespeak," where institutions need to maintain two different narratives for various stakeholders [[impact_of_technology_on_government_and_policy | impact of technology]].

Some see it as a way to attract talent and capital, whereas the real objective is to enhance earnings over the long term [[expansion_and_interaction_of_human_populations | the real objective]].

## The Role of Internal Goals

Often, internal goals in institutions are unwritten and implicit, primarily focusing on self-preservation, ongoing relevance, and institutional growth. Amidst solving a particular problem, maintaining one's position and ensuring resource allocation can shape the internal goals in ways that aren't always aligned with the institution's stated mission [[economic_and_political_implications_of_ai | allocation can shape]].

## Addressing Coordination Problems

Despite the pervasive nature of these coordination challenges, Hobart suggests that understanding and studying how people collaborate is essential. Improving coordination could potentially address significant issues such as productivity stagnation, which affects everyone and has long-term consequences [[human_bottlenecks_in_technological_advancement | bottlenecks in technological advancement]].

### Strategies for Improvement

1. **Transparency and Communication**: Maintaining open communication about goals and mandates can help reduce misunderstandings and align efforts.
   
2. **Realigning Incentives**: Ensuring that everyone is working towards the same objectives by aligning incentives can mitigate conflicting priorities.
   
3. **Understanding Trade-offs**: Institutions often need to manage trade-offs between different goals. Acknowledging and understanding these trade-offs can lead to better decision-making.

4. **Learning from Mistakes**: Institutions should embrace a culture of learning and adaptation to continually improve coordination strategies.

## Conclusion

Coordination is inherently complex, involving interwoven goals that often clash. By studying these dynamics, institutions can potentially discover pathways to more effective collaboration, ultimately leading to a more productive and harmonious achievement of diverse objectives. Understanding the coordination puzzle is crucial for navigating the intricate maze of institutional mandates and missions [[impact_of_historical_and_cultural_factors_on_development | historical and cultural factors]].

The mandatory schooling system has been a point of contention for many educators, philosophers, and parents. In a recent episode of the Lunar Society Podcast, Sarah Fitzgerald discusses her views on the current educational framework, drawing notable criticism against how it impacts children and society at large.

## Authoritarian Structure and Coercion

Fitzgerald points out that the schooling system is built on an authoritarian structure. It is an environment where children are coerced for approximately twelve years [[impact_of_coercion_on_child_development | which has significant impacts on their development and creativity]]. This coercion mirrors what she describes as an irrational institution where teachers exert authority, often in a manner that doesn't facilitate true learning. Fitzgerald argues that this system does not help children learn how to solve problems or pursue what genuinely interests them [[noncoercive_education_philosophy | non-coercively]].

## Historical Comparisons

Fitzgerald draws parallels between the current schooling system and historical injustices. She likens the view society has of children today to the historical views of women and black people before their respective emancipations [[rethinking_conventional_views_on_childrens_rights | urging a rethinking of children's rights]]. Despite biological differences between children and adults, Fitzgerald believes that children should not be denied rights based on these differences, as it mirrors this outdated and circular reasoning.

## The Inefficiency and Purpose of Schools

Fitzgerald criticizes the efficiency of schools, arguing that they are not the best environment for learning. She suggests that the conventional schooling model is a lingering relic designed to produce obedient factory workers rather than innovative thinkers [[technological_and_social_innovation | crucial for modern innovation]] in a modern, knowledge-based economy. Schools mandate the same body of knowledge, which she sees as counterproductive to nurturing original thought and the ability to generate novel ideas.

## Suppression of Creativity and Rationality

One of the critical points raised by Fitzgerald is that the current schooling system suppresses children's creativity and rationalityâ€”[[rationality_and_creativity_in_children | traits that are inherently present from birth]]. Rather than nurturing these abilities, schools, through coercion and a rigid curriculum, stifle them, resulting in children losing their curiosity as they progress through the system.

## The Myth of Educational Foundation

A common defense of mandatory schooling is the necessity of obtaining a foundational body of knowledge before one can engage in higher-level creative thinking. However, Fitzgerald challenges this idea, stating that children learn best autonomously and through their interests, not through coercive school systems that dictate when and how they should learn basic skills.

## Conclusion

Fitzgerald's criticism of the mandatory schooling system is rooted in her broader philosophy of taking children seriously and recognizing them as rational, creative beings from birth. Her arguments suggest that by reevaluating how we educate children, moving towards a [[noncoercive_education_philosophy | non-coercive model]], society could unlock significant human potential that is currently being stifled by an antiquated educational approach.

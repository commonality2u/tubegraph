In a wide-ranging discussion with Patrick Collison, CEO of Stripe, the topic of deep technical knowledge and its relevance in today's ever-evolving career landscape came to the forefront. Collison emphasizes the importance of cultivating expertise and its enduring value across various disciplines.

## Accumulating Expertise Over Time

Patrick Collison highlighted the career of Herb Boyer, co-founder of Genentech, as an exemplar of the critical need for deep technical expertise in producing groundbreaking work. Boyer, in collaboration with Bob Swanson, made significant advances in biotechnology, such as the production of cheap insulin using recombinant DNA technology. Collison pointed out that such achievements were not the result of impulsive innovation typically celebrated in places like [[san_francisco_as_a_cultural_and_career_destination | San Francisco]], but rather through decades of rigorous study and skill development, emphasizing that Boyer's accomplishments couldn't have happened in his twenties, without accumulating substantial knowledge over the years ([00:03:35]).

## The Cultural Contrast: San Francisco's Iconoclasm

Collison observed that while San Francisco symbolizes dynamic innovation and entrepreneurship, it sometimes undervalues the pursuit of deep technical understanding. The city is often seen as a cultural metonym for iconoclastic ventures and entrepreneurial achievements, yet according to Collison, it may not always provide the necessary nurturing environment for cultivating profound technical expertise in certain domains. He remarks, "San Francisco valorizes striking out on your own... it doesn't encourage the pursuit of really deep technical knowledge" ([00:02:11]).

## The Path to Fulfillment and Global Impact

Collison argues that pursuing a path focused on deep technical knowledge can lead to both personal fulfillment and significant global contributions. He underscores that while the entrepreneurial success stories of figures like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates are noteworthy, the world still has room and necessity for other types of impactful contributions that come from a deeply knowledgeable base ([00:02:49]).

## Long-Term Career Trajectories vs. Immediate Success

In reflecting on advice for individuals in their twenties, Collison proposes considering paths that allow for the accumulation of expertise over time. He believes that many significant global innovations require decades if not lifetimes of dedicated study and mastery. Collison's advice is not prescriptive but rather an invitation to recognize and appreciate the value of deep knowledge, advising people to "get some ideas for domains, you're interested in, but then figure out where you can learn the highest standards" [[advice_for_people_in_their_20s]] ([00:12:46]).

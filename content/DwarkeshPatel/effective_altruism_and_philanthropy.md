Effective Altruism (EA) is a philosophy and social movement that emphasizes using evidence and reasoning to determine the most effective ways to benefit others. The goal of EA is to do the most good with limited resources, which aligns closely with certain philanthropic efforts.

## What is Effective Altruism?
Effective Altruism is centered around the principle of maximizing the good one can achieve, given the resources available. The movement encourages individuals to carefully consider where their time, money, and efforts can have the most significant impact.

### The Role of Effective Altruism in Philanthropy
Effective Altruism has a significant influence on how some philanthropic organizations operate. Organizations like GiveWell and [[open_source_software_management_and_maintenance | Open Philanthropy]] prioritize interventions that can verifiably improve as many lives as possible with the funds they allocate.

### GiveWell and Open Philanthropy's Impact
GiveWell, co-founded by Holden Karnofsky, is an organization that informs donors about where their money can do the most good. [[the_role_of_open_source_in_ai_development | Open Philanthropy]], another venture initiated by Karnofsky with support from Cari Tuna and Dustin Moskovitz, aims to allocate philanthropic funds where they can have the highest impact. As noted by Holden Karnofsky:

> "I've spent my career looking for ways to do as much good as possible with a dollar, an hour, or basically whatever resources you have (especially with money)." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>

### Examples of Effective Altruistic Philanthropy
One of the primary focuses for organizations guided by Effective Altruism is addressing global health and poverty through initiatives that can be empirically measured and proven to deliver results. For instance:

- Distribution of bed nets to prevent malaria.
- Providing medication for intestinal parasites.

## Interface with Advanced Technology and Global Development
Holden Karnofsky explains that considering potential future advances, particularly transformative AI, which could either vastly improve or detract from human well-being, is a major component of EA-aligned philanthropy:

> "If we are on the cusp of this century of creating these advanced AI systems, then we could be looking at a future that's either very good or very bad." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>

This aspect of EA adds a future-focused dimension to philanthropy, which involves preparing for and guiding technological transformations to ensure beneficial outcomes for humanity. The implications of such advanced systems resonate with discussions on [[ai_alignment_challenges_and_strategies | AI alignment challenges]] and the [[alignment_and_misalignment_of_ai | alignment and misalignment of AI]].

## Balancing Immediate and Long-Term Impact
One aspect of EA that makes it stand out in philanthropy is its balance between addressing immediate problems and considering far-off, high-stakes scenarios. While real-world interventions (like those funded by Open Philanthropy) focus on direct applications, such as healthcare aid in developing countries, there is also a significant emphasis on speculative future risks and opportunities, particularly those related to AI.

> "The more likely you think transformative AI is, the more you should think that that should be the top priority, that we should be trying to make that go well instead of trying to solve more direct problems that are more short term." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>

## Conclusion
Effective Altruism offers a strategic framework for philanthropy that combines rigorous analysis and a commitment to evidence-based interventions. It challenges donors and charitable institutions to question the efficacy and efficiency of their aid, urging them to aim for the greatest possible impact. This approach aligns with both immediate humanitarian aid and proactive preparation for future global challenges such as those faced in navigating [[potential_societal_impacts_of_advanced_ai | potential societal impacts of advanced AI]] and the [[challenges_in_ai_interpretability_and_alignment | challenges in AI interpretability and alignment]].

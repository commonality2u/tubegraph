The idea of the "success sequence" is a debated strategy for avoiding poverty, with its proponents arguing that by following a set of life milestones in a specific order, individuals can significantly reduce their chances of becoming impoverished. This concept was discussed in detail during a conversation with economist Bryan Caplan, who offers insights on its implications and critiques.

## Understanding the Success Sequence

The success sequence comprises three main steps:
1. **Completing a High School Diploma** - Graduating from high school is seen as an achievable step given the generally low standards in many American high schools. As Caplan highlights, simply showing up and trying is often enough to graduate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15">[05:15]</a>.
2. **Working Full-Time** - The ability to secure a full-time job is emphasized as critical in avoiding poverty, and according to Caplan, many individuals in poverty have noted that finding employment isn’t as difficult as it might seem outside of severe recessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21">[05:21]</a>.
3. **Getting Married Before Having Children** - This step emphasizes the importance of family planning, advocating for marriage before starting a family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56">[03:56]</a>.

## Why the Success Sequence Matters

Caplan argues that following these steps is straightforward and should be easily achievable for most people. However, there's a significant portion of the population that doesn't adhere to this sequence, often due to lack of impulse control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49">[07:49]</a>. Among the critiques, there's also the cultural argument that some communities may not emphasize or support these steps to the same extent as others, leading to variations in poverty rates across different demographics. This reflects the broader [[cultural_influence_on_productivity | cultural influences on economic productivity]].

## Critiques and Barriers

Critics of the success sequence often point to cultural and systemic barriers. For instance, Charles Murray’s perspective suggests that not all communities effectively promote these values, which might explain why individuals fail to follow them despite awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02">[10:02]</a>. Caplan, however, sees this as a weak excuse, arguing that personal responsibility should prevail despite the cultural narrative. This interaction of cultural influence with economic outcomes draws a parallel with the [[impact_of_historical_and_cultural_factors_on_development | impact of historical and cultural factors]] on development.

There is also a debate on whether this sequence is truly universally applicable. While Caplan defends its broader applicability, he acknowledges that following the sequence requires impulse control and foresight, which can be challenging for young individuals who may lack long-term planning skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00">[08:00]</a>.

## The Role of Impulse Control

Caplan notes that a primary barrier is poor impulse control, especially around sexual decisions that lead to having children before marriage. This lack of control can create long-term responsibilities that further complicate financial stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12">[09:12]</a>.

## Policy Considerations

To combat these issues, Caplan suggests policy measures that could reinforce the value of the success sequence through education and conditional welfare programs, potentially tying benefits to adherence to these milestones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58">[15:58]</a>. This approach aims to encourage responsibility and long-term planning among at-risk populations. Similar strategies are seen in AI governance, where early frameworks are considered to align [[ai_safety_and_security_measures | AI safety and security measures]] with societal goals.

## Conclusion

While the success sequence presents a clear pathway out of poverty for many, achieving its steps requires overcoming various personal, cultural, and systemic challenges. The debate continues over whether it’s a silver bullet or a simplistic solution that overshadows deeper socioeconomic issues. Nonetheless, understanding its components and the rationale behind them provides a foundation for discussions on poverty reduction strategies, echoing the complexities involved in strategic [[ai_alignment_and_ethical_implications | AI alignment and ethical planning]] for societal benefit.

Conquest's Second Law is a theory proposed by the British historian and writer, Robert Conquest, which suggests that "Any organization not explicitly right-wing sooner or later becomes left-wing." This concept has been a topic of significant debate and scrutiny among political scientists and historians.

## The Theory Explained

Conquest's Second Law posits that over time, institutions and organizations, unless they are explicitly conservative, will drift towards liberal or leftist ideologies. This drift is attributed to multiple factors, including the tendency for such organizations to prioritize inclusivity and diverse opinions, which often aligns with leftist values.

## Critiques and Counterarguments

- **Universality of the Law**: Tyler Cowen expressed skepticism about the universality of Conquest's Second Law. He argued that the law does not hold true in every context, pointing out instances where organizations did not follow this supposed inevitability. For example, Cowen mentions the World Bank, which was quite centrist-statist in the 1960s but became more neoliberal by the 1990s. Thus, the drift is not universally applicable, especially in global or complex setups [[impact_of_historical_and_cultural_factors_on_development | that are influenced by a wide range of historical factors]].

- **Definition of Ideological Shifts**: Cowen also noted the ambiguity in what constitutes "left-wing" and "right-wing," emphasizing that these terms are not universally applicable across historical contexts. He argues that categories of political ideology are often fluid and subject to reinterpretation over time. Thus, what is considered left or right can change depending on the temporal and cultural context [[influence_of_cultural_and_political_values_on_policy | driven by varying cultural and political values]].

- **Political Shifts**: Cowen suggested that shifts towards left-wing ideologies in certain contexts, like the American intelligentsia, are often driven by factors specific to political environments rather than an innate ideological drift. These factors can include realignment of political issues, educational polarization, and responses to actions by political parties [[historical_and_philosophical_influences_on_technology | influenced by broader historical and philosophical contexts]].

## Historical Contexts and Modern Interpretations

- **Historical Fluidity**: Cowen challenges the idea that left-wing and right-wing ideologies can be neatly categorized historically. He uses examples from medieval and early modern periods to show that political ideologies are often mixed and cannot be simply labeled in modern terms. This understanding complicates the application of Conquest's Law in historical analysis [[historical_international_relations | due to complex international relations and influences]].

- **Cultural and Contextual Variations**: Cowen emphasized the importance of local and contextual conditions in determining the ideological trajectories of institutions. He argued that institutions are influenced by complex cultural, educational, and political dynamics that can lead to varying ideological outcomes, not solely a leftward drift [[cultural_evolution_and_collective_brains | as seen in cultural evolution and the role of collective brains]].

## Conclusion

While Conquest's Second Law provides a provocative lens through which to view institutional evolution, Tyler Cowen and others highlight its limitations and challenge its applicability. The ideological journeys of organizations are subject to myriad influences, suggesting that a broader, more nuanced understanding of political change is necessary. Understanding these shifts requires considering contextual, cultural, and political factors that might either support or refute Conquest's observations.

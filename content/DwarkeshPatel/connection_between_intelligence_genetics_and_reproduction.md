In a recent discussion with Razib Khan, a prominent science blogger and geneticist, the intricate relationship between intelligence, genetics, and reproduction was explored. This article delves into the complexities of how these factors interplay, particularly in the context of genetic selection and evolutionary trends.

## Intelligence and Reproductive Trends

Razib Khan addressed the long-term equilibrium for intelligence under the assumption that no gene editing is introduced in the foreseeable future. He highlighted two potential avenues: one predicting the emergence of "fat tails" due to assortative mating, and the other forecasting a dysgenic trend due to lower fertility rates among more intelligent individuals. He noted, "People with genes for educational attainment tend to delay childbearing to the point where a lot of them do not have children," which underscores a current dysgenic trend due to delayed reproduction among the educated [[cultural_influence_on_fertility_rates | cultural influence on fertility rates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## The Genetic Underpinnings of Intelligence

The conversation further explored the genetic architecture of intelligence. Khan pointed out that intelligence is a polygenic trait influenced by numerous genetic loci, making it a challenging target for genetic editing in the short term. He mentioned that the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting intelligence is likely on the order of thousands, reflecting the complexity of the genetic basis of cognitive abilities [[artificial_intelligence_and_genomics | artificial intelligence and genomics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:44">[00:59:44]</a>.

## Selection Pressures and Cognitive Abilities

A key point in the discussion was the current selection pressures against certain cognitive traits due to societal choices and structures. "There is negative selection on genes for educational attainment," Khan stated, citing evidence from the developed world [[human_evolutionary_biology_and_anthropology | human evolutionary biology and anthropology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This is evident in societal trends where higher cognitive abilities are not necessarily linked with higher reproductive success due to lifestyle and career ambitions of individuals predisposed to high intelligence.

## Future of Intelligence Augmentation

Looking ahead, Khan speculated on the roles gene editing might play in augmenting human intelligence. He suggested that focusing on minimizing deleterious mutations could inadvertently enhance cognitive functions, rather than directly targeting intelligence through editing [[potential_future_advancements_in_gene_editing_and_artificial_intelligence | potential future advancements in gene editing and artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>. However, he projected that substantial advances in direct genetic enhancement of intelligence might be around 20 years away, given the current technological and ethical landscapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>.

## Societal Implications

The conversation concluded with a broader reflection on why society funds scientific research if it is not driven by a passion for truth. Khan underscored that without a genuine pursuit of knowledge, institutions could dissolve as priorities shift away from intellectual and scientific goals [[the_challenges_and_strategies_in_science_and_research_funding | the challenges and strategies in science and research funding]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>.

In summary, the intricate interplay between intelligence, genetics, and reproduction presents significant challenges and opportunities. Whether through natural selection processes or future genetic interventions, the balance of cognitive abilities and reproductive success remains a focal point for both scientific inquiry and societal evolution [[evolution_of_human_cognitive_abilities | evolution of human cognitive abilities]].

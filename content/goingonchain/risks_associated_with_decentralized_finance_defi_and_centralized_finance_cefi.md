In a volatile market with rising interest rates, ensuring assets work harder is crucial to cover expenses like mortgage interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Centralized Finance (CeFi) Risks

Many centralized finance (CeFi) platforms have faced significant issues, including exposure to events like the collapse of Terra or involvement with Three Arrows Capital (3AC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This has led to problems such as frozen withdrawals or platforms going bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Examples of platforms from which assets were withdrawn include Hodlnaut and Finblox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

While withdrawing assets from these services mitigates immediate risk, it also means the assets are not generating yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Platform Risk in CeFi
A significant risk in CeFi is "platform risk." If a centralized exchange or platform ceases operations or experiences a major issue, all assets held within that platform could be lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. For example, if FTX were to fail, any assets stored on it would be lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Understanding Yield Sources
It is important to understand where the yield on CeFi platforms comes from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Potential explanations for yield on platforms like FTX include:
*   Lending assets to the platform itself for margin and lending activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   Serving as a source of liquidity for lending and borrowing activities within the platform's ecosystem, such as FTX Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   The yield could also be part of marketing efforts to attract users to the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

Despite the potential for yield, it's explicitly stated that these methods are "not risk-free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### Earning Yield on CeFi Platforms
Despite the risks, centralized exchanges like KuCoin offer ways to earn yield:
*   **Crypto Lending:** Users can lend out crypto assets for interest with terms like seven or fourteen days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **KuCoin Earn:** This feature allows users to park stablecoins or Bitcoin to earn a certain Annual Percentage Rate (APR) with flexible or fixed tenures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
These services are generally available on most crypto exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

An example of earning yield on a CeFi platform is via the FTX app:
*   The FTX app interface is simpler than FTX Pro, focusing on buying, selling, depositing, and withdrawing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   Transfers of ERC20 tokens from FTX Pro to FTX App are free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   Deposits, such as USDC transferred from FTX Pro, are also free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   APY on FTX can be 6.1%, with the first $10,000 earning 8% and subsequent amounts earning 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   Withdrawal limits without KYC are $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   Withdrawal options include international wire transfers to foreign currency bank accounts or USDC transfers to crypto wallets like MetaMask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Withdrawals are typically free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Opportunities

An alternative to CeFi for earning yield is [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | DeFi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Liquid Staking:** Platforms like Lido or Rocket Pool allow users to stake Ethereum (ETH) and earn rewards, typically around 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Running Own Node:** Running one's own node and staking can yield higher ETH rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Safest Option: Self-Custody

The safest approach is to store crypto assets in a personal wallet and await price appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This adheres to the principle "your keys, your coin; not your keys, not your coin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Risk Management

To manage risks, a mixed approach combining different strategies is advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Prudent risk management involves diversification, ensuring some assets continue to earn yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

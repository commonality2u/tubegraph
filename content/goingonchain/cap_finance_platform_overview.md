CAP Finance is a decentralized exchange (DEX) designed for synthetic assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. It is described as a "degen low cap" yield protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Core Functionality
Currently, CAP Finance supports two trading pairs: ETH and BTC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Traders on the platform can utilize leverage up to a maximum of 50x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. A notable feature for traders is the absence of trading fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, with the aim to create a "flywheel" effect of more traders leading to more volume and increased liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

However, traders should note that there is no stop-loss feature, and liquidation occurs at 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Liquidity Provision and Yield Generation
CAP Finance ensures its liquidity by having traders execute trades against a central pool of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This pool is composed of ETH and USDC, acting as the counterparty to traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

The attractive yields offered on CAP Finance are derived from traders' losses, as the pool essentially functions as the "house" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. When a trader wins, they take profit from the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Conversely, when a trader loses, their asset goes into the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. If a trader is liquidated, a partial amount of their asset also flows into the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Notably, 100% of a losing position is transferred into the ETH and USDC liquidity pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Current Yields
As of the transcript's date, CAP Finance offered the following approximate yields:
*   69% on ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>
*   34% on USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   11.5% on staking the [[cap_finance_token_and_its_potential | CAP token]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>

### Risks of Pooling
[[risk_factors_in_cap_finance_pooling | Pooling on CAP Finance]] is not risk-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. If a large group of traders experiences significant wins, liquidity providers may not recover their initial deposits, as profits are drawn from the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The yield is dynamic, meaning it will decrease as more funds enter the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Withdrawal Policy
When withdrawing from the pools, a 1% fee applies to both the ETH and USDC pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Additionally, there is a 24-hour lock period during which funds cannot be withdrawn after being deposited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Tokenomics and Comparison
The [[cap_finance_token_and_its_potential | CAP token]] has a market capitalization of approximately 12.5 million USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The token currently offers no governance rights; its primary utility is for exposure to the protocol's potential growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

In the perpetual decentralized exchange space, leaders include GMX and Gains Network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, which have demonstrated strong performance based on trading volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. For comparison, GMX has a P/E ratio of roughly 14.5, while CAP Finance, based on current numbers, has a P/E ratio of approximately 9.87, considering total revenue shared with holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

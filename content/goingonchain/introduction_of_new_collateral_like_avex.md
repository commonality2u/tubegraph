To improve the sustainability of the Anchor protocol and address a gap where more people are depositing than borrowing, Anchor plans to add more [[collateral_management_for_borrowing_on_anchor | collateral]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The goal is to allow more people to borrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## AVAX as New Collateral
Recently, Anchor added AVAX as a collateral option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This allows users of AVAX to [[borrowing_ust_using_savax_on_the_avax_chain | borrow UST]] on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Challenges in Adding Collateral
Adding new collateral to the platform is a process that takes time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. It is not possible to add a large amount of new collateral quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

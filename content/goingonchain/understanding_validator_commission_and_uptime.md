If you are holding Luna, you can use it to earn more Luna and receive airdrops by staking it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This process involves delegating your Luna to validators on the Terra network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## [[choosing_validators_for_staking | Choosing Validators for Staking]]

To stake Luna, navigate to the "Staking" section in your Terra wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. You will find a list of validators, initially sorted by uptime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The list can also be sorted by commission or voting power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. There are typically around 105 validators available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

When [[choosing_validators_for_staking | choosing validators]], consider the following criteria:

### Voting Power
It is generally not recommended to stake with the top 5 validators to avoid concentrating too much power at the top of the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Self-Delegation
This metric indicates the amount of Luna a validator has delegated to themselves, demonstrating that they have "skin in the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. A higher self-delegation amount can be seen as a positive sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Commission
Commission refers to the percentage of your staking reward that the validator takes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Ideally, you should look for validators with a zero percent commission rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Uptime
Uptime indicates how consistently the validator's node is working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. It is crucial to choose validators with 100% uptime, as you will not earn rewards if your chosen validator is not actively participating in the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Staking Your Luna
Once you have selected a validator based on these criteria, you can click "Delegate," enter the amount of Luna you wish to stake, and confirm the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. After delegating, you can view a summary of your staked amount and the rewards you are accumulating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Earning Rewards and Airdrops
In addition to earning more Luna as staking rewards, delegating your Luna can also make you eligible for special airdrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

To check for and collect available airdrops:
1.  Visit `terrasmartstake.io` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
2.  Click the gear icon and input your Terra address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
3.  Scroll down to see if any unclaimed airdrops are available for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
4.  If eligible, click "Claim" to receive your airdrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

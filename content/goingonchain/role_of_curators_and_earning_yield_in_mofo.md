Mofo, a [[mofo_lending_and_borrowing_market_features | lending and borrowing market]], features an "Earn" section where users can provide liquidity and generate [[yield_optimization_and_decentralized_finance_defi | yield]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Earning Yield through Votes
In the "Earn" section, users provide liquidity into "votes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. All these votes are created and managed by curators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

For example, in the "seamless USDC vote by Gunlett," depositing USDC can earn a [[lessons_from_high_apy_yield_farming | yield]] of 6.09% [[lessons_from_high_apy_yield_farming | APY]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. A performance fee of 15% is accounted for in this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Role of Curators
Curators are responsible for managing the funds deposited into a vote, such as USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Their role involves actively allocating and managing the capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. They provide active management for users and charge a fee for their services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

The liquidity provided by users in these votes is then allocated by curators into various [[isolated_markets_benefits_in_mofo | isolated]] markets created within Mofo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. For instance, 77% of the USDC in the "seamless USDC vote" is allocated to the CBUSDC market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The USDC that is borrowed in these markets originates from these votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

The Total Value Locked (TVL) of a curator is a combination of MOO and UL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>, representing the capital they have accumulated and manage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

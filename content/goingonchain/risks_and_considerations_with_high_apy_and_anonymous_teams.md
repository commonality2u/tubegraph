Investing in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) projects, particularly those offering exceptionally high Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) and managed by anonymous teams, carries significant [[Risks and considerations in DeFi investments | risks]]. These types of projects often fall under the category of "degen plays," characterized by high potential returns but also high potential for loss.

## Case Study: Snow Dog DAO

Snow Dog DAO serves as an illustrative example of such a project. It was shared within a Telegram group due to its "degen" nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

### Initial Characteristics and Warnings
Upon initial review, Snow Dog DAO displayed an "insane" APY, reminiscent of Snowbank's early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Key concerns identified immediately included:
*   **Anonymous Team:** The developers behind Snow Dog DAO were anonymous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   **Unsustainable APY:** The extremely high APY was deemed unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **Potential for Ragpull:** The anonymous nature of the team raised concerns about a possible "ragpull" (scam) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

### Project Mechanism and Duration
Snow Dog DAO utilized an Olympus fork method to raise capital for a memecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The project was designed to last for a fixed period of 8 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>:
*   **Days 1-5:** Users could "mint" S-Dog tokens. The total supply of S-Dog would increase during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Minting had a 3-day vesting period, shorter than the 5-day period seen in projects like Wonderland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Day 5 Onwards:** Minting stopped, but users could still redeem previously minted tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Day 8 (The "Big Day"):** The price was expected to be highly volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. All assets, excluding the liquidity pool, would be swapped for MIM (Magic Internet Money), a stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This MIM would then be used to buy S-Dog from the S-Dog/MIM liquidity pool, and the S-Dog bought would be burnt, reducing supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Staking rewards would pause, S-Dog would have a fixed supply, and it would transition into a memecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Associated [[Risks and considerations in DeFi investments | Risks]]
The project carries several inherent [[Risks and considerations in DeFi investments | risks]]:
*   **Anonymous Development Team:** The same anonymous team behind Snowbank also released Snow Dog DAO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This anonymity always presents a potential for a "ragpull," where developers disappear with investor funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. While Snowbank continued to operate, the risk remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Unsustainable Yields:** High APYs are often short-lived and unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **Short Project Lifespan:** The 8-day duration means investors must act quickly, and the project's utility and value change dramatically at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **High Volatility and Price Swings:** The price of Snow Dog DAO saw significant appreciation quickly, with a peak around $6,000 within less than a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Such rapid gains are often followed by equally rapid losses. The host stated that by the time the video was watched, it would likely be considered "late" to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Transition to a Memecoin:** After day 8, the token's purpose shifts from a high-yield asset to a memecoin, which relies heavily on community sentiment and speculative trading for its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Strategies for "Degen" Play
For those still considering participation in such high-[[Supply APY vs Stake APR | APY]], short-term projects, certain strategies are employed:
1.  **Minting with Highest Discount:** Focus on minting from liquidity pools that offer the largest discount, such as the S-Dog/MIM LP pool, where tokens could be minted at $2,000 when the market price was $5,400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
2.  **Claim and Sell/Auto-Stake:** After vesting (e.g., 3 days), investors can choose to:
    *   Claim and sell tokens at market price if the price is favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
    *   Claim and auto-stake to take advantage of the high APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
An example strategy involves redeeming and selling every few hours to try and recover initial capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Key Takeaways for [[Managing risk with crypto investments | Managing Risk]]
*   **Fast In, Fast Out:** Projects of this nature often require investors to be quick to enter and exit the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **New and Non-Standard:** These are not typical, established DeFi projects, and their mechanisms can differ significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **High Risk, High Reward:** Acknowledge that this is a "degen play" with a high level of [[Risks and considerations in DeFi investments | risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Not Financial Advice:** Always conduct personal research before investing in such ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

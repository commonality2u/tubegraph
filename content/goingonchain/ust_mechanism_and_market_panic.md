The [[2022_crypto_market_downturn_and_key_events|Luna downfall]] was a result of several contributing factors, leading to widespread market panic and significant financial losses for many, including the speaker, whose position was liquidated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Despite the setback, a belief in the crypto space persists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Factors Contributing to the Luna Downfall

### Coordinated Attack
A primary factor identified was a coordinated attack on UST (TerraUSD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Attackers reportedly acquired one billion UST and loaned it for three billion BTC before selling it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This action triggered a "bank run" on [[anchors_impact_of_market_sentiment|Anchor]] Protocol, as the de-peg of UST caused widespread worry and led people to sell their holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Terra's UST-Luna Mechanism
The inherent mechanism of Terra's UST played a critical role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. When UST is sold, it results in the minting of Luna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Consequently, increased selling of UST leads to a greater supply of Luna, initiating a "dead loop" or "vicious cycle" where Luna's price continuously declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### LFG's Bitcoin Reserves
The Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) attempted to stabilize UST by using its Bitcoin (BTC) reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. However, their continuous selling of BTC to maintain UST's peg caused a broader panic in the entire crypto market, further exacerbating the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Macroeconomic and Regulatory Pressures
The crisis unfolded amidst challenging macroeconomic conditions, including persistent high inflation and negative economic data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Additionally, comments from the Treasury Secretary specifically addressing UST and calling for stablecoin regulation intensified market jitters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Current Market State and Outlook

As a result of these factors, UST lost its peg, and Luna's price plummeted to less than 10 cents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Terra's stated priority, according to their latest tweets, is to restore the UST peg, even if it means further decreasing Luna's price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This strategy involves continued burning of UST, which mints more Luna, thereby driving Luna's price down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

Beyond Terra, the market experienced broader distress; BTC continued its downward trend due to large sell-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, and even USDT (Tether), another major stablecoin, temporarily lost its peg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The period was described as "very tough" and "very painful" for those involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

[[Partnership with Spirit Swap | Spiritswap]] V2 introduces significant enhancements to its platform, aiming to provide a more seamless and user-friendly experience, particularly concerning bridging and swapping assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. These improvements are part of the broader [[spiritswap_v2_features_and_improvements | Spiritswap V2 features and improvements]], moving beyond just [[user_interface_changes_in_spiritswap_v2 | user interface changes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Revamped Bridge Functionality

The bridge functionality in Spiritswap V2 has undergone a complete overhaul compared to its predecessor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### V1 Bridging Process

In Spiritswap V1, transferring assets, for example, from the Ethereum mainnet to the Fantom chain to acquire SpiritSwap tokens, required a two-step process:
1.  **Bridge Assets**: Users first had to bridge their assets from the mainnet to the Fantom chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
2.  **Execute Swap**: After bridging, a separate swap transaction was needed to convert the bridged assets into SpiritSwap tokens or other desired tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### V2 Integrated Swap-While-Bridging

Spiritswap V2 streamlines this process significantly. Users can now perform a swap concurrently with the bridging action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This means that when assets are moved from a chain like Ethereum to the Fantom chain, users can directly receive SpiritSwap tokens or any other available Fantom chain tokens in a single transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Customizable Bridge Modes

V2 also introduces flexibility in the bridging process by allowing users to select a preferred bridge mode based on their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>:
*   **Cheapest Mode**: This option takes more time to complete but aims to secure the best possible rate for the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Fastest Mode**: While this mode executes the transaction in the shortest possible time, users might not receive the absolute best rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

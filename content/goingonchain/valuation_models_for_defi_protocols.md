Valuation models in decentralized finance (DeFi) are crucial for assessing the financial health and potential of various protocols. A relatively new concept in the DeFi space, known as [[real_yield_in_defi | Real Yield]], has significantly influenced how these protocols are evaluated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Understanding Real Yield

In contrast to older yield farming days, which often featured over 10,000% APRs driven by inflationary platform tokens, [[real_yield_in_defi | Real Yield]] provides rewards in a different format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. With [[real_yield_in_defi | Real Yield]], when users interact with a protocol, token holders receive a portion of the generated revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. These rewards are typically distributed in mainstream assets like Ethereum (ETH) or stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

Examples of protocols employing [[real_yield_in_defi | Real Yield]] include:
*   **GMX**: Staking GMX tokens earns both GMX and ETH rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **GNS**: Stakers earn 4% in DAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **Umami**: Depositing assets earns ETH rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Kujira**: Staking Kujira tokens collects rewards in various asset types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Common Valuation Approaches

Most valuation models seen on platforms like Twitter involve comparing various metrics to understand how protocols generate revenue and fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

The typical process involves:
1.  **Volume Analysis**: Calculating the volume of activity on the protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
2.  **Fee Generation**: Determining the amount of fees generated from that volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
3.  **Ratio Calculation**: Running ratios to estimate the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
4.  **Undervaluation Assessment**: Using the P/E ratio to assess whether the platform is undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## [[tools_for_analyzing_defi_protocols | Tools for Analyzing DeFi Protocols]]

Several [[tools_for_analyzing_defi_protocols | tools_for_analyzing_defi_protocols]] can assist in gathering the necessary data for these valuations:
*   **Token Terminal**: A platform for tracking DeFi metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Dune Analytics**: Features highly informative dashboards created by community contributors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Protocol Statistic Pages**: Many protocols host their own dedicated statistics pages with relevant data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Important Considerations for Valuation

When performing valuations, several factors can significantly impact the results, falling under the broader topic of [[impact_of_supply_and_expenses_on_valuation_models | impact_of_supply_and_expenses_on_valuation_models]]:

*   **Supply Figure**: The choice between using circulating supply versus total supply can lead to vastly different valuation results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Expenses**: Token emissions, often used to incentivize and attract users, should be considered as expenses within the model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Chain Migration**: The impact of a protocol moving to a new blockchain (e.g., dydx migrating to Cosmos from Ethereum's security) needs to be factored in. Such a move can affect user retention due to changes in security paradigms, wallet requirements, and interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

Ultimately, there is no single "right" or "wrong" valuation model; the optimal approach depends on how one chooses to construct it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The goal is to utilize these [[tools_for_analyzing_defi_protocols | tools_for_analyzing_defi_protocols]] and considerations to inform better decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Bitcoin, a prominent [[introduction_to_cryptocurrency | cryptocurrency]], is not backed by any physical assets or any government body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This characteristic distinguishes it from traditional financial instruments like US Treasury bonds or gold, which typically have governmental or physical backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Due to this lack of backing, Bitcoin theoretically has the potential to lose all its value and go to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

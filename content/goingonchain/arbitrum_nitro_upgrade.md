The Arbitrum Nitro upgrade was introduced as a solution to address network congestion issues on the Arbitrum blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Background for Implementation
Prior to the Nitro upgrade, Arbitrum experienced significant traffic, particularly during the [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This surge in activity, largely driven by [[speculations_about_an_arbitrum_airdrop | speculation about an Arbitrum airdrop]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, led to a spike in gas prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. As a result, the [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey program]] was halted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

The purpose of Nitro was to upgrade the chain to allow for more traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Launch and Aftermath
Arbitrum Nitro officially went live on August 31st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Despite the upgrade, the [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey program]] did not resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

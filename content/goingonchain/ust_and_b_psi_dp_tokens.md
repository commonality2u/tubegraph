An arbitrage opportunity currently exists on the Terra network, specifically involving the Nexus Protocol's liquid pylon pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This opportunity revolves around the [[steps_and_requirements_for_transferring_ust | UST]] stablecoin and a unique receipt token called B PSI DP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Liquid Pylon Pool Mechanics

The Nexus Protocol offers a liquid pylon pool where users can deposit [[steps_and_requirements_for_transferring_ust | UST]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This deposit locks the [[steps_and_requirements_for_transferring_ust | UST]] for a duration of 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. During this 24-month period, participants earn Nexus tokens as a reward, with the current Annual Percentage Rate (APR) being approximately 15.73% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The pool behaves like a bond; for example, a deposit of $1,000 [[steps_and_requirements_for_transferring_ust | UST]] will yield the original $1,000 back plus accumulated rewards after 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

The distinguishing feature of the liquid pylon pool, compared to a regular pylon pool, is the issuance of a receipt token known as B PSI DP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This token represents the user's deposit and can be swapped for [[steps_and_requirements_for_transferring_ust | UST]] on TerraSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## The B PSI DP De-peg and Arbitrage Opportunity

Currently, the B PSI DP token is experiencing a de-peg from its expected value against [[steps_and_requirements_for_transferring_ust | UST]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This means that one can acquire B PSI DP tokens at a discounted rate relative to the [[steps_and_requirements_for_transferring_ust | UST]] amount they represent in the pylon pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

For instance, an individual was able to use $100 of [[steps_and_requirements_for_transferring_ust | UST]] to obtain $128 of B PSI DP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Pylon's records subsequently showed a deposit of $128.973 [[steps_and_requirements_for_transferring_ust | UST]] for an actual payment of only $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This represents a de-peg of approximately 28% to 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

To capitalize on this situation, one needs to be bullish on the Nexus token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>:

1.  **Wait for De-peg Resolution:** The primary strategy is to acquire B PSI DP at the discounted rate and then wait for the de-peg to resolve, allowing the B PSI DP value to return closer to the [[steps_and_requirements_for_transferring_ust | UST]] amount it represents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
2.  **Long-Term Hold with Nexus Rewards:** In a worst-case scenario where the de-peg persists, holding the B PSI DP token for the full 24-month duration of the pool will still result in receiving the original deposited [[steps_and_requirements_for_transferring_ust | UST]] amount (e.g., $128 in the example, despite only paying $100) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Crucially, during this 24-month waiting period, the user continues to earn Nexus tokens as a reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Considerations

While this presents an interesting arbitrage opportunity, it's important to note that 24 months is considered a very long wait in the volatile cryptocurrency market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. The de-peg might be a result of the current bearish market conditions, leading individuals to sell their B PSI DP and creating this discrepancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

Cap Finance is a [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | decentralized exchange]] (DEX) focused on synthetic assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Currently, it supports trading for ETH and BTC pairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Users can leverage up to 50x on Cap Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

Cap Finance operates by having traders trade against a liquidity pool composed of ETH and USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. When a trader wins, they take profit from the pool; when they lose, the assets go into the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. If a trader is liquidated, 100% of their lost position goes into the ETH and USDC pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Key Differentiators

Cap Finance aims to differentiate itself by having no trading fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The protocol's goal is to create a "flywheel" effect: attracting more traders through zero fees, which in turn leads to more trading volume and increased liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

For traders using Cap Finance:
*   There are no fees for trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   There is no stop-loss feature available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   Liquidation occurs at 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

For liquidity providers ("the house market maker"):
*   Attractive yields are generated from traders' losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   Pooling is not risk-free; a large win by a group of traders could lead to loss of deposited funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   Withdrawals incur a 1% fee for both ETH and USDC pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   There is a 24-hour lock period on deposits, during which funds cannot be withdrawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   Yields are dynamic and will decrease as more funds enter the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Comparison with Other Perpetual DEXs

Leaders in the perpetual [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | decentralized exchange]] space include GMX and Gains, which are described as earlier protocols doing very well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Financial Metrics

*   Cap Finance has a market capitalization of approximately $12.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   GMX has a Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of roughly 14.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   Cap Finance has a P/E ratio of around 9.87, based on current numbers considering total revenue shares to holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
    *   *Users can verify these numbers on Token Terminal for reference* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### Token Governance

The Cap token currently does not have governance features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Therefore, buying the token is primarily for exposure to the protocol rather than participation in its governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

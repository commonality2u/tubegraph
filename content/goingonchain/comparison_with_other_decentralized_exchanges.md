The protocol operates by having traders trade against a liquidity pool composed of ETH and USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Leaders in Perpetual Decentralized Exchanges

In the space of perpetual [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges|decentralized exchanges]], GMX and Gains are identified as earlier leaders that are performing well, evidenced by their trading volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Cap Finance's Differentiation

Cap Finance aims to differentiate itself from competitors like GMX and Gains primarily through its fee structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>:

*   **No Trading Fees** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>: Cap Finance's goal is to create a "flywheel" effect where the absence of fees attracts more traders, leading to increased volume and, consequently, more liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This no-fee model is considered attractive for DeFi users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Market Cap**: Cap Finance currently has a market capitalization of approximately $12.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Token Governance**: As of now, holding Cap Finance tokens does not grant governance rights within the protocol. The token is primarily for exposure to the protocol's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

### P/E Ratio Comparison

When comparing valuation metrics, GMX has a Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of approximately 14.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. In contrast, Cap Finance, based on current numbers and considering total revenue shares to holders, has a P/E ratio of about 9.87 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Users interested in verifying these numbers can use platforms like Token Terminal for reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

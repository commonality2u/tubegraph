[[overview_and_introduction_of_astroport_as_a_next_generation_amm_on_terra | Astroport]] is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) designed for the Terra ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Its [[tokenomics_and_team_structure | tokenomics]] include specific allocations for various participants and a novel distribution mechanism.

## Token Breakdown and Allocation

The token distribution for [[overview_and_introduction_of_astroport_as_a_next_generation_amm_on_terra | Astroport]] is structured as follows:
*   **Liquidity Pool (LP) Providers**: 55% of tokens are allocated to liquidity pool providers over a period of four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.
*   **Team and Investors**: 30% of the tokens are distributed to the team and investors over three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

## Subtokens

In addition to the main [[tokenomics_and_team_structure | Astroport token]], there are two other sub-tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

## Initial Token Distribution ([[launch_details_and_token_drop_phases_for_astroport | Token Drop Phases]])

[[launch_details_and_token_drop_phases_for_astroport | Astroport]] will not have an Initial DEX Offering (IDO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>, but instead will utilize a [[launch_details_and_token_drop_phases_for_astroport | token drop]] mechanism divided into three phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>:

1.  **DeFi Participation Airdrop**: Users who participate in Terra's Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem may receive an airdrop of tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. While specific details were not provided, it is suggested that farming activities on Terra could qualify users for some tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
2.  **[[comparisons_between_astroport_and_other_amms_like_terraswap_and_uniswap | Terraswap]] Liquidity Migration**: Users providing liquidity on [[comparisons_between_astroport_and_other_amms_like_terraswap_and_uniswap | Terraswap]] are invited to migrate their liquidity to [[overview_and_introduction_of_astroport_as_a_next_generation_amm_on_terra | Astroport]] and will receive tokens for doing so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
3.  **Astroport UST Pool Commitment**: Tokens earned from the first two phases can be committed into the [[overview_and_introduction_of_astroport_as_a_next_generation_amm_on_terra | Astroport]] UST pool to earn even more tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

Phases two and three involve a lockup period, which users can choose within the user interface, similar to Pylon Protocol's vesting periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

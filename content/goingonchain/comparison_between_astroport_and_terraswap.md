Astroport is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) designed for the [[overview_of_astroport_as_an_amm_on_terra | Terra]] blockchain, aiming to provide a comprehensive and decentralized exchange experience that improves upon existing solutions like Terraswap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Why Terra Needs Another AMM

Despite Terraswap's presence, the Terra ecosystem requires a more advanced AMM due to several limitations of Terraswap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>:

*   **Limited Purpose**
    Terraswap was initially built to support the Mirror Protocol and was not intended to be a "full-patch AMM" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. It offers very basic functionality, lacking features like chart trends or Annual Percentage Yield (APY) displays found in more comprehensive AMMs like SpiritSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Single Pool Type Limitation**
    Traditional AMMs, including Terraswap, typically use only one type of product pool: the "constant product" formula, popularized by Uniswap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. While effective for highly volatile pairs like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), this formula results in poor slippage for stablecoin pools or newly launched tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   **Loss of Native Protocol Benefits**
    When users provide liquidity on Terraswap, they may lose out on benefits that would otherwise be earned by providing liquidity directly on the native protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. For example, providing ANC/UST liquidity on Terraswap means missing out on Anchor Protocol benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## How Astroport Addresses Terraswap's Limitations

Astroport aims to resolve these issues by offering a more robust and user-centric platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>:

*   **Enhanced User Interface and Experience (UI/UX)**
    Astroport promises a better UI/UX, providing chart trends and a more user-friendly interface compared to Terraswap's basic swap screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Multiple Product Pool Types**
    Unlike Terraswap's single constant product pool, Astroport will feature three different types of pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This diversity is intended to optimize exchange rates and reduce slippage for various asset types, benefiting users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **[[innovative_features_of_astroport_like_astro_generators | Astro Generators]] for Double Farming**
    A significant innovation is the [[innovative_features_of_astroport_like_astro_generators | Astro Generators]] feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This allows users to provide liquidity, for instance, ANC/UST, to Astroport's generators. These generators act as a proxy smart contract, tying the liquidity back to the native protocol (e.g., Anchor), enabling users to earn both the Astroport token and the native protocol's benefits simultaneously â€“ a concept known as "double farming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Experienced Team**
    Astroport is developed by "Astropod Joint Ventures," comprising individuals from prominent groups such as Delphi Digital, IDO, and Terraform Labs (TFL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Launch and Token Distribution

Astroport was undergoing auditing and was expected to launch around mid-November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. It will not have an Initial DEX Offering (IDO) but will instead utilize a token drop strategy across three phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>:

1.  **DeFi Participation**: Users who have participated in Terra's DeFi ecosystem (e.g., farming) will receive a token allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
2.  **Terraswap Liquidity Provider Migration**: Terraswap LPs are encouraged to migrate their liquidity to Astroport and will receive tokens for doing so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
3.  **Astroport UST Pool Commitment**: Tokens earned from the first two phases can be committed to the Astroport UST pool to earn even more tokens. Phases two and three involve a lockup period, similar to Pylon Protocol's vesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

The year 2022 saw significant challenges in the crypto space, marked by market downturns, scams, and fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Despite the volatility, staying in the space demonstrates a strong belief in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. These events provided key lessons for managing crypto assets securely.

## Key Learnings for Secure Management

### Understanding Yields and Risks

A crucial lesson learned is: "If I do not understand the yield, where the yield is coming from, I am the yield" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. During bull markets, understanding where yields originated seemed easier, but the speaker experienced significant losses with Wonderland and Terra Luna, highlighting the risks associated with certain [[strategies_for_earning_interest_on_crypto_assets | yield-earning strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Utilizing Data for Informed Decisions

To make more informed decisions, it is beneficial to acquire skills like Python and SQL to extract and better understand on-chain data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. While following thought leaders is one approach, examining their on-chain actions provides a different perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Tools like Nansen can be leveraged to make better informed decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### The Importance of Self-Custody: "Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins"

One of the most vital takeaways for [[security_of_crypto_assets | securing crypto assets]] is the principle "not your keys, not your coins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Incidents involving platforms like Celsius and FTX underscore the critical importance of self-custody for your assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

> [!WARNING]
> The collapse of platforms like Celsius and FTX highlights the risks of entrusting large sums of crypto assets to intermediaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This emphasizes the importance of [[role_of_intermediaries_in_crypto_funds_management | avoiding reliance on intermediaries]] for long-term storage.

### Practical Approach to Centralized Exchanges (CEXs)

While self-custody is paramount, Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) still serve a purpose, particularly for on-ramping and off-ramping fiat currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. However, it is advisable not to keep large sums of assets on CEXs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. A recommended strategy is to use platforms like Binance or Crypto.com for transactions, then swiftly move the assets to a personal wallet once acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This directly relates to [[security_features_of_crypto_wallets | managing assets securely in your own wallet]].

### The Role of Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

The growing concern regarding trust with Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) strengthens the case for Decentralized Finance (DeFi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. DeFi platforms often enable users to maintain self-custody, aligning with the "not your keys, not your coins" principle and potentially offering a more secure alternative for asset management.

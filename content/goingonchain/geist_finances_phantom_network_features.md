Geist Finance is a decentralized, non-custodial money market protocol operating on the [[overview_of_cap_finance_protocol | Phantom Network]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>. Launched on October 6th, it quickly accumulated approximately 3 billion Total Value Locked (TVL) in a single day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. The platform functions similarly to Aave, allowing users to lend and borrow money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

## Core Principles and Features

Geist Finance aims to differentiate itself by having no governance and no Venture Capital (VC) funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. All revenue generated by the platform is directed back to its token holders and liquidity providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

### Earning Opportunities
Users can earn in several ways:
*   **Lending and Borrowing:** By supplying assets, users earn an Annual Percentage Rate (APR) in GUYS tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. Borrowing assets like FTM also yields rewards in GUYS tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
*   **Liquidity Provision:** Providing liquidity for the GUYS-FTM pair also earns GUYS token rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   **Airdrops:** Users who supply on Curve may also receive airdrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

### Reward System and Penalties
To maintain ecosystem stability and discourage immediate selling of rewards, Geist Finance implements a penalty system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>:
*   **Holding Period:** Users must hold their rewards for at least 90 days to avoid a 50% deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.
*   **Staking vs. Locking:**
    *   **Staking:** Allows users to exit anytime but incurs a 50% penalty on rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. Stakers earn anonymous platform fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.
    *   **Locking:** Requires a strict 3-month lock-up period, with no early exit option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. Locked GUYS earn platform fees and "supernative" fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. Platform fees can be earned in various tokens like DAI, GUYS, Ethereum, FTM, and USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>.

## Security and Transparency
Despite having an anonymous team, Geist Finance has implemented a multisig (multi-signature) system to enhance security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. Any changes to the protocol's code require three out of five high-profile signers to approve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. These signers include individuals from File Foundation, SpookySwap, and DeFi Llama, who are well-known in the Phantom and DeFi industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. Additionally, a two-day time lock is in place for all code changes, providing transparency and a buffer against sudden malicious actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. The team is also noted for being very transparent in their Telegram group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

## User Experience and Market Dynamics
Upon its launch, Geist Finance offered extremely high APY rates, reaching up to 10,000% for liquidity pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. While such high APYs initially attract capital, they tend to decrease as more participants join the farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.

### Risks in Liquidity Provision
Participating in liquidity pools involving volatile assets, such as the GUYS-FTM pair, carries significant risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>. A "triple hit" scenario can occur where the price of the farming token (GUYS), the price of the paired asset (FTM), and the APY all decline simultaneously, leading to substantial losses in the liquidity pool's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>.

### Capital Mobility
The DeFi space experiences rapid capital movement, with funds quickly shifting between networks and protocols in pursuit of higher yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>. This can be observed as capital rapidly migrated from platforms like Geist Finance on Phantom to new liquidity mining programs on the Harmony network, such as DeFi Kingdom, Sushi, and Curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>.

### Stablecoin Farming
For those with substantial capital (e.g., $20,000-$30,000), farming with stablecoins (e.g., USDT, DAI, USDC) on Geist Finance can be a more stable approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>. This method removes exposure to asset price volatility, as stablecoins are pegged to one dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. While slower, it offers a more comfortable way to earn passive income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>.

Despite these challenges, Geist Finance maintains its position as the second-highest protocol in terms of TVL on the [[overview_of_cap_finance_protocol | Phantom Network]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:32:00">[19:32:00]</a>.

The year 2022 was described as "down back" for the crypto market, with the popular index falling significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. This period was marked by a series of events that underscored the critical [[importance_of_cryptocurrency_security | importance of digital security]] and robust asset management in the cryptocurrency space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

## Key Market Events Highlighting Risk

Several major incidents contributed to market pain and served as lessons for participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>:
*   **Wonderland Rock (Rug Pull)**: January to February saw the Wonderland Rock incident, which significantly impacted some investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. This event led to losses for those "sucked into this frog nation narrative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.
*   **Federal Reserve Interest Rate Hikes**: Starting in March, the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates, leading to a halt in "money printers," a withdrawal of "risk Capital," and the onset of a "liquidity crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.
*   **Fall of Luna**: May witnessed the "big one" with the collapse of Luna, which had a widespread impact and started a "chain reaction" like a "House of Cards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.
*   **Centralized Exchange Failures**: June brought further turmoil with Celsius halting withdrawals, followed by the liquidation of 3AC, and later, the high-profile FTX Chapter 11 filing involving SPF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.
*   **Prevalence of Scams**: Beyond these major events, 2022 also saw a significant increase in "scam and fraud" activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

## Lessons Learned for Asset Management

Through these challenges, several key takeaways emerged regarding [[managing_risk_with_crypto_investments | managing risk with crypto investments]] and [[importance_of_storing_crypto_assets_safely | storing crypto assets safely]]:

### Understanding Yield and Due Diligence
A crucial lesson is to understand the source of yield in investments; if one doesn't comprehend where the yield originates, they might become the yield for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:09">[01:39:09]</a>. While the bull market made [[investing_in_cryptocurrency | investing in cryptocurrency]] seem easier, events like Wonderland and Terra Luna demonstrated the dangers of misunderstanding underlying mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. To make more informed decisions, it is beneficial to acquire skills such as Python and SQL to extract and analyze on-chain data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:06">[01:54:06]</a>. Observing thought leaders' on-chain actions through tools like Nansen can provide valuable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

### Self-Custody of Assets
The principle "not your keys, not your coins" is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. Cases like Celsius and FTX strongly emphasize the [[security_measures_for_cryptocurrency_wallets | importance of self-custody]] for assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. While centralized exchanges (CEXs) are still used for "on/off-ramp" functionalities (e.g., Binance, Crypto.com), large sums of assets should not be kept on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. Instead, assets should be quickly moved from CEXs to personal wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. The prevailing concern regarding trust in CEXs further bolsters the case for decentralized finance (DeFi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

### Managing Digital Footprint
Beyond asset management, it's also crucial to manage one's digital footprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. While social media can facilitate connections, it also carries risks from "rude and helpful comments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. This necessitates re-evaluating how one interacts online to ensure personal digital security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.

[[understanding_crypto_bribes | Crypto bribes]] are a mechanism where a protocol openly offers a share of incentives to holders of a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) token to vote for their specific pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Unlike traditional bribes, [[understanding_crypto_bribes | crypto bribes]] are transparent and announced publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. This system is designed to change the game for DEXs by aligning incentives among various stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.

The fundamental relationship involves protocols seeking high liquidity, which liquidity providers (LPs) can offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. Traditionally, LPs might dump DEX tokens anytime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. With [[understanding_crypto_bribes | crypto bribes]], DEXs announce that a percentage of their token emission will be distributed based on votes, meaning the protocol with the highest votes receives the largest portion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. This creates a competitive environment where protocols fight for votes to increase their DEX token rewards for their pools, which in turn draws more LPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

## Case Study: Beats

Prior to January of a given year, the Beats token often faced selling pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:50">[02:49:50]</a>. However, starting on January 6th, Beats began offering bribes by dedicating 30% of their token emission to voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

### Impact of Crypto Bribes on Beats

*   **Increased Voting Traction**: People began actively voting for pools to receive their share of the emission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
*   **Boosted Demand**: As the voting mechanism gained traction, there was an increased desire for Beats tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   **Strong Buying Pressure**: This led to sustained buying pressure on the Beats token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.
*   **Holder Benefits**: Holders started to experience the advantages of participating in the bribe system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.
*   **Balanced Market**: While selling pressure wasn't eliminated, the buying pressure from bribes became significant enough to counteract it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

## Case Study: Spirit Swap

Spirit Swap is another DEX that has implemented [[understanding_crypto_bribes | crypto bribes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. An example of this involves "greater dal" conducting bribes with Spirit Swap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

### Impact of Crypto Bribes on Spirit Swap

*   **Incentive to Hold DEX Tokens**: The online incentive structure provides a compelling reason for users to hold DEX tokens, rather than selling them immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.
*   **Participation in Bribes**: It encourages participation in the [[understanding_crypto_bribes | crypto bribe]] system, allowing holders to earn additional yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.
*   **Buying Pressure on Protocol Tokens**: The system also adds buying pressure to the protocol's token (e.g., "creator token" in this context) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

## General [[impact_of_crypto_bribes_on_decentralized_exchange_dex_tokens | Impact of Crypto Bribes]] on DEX Tokens

The incentive alignment created by [[understanding_crypto_bribes | crypto bribes]] benefits various stakeholders:

*   **Stakers and LPs**: They are less likely to sell their DEX tokens because they can use them to vote and earn more yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
*   **Traders**: Benefit from low slippage due to increased liquidity in pools, leading to more trading fees for the DEX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.
*   **Protocols**: Gain from high liquidity and increased participant buying of their tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. This also adds buying pressure to the DEX token as holders seek more of the bribe rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

When evaluating DEX tokens for investment, it is advisable to seek out projects with similar incentive structures where all stakeholders' interests are aligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. Without such alignment, a DEX token might primarily function as a farming token, susceptible to immediate selling pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

Trust Treaty is a service built on a blockchain, designed to address common issues faced by freelancers and independent contractors, particularly in the Web3 space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It functions as an escrow service, essentially a refundable smart contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## How Trust Treaty Works

Clients can create a contract on Trust Treaty's platform, specifying details such as the contract title, expectations from both parties, start and end dates, and the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The price, which can be locked in USD, USDT, or USDC, includes a platform fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. When the client commits payment, the funds are moved to a new wallet address secured by the platform, to which neither the client nor the service provider has direct access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

Users are represented by wallet addresses, allowing designers or service providers to remain anonymous while still being part of a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Once all information is filled, the client signs the contract, generating a specific link to share with the service provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. The service provider then reviews and signs the contract to make it effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The platform also offers a UI for conversation between parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

Upon completion of the work, the service provider can request payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. If everything is in order, the client can finalize the agreement, releasing funds to the service provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Advantages of Trust Treaty

*   **Addresses Freelancer Pain Points**: Trust Treaty aims to solve the common issue of non-payment or disputes over work standards for freelancers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
*   **Formalized Contracts**: It provides a way to create fair and progressive contracts for freelancers, preventing "your words versus my words" situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **Web3 Solution**: Unlike Web2 platforms such as Upwork or Fiverr, Trust Treaty offers a Web3-native solution for freelancers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Secure Escrow**: Funds committed by the client are moved to a new wallet address secured by the platform, ensuring that the payment is held in escrow until the work is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Anonymity**: Users are represented by wallet addresses, allowing service providers to remain anonymous while engaging in work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Supports Remote Work**: The platform is well-suited for the increasing amount of remote work in the Web3 space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## Disadvantages and Risks of Trust Treaty

*   **Platform Risk**: If the Trust Treaty platform ceases to exist, the funds held in the funding wallet may also be lost, as the keys are not with the client or the service provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Dispute Decision Bias**: Although dispute agents are assigned to independently analyze situations, human bias might still be introduced into their decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### Dispute Resolution Process

If issues arise, either party can open a dispute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Both the client and service provider submit evidence, and two independent dispute agents are assigned to assess the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. If both agents agree, their decision is final, and funds are either sent to the provider or refunded to the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. If they disagree, a manager is called in to provide the final decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Financial Considerations

The platform charges a fee, which is automatically calculated and displayed as a "tax" when setting the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. In case of a dispute, a dispute cost is also applied, with both fees decreasing as the contract value increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. As of the current information, the platform does not have its own token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

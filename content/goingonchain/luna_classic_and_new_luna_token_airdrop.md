Following the [[luna_and_ust_collapse | collapse of Terra's ecosystem]], Do Kwon introduced a new plan for Terra. This plan involves a [[terra_luna_hard_fork_and_rebranding | hard fork]] of the existing chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Terra's Rebranding and New Chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
The original Luna token is now known as **Luna Classic** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. A new Terra chain has been launched, with its native token called **Luna**, which operates without a stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## New Luna Airdrop Details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
The new Luna tokens are being [[collecting_terra_luna_airdrops | airdropped]] to several groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>:
*   Luna Classic holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Luna Classic stakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   [[ust_mechanism_and_its_impact_on_luna | UST]] holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>
*   App developers, who are considered crucial for the new chain's viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>

### Airdrop Allocation and Vesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>
A significant portion of the new Luna tokens, specifically 25%, is allocated to [[ust_mechanism_and_its_impact_on_luna | UST]] holders at launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The airdrop was scheduled for May 27th at approximately 4 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

However, the tokens are subject to vesting periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. For example, [[ust_mechanism_and_its_impact_on_luna | UST]] holders initially receive only 10% of their allocated tokens at unlock, with the remaining balance vested over two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Considerations for the New Chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>
The hard fork essentially creates a new chain without a stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. A key concern for the new chain's success is developer adoption, as a lack of developers building on it would significantly hinder its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Other platforms like Polygon, Juno, and Phantom are actively trying to attract Terra's former developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

Despite the challenges, Terra's User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX) is noted for its superiority compared to other wallets like Metamask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. If this user experience can be replicated on another chain, it could be a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

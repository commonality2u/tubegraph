The [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] is an eight-week program designed to invite users to bridge assets over to Arbitrum and test out different protocols on the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. In return for participation, users are expected to receive unique NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Arbitrum is a Layer 2 solution that currently boasts the highest Total Value Locked (TVL) but does not yet have its own token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

The program's structure includes a "Bridge Week" (Week 1), followed by subsequent weeks (Week 2, Week 3, etc.) dedicated to testing selected protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The latest update suggests that the [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] is likely to go live in mid-June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Speculations about an Arbitrum Airdrop

There is significant [[speculations_about_an_arbitrum_airdrop | speculation]] that participation in the [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] might lead to an [[speculations_about_an_arbitrum_airdrop | airdrop]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This [[speculations_about_an_arbitrum_airdrop | speculation]] is partly fueled by the fact that its competitor, [[comparisons_between_arbitrum_and_optimism | Optimism]], previously released an airdrop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The [[eligibility_for_arbitrum_airdrop | eligibility criteria]] for Optimism's airdrop included bridging assets and using the Optimism network for a certain period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. An airdrop is considered a valuable opportunity, especially during a bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Bridging Process and Options

The first week of the [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] is dedicated to bridging assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Users are encouraged to be early adopters by bridging over and performing transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Official Bridge

When using the official bridge (`bridge.arbitrum.io`), it's important to note that:
*   There is a specific bridging time involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   Bridging assets back from Arbitrum (L2) to Ethereum mainnet (L1) can take approximately eight days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### Alternative Bridging via Hop Exchange

The long bridging time from L2 to L1 can be mitigated by using Hop Exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Hop Exchange allows users to transfer ETH from Arbitrum back to the mainnet immediately, though it incurs a small fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Bridging from Centralized Exchanges

It is currently unclear if bridging from centralized exchanges like Binance, Coinbase (CDC), or KuCoin to Arbitrum will count towards participation in the [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Further details are expected to be released with the official launch of Week 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Potential Rewards and Risks

Participants in the [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] can expect to receive NFTs, with more details to be announced upon the official launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The primary risk involved is the potential "wasting" of gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. However, the potential for an [[speculations_about_an_arbitrum_airdrop | Arbitrum airdrop]] is a significant return on investment (ROI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

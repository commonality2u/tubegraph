During volatile market periods, especially with rising [[interest_rates_and_fees_on_crypto_lending_platforms | interest rates]], it can be beneficial for crypto assets to generate yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This strategy aims to make assets "work harder" to potentially cover other financial obligations, such as mortgage interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Current Challenges with Centralized Finance (CeFi) Platforms

Many centralized finance (CeFi) platforms have faced issues, including withdrawal freezes or collapse, due to exposure to entities like Terra or 3AC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. As a result, some investors have withdrawn assets from services like Hodlnaut and Finblox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. However, removing assets from these platforms means they are no longer earning yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Methods for Earning Yield on Crypto Assets

Several approaches exist for earning interest on crypto assets:

### 1. Parking Assets on Centralized Exchanges (CeFi)

Many crypto exchanges offer services for users to earn interest on their holdings.

*   **KuCoin:** Users can lend out crypto assets for interest with specified terms (e.g., seven or fourteen days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. KuCoin Earn allows users to park stablecoins or Bitcoin to earn a certain Annual Percentage Rate (APR) with flexible or fixed tenures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **FTX App:** The FTX App offers a simpler interface compared to FTX Pro, primarily for buying, selling, depositing, and withdrawing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   **Yield Structure:** The first $10,000 of assets earns an 8% APY, while amounts exceeding $10,000 earn 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This can result in an blended APY, such as 6.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. All assets, including Ethereum, share the same APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
    *   **Transfers & Withdrawals:** Transfers of ERC20 tokens from FTX Pro to FTX App are free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, and withdrawals are also free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
    *   **Withdrawal Limits:** Without Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, the maximum withdrawal is $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
    *   **Withdrawal Options:** Funds can be withdrawn via international wire transfer to a foreign currency (USD) bank account or as USDC to a crypto wallet like MetaMask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
    *   **Source of Yield:** The yield likely comes from the platform lending assets to users for margin trading and borrowing, serving as a source of liquidity for lending and borrowing on FTX Pro, and potentially from marketing budgets to attract users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### 2. Parking Assets in Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

DeFi platforms offer alternative ways to earn yield, often through staking or providing liquidity.
*   **Liquid Staking:** Platforms like Lido or Rocket Pool allow users to stake Ethereum (ETH) and receive rewards, typically around 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Running a Node:** Running one's own node and staking can yield higher ETH rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### 3. Storing in Personal Wallet

The safest approach is to store crypto assets in a personal wallet, awaiting price appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This adheres to the principle of "your keys, your coin," meaning direct control over assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## [[managing_risk_with_crypto_investments | Risk Management]]

Earning interest on crypto assets is not risk-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. A significant risk is platform failure; if a platform like FTX were to cease operations, assets stored there could be lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. To mitigate this, [[managing_risk_with_crypto_investments | prudent risk management]] and diversification across different methods are recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

DC DAO is an OHM fork with a unique twist, aiming to become a "treasury of treasuries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The project is currently in its preview phase and has not yet launched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Building the Treasury

DC DAO intends to build its treasury through several mechanisms:

*   **Token Minting** Users can "bond" (mint) the EGS token at a discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. When users mint tokens, DC DAO accumulates assets for its treasury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Staking Rewards** Users can stake EGS tokens to earn interest, similar to other OHM forks like Wonderland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. In its initial phase, DC DAO projects an APY of 50,000% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The swap fees generated by their DEX are expected to help fund this APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>.
*   **DEX Swap Fees** A key component of their revenue model is the swap fees collected from their planned decentralized exchange (DEX), which will flow directly into the treasury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:45">[01:01:45]</a>.
*   **Initial NFT Offering (INO)** DC DAO plans an "Initial NFT Offering" (INO) where purchasing an NFT grants token allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:01">[02:01:01]</a>.
    *   There are three tiers of NFTs: God, Dante, and Damning God, with God being the highest tier starting at 4200 FTM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:14">[02:01:14]</a>.
    *   For example, acquiring a Dante NFT for 500 FTM could award up to 600 FTM worth of EGS allocation at pre-sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:25">[02:02:25]</a>.
    *   NFT ownership also provides special boosts, such as 2.5% in staking and 5% in bonding for the Dante tier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:41">[02:02:41]</a>.
    *   NFTs also qualify holders for a lottery, offering additional token allocation (e.g., a Bronze Dante tier could grant an extra 25% allocation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:47">[02:02:47]</a>.

### Tokenomics and Treasury Contribution

Regarding token distribution, 80% of the token offering will go to the NFT auction, ensuring a significant portion of tokens reach the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. The team retains 10%, and another 10% is allocated for initial liquidity supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:12">[03:03:12]</a>. The vesting period for the team's tokens is six months with a two-month cliff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:19">[03:03:19]</a>.

## Asset Accumulation Strategy

The core purpose of building the treasury is to accumulate various assets. DC DAO aims to gather assets such as [[investment_strategies_for_wmemo_spell_and_ice|wMEMO]], OHM, and MIN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### The DeFi DEX

The main reason for this accumulation is to build a decentralized exchange (DEX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This DEX will be populated with assets like [[investment_strategies_for_wmemo_spell_and_ice|wMEMO]], OHM, HECTOR, and EXODIA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

On this DEX, users can swap tokens, including EGS for [[investment_strategies_for_wmemo_spell_and_ice|wMEMO]], OHM, or HECTOR at specific times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. The team projects that completing one full cycle of these swaps could yield a 3.78% return, and performing this three times a day could result in an 11.34% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>. While currently manual, the team is exploring automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:23">[01:01:23]</a>. The goal of this DEX is to provide a single platform with deep liquidity, addressing issues of high slippage that currently exist for such swaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:38">[01:01:38]</a>.

### Team and Partnerships

The DC DAO team is anonymous but claims diverse experience, including backgrounds in banking, science, and law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:29">[03:02:29]</a>. DC DAO has also partnered with SpiritSwap, with one of SpiritSwap's members serving as a multi-sig signer for DC DAO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:36">[03:03:36]</a>.

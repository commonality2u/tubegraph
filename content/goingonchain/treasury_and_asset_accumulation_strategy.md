DC DAO is an Ohm fork aiming to become a "treasury of treasuries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>. This strategy involves accumulating a diverse range of assets to support its operations and create a unique decentralized exchange (DEX). This approach aligns with a [[building_cryptocurrency_investment_portfolio | building cryptocurrency investment portfolio]] or a broader [[crypto_portfolio_strategy | crypto portfolio strategy]].

## Building the Treasury

The treasury of DC DAO is built through several mechanisms:

*   **Bonding/Minting EGS Tokens** Users can "bond" their tokens by minting EGS at a discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. This process allows DC DAO to build up its treasury with various assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>.
*   **DEX Swap Fees** The project plans to implement a DEX where swap fees will go directly into the treasury as revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:45">[01:44:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:48">[01:47:48]</a>. This revenue stream can help fund the Annual Percentage Yield (APY) provided to EGS stakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:51">[01:49:51]</a>.
*   **Initial NFT Offering (INO)** DC DAO is conducting an Initial NFT Offering (INO) as its launch strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:03">[02:01:03]</a>. In this auction-based sale, 80% of the token offering will go to the NFT auction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:07">[03:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:07">[03:04:07]</a>, contributing significantly to the public distribution of tokens and the treasury's initial capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:09">[03:07:09]</a>.

## Accumulated Assets

DC DAO seeks to accumulate assets from other prominent decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, becoming a "treasury of treasuries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>. These assets include:

*   wMEMO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:54">[00:54:54]</a>
*   OHM (OlympusDAO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a>
*   MIN (Minion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a>
*   Hector (Hector DAO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a>
*   Exodia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">[00:57:58]</a>

## Purpose of Asset Accumulation: The DEX

The primary reason for accumulating these diverse assets is to build a decentralized exchange (DEX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a>. This DEX will be filled with the accumulated assets from projects like wMEMO, OHM, Hector, and Exodia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:58">[00:52:58]</a>.

### DEX Functionality

Users will be able to swap tokens on this DEX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. A proposed cycle involves swapping EGS tokens after a rebase for wMEMO, then wMEMO for OHM, and subsequently OHM for Hector, and so forth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>. This unique swapping mechanism allows users to cycle through different tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:34">[01:28:34]</a>.

### Potential Returns

The team estimates that a user can make approximately 3.78% in one full cycle on the DEX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:16">[01:13:16]</a>. If this process is repeated three times a day, a user could potentially make about 11.34% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>. While currently manual, the team is exploring ways to automate this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>.

### Liquidity and Slippage

A key benefit of DC DAO's DEX is its potential to offer deep liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:40">[01:38:40]</a>. This deep liquidity aims to solve issues of high slippage that users might encounter when performing similar swaps on other platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:42">[01:39:42]</a>.

### Funding APY

The swap fees generated from the DEX will contribute directly to the treasury, acting as revenue that can help fund the APY offered to EGS stakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:54">[01:47:54]</a>. Staking EGS to earn interest is a form of [[supplying_assets_for_yield | supplying assets for yield]] within this [[cryptocurrency_investment_approach | cryptocurrency investment approach]].

Hundred Finance is a multi-chain platform primarily used for [[introduction_to_cryptocurrency_lending_platforms | lending and borrowing]] crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. It is currently operational on several networks, with the Fantom network being a common choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Beyond basic lending and borrowing, there are multiple strategies to [[earning_yield_on_hundred_finance | earn yield]] on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

This article focuses on two specific ways to [[earning_yield_on_hundred_finance | earn yield]] on Hundred Finance: [[liquidity_providers_and_incentives | providing liquidity]] and utilizing Lendi.

## Providing Liquidity

One method to [[earning_yield_on_hundred_finance | earn yield]] on Hundred Finance is by [[liquidity_providers_and_incentives | providing liquidity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

To access this option, users can click on "HND" within the platform interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This section displays activity related to [[liquidity_providers_and_incentives | liquidity provision]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

The [[liquidity_providers_and_incentives | liquidity]] is added in a specific proportion: 60% HND, 20% FTM, and 20% USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Users [[liquidity_providers_and_incentives | providing liquidity]] in this manner can achieve a combined Annual Percentage Rate (APR) of 110% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Using Lendi

The fifth way to [[earning_yield_on_hundred_finance | earn yield]] on Hundred Finance involves using "Lendi," which is described as a special deployment by the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

The primary goal of Lendi is for the Hundred Finance team to borrow USDC from users, using HND as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This borrowed USDC is then used by the team to [[liquidity_providers_and_incentives | provide liquidity]] to the HND/WFTM pool on Solidly, allowing them to receive Solid emission rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

For users who [[liquidity_providers_and_incentives | provide USDC]] to the team through Lendi, the current Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is 34.25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This is considered a very good yield, especially for stablecoin deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

To withdraw rewards earned from Lendi, users can navigate to the "Stick" section and then select "Claim HND" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Summary of Lendi engagement:
> *   The team borrows USDC from users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
> *   HND is used as collateral for the team's borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
> *   The team utilizes the USDC to [[liquidity_providers_and_incentives | provide liquidity]] on the HND/WFTM pool in Solidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
> *   Users [[liquidity_providers_and_incentives | providing USDC]] to the team earn 34.25% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

These strategies highlight the flexibility and potential for [[earning_yield_on_hundred_finance | earning yield]] within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem on platforms like Hundred Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

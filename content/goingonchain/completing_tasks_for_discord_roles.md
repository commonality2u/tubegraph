Arbitrum, a major Layer 2 (L2) solution, is believed to be likely to launch its own token and conduct an airdrop for early users, similar to Optimism's OP airdrop [00:00:09]. To qualify as an early user, individuals need to complete specific tasks [00:00:18].

## Background: Arbitrum Odyssey

Initially, Arbitrum introduced a program called [[Arbitrum Odyssey campaign overview | Arbitrum Odyssey]] [00:00:22]. This program involved several tasks, such as bridging assets, which would reward participants with an NFT [00:00:30]. It was designed as an eight-week program with weekly tasks [00:00:34].

However, [[Arbitrum Odyssey campaign overview | Arbitrum Odyssey]] was halted due to excessive network traffic and a spike in gas prices, driven by speculation surrounding a potential airdrop [00:00:39]. The solution was the introduction of Nitro, an upgrade to the chain designed to handle more traffic [00:00:46]. Nitro went live on August 31st [00:00:53], but the [[Arbitrum Odyssey campaign overview | Arbitrum Odyssey]] program did not resume [00:00:55].

## The Current Program: Quest to Earn Roles

Currently, another program exists, described as a "quest to earn roles" on Arbitrum's Discord server [00:00:59]. While officially stated to be only for obtaining Discord roles [00:01:09], there is significant speculation that participation might still qualify users for a future airdrop [00:01:04]. Approximately 50,000 people have participated despite this being pure speculation [00:01:13]. The estimated cost to participate is around 0.02 ETH plus gas fees [00:01:17]. Completing these tasks grants access to different roles within the Arbitrum Discord server [00:01:21].

## How to Participate

To participate, navigate to `guild.xyz/arbitrum` [00:01:36]. Participants will need to connect their cryptocurrency wallet, Discord account, and Twitter handle [00:01:39].

The tasks primarily involve purchasing small amounts of various tokens [00:01:46]. For example, participants might need to acquire as little as 0.01 JMX [00:01:57]. Most required tokens can be acquired on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap or SushiSwap [00:02:01].

### Safety Tip for Token Purchases

When purchasing tokens, it's crucial to ensure you are buying the correct asset to avoid scam tokens [00:02:27]. A safer method is to:
1.  View the token on an explorer [00:02:34].
2.  Copy the contract address directly from the explorer [00:02:36].
3.  Paste the contract address into the decentralized exchange (e.g., Uniswap) to select the correct token [00:02:38].

### Arbitrum Odyssey Task

One specific task within this program, related to the past [[Arbitrum Odyssey campaign overview | Arbitrum Odyssey]] program, requires purchasing an NFT [00:02:07]. This NFT can be acquired on the Extra Toast marketplace [00:02:16]. This task specifically relates to [[Collecting NFTs and Airdrops in Arbitrum Odyssey | collecting NFTs and airdrops in Arbitrum Odyssey]].

## Completion and Outcome

After making the required purchases and completing all tasks, returning to Guild.xyz will refresh the page, granting access to the specific Discord roles [00:02:51]. The entire process can take approximately 30 minutes to complete manually [00:02:59].

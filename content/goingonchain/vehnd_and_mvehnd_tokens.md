Hundred Finance has introduced a new "mirroring event" that allows users to transfer their locked veHND tokens across different chains where the protocol operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This development significantly benefits holders by enhancing the [[utility_of_dex_tokens | utility]] of their tokens across a multichain environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Obtaining and Using HND Tokens

Hundred Finance is a multichain lending and borrowing protocol available on 8 different chains, including Polygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Users can stake or supply assets to earn yield, or participate in backstop provision for liquidation events, which also earns yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. When earning yield on Hundred Finance, users receive [[using_htokens_and_earning_hnd | HND tokens]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Understanding mveHND

After acquiring HND tokens, users can [[locking_hnd_for_vehnd_rewards | lock them up]] to convert them into mveHND <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The mveHND token serves several key functions:
*   **Voting for Pools** With mveHND, users can [[voting_and_boosting_apr_using_mvehnd | vote]] for specific liquidity pools within Hundred Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Boosting APR** Voting for a pool allows users to [[boosting_rewards_with_vehnd_voting | boost]] the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) they earn on their staked or supplied assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. To achieve the maximum boost of 2.5x, a sufficient amount of [[using_hnd_tokens_for_boosting_yield | HND tokens]] must be locked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. For example, locking 300 HND for four years can provide a 1.5x boost, while 1000 HND can achieve the maximum 2.5x boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. The primary benefit of [[locking_hnd_for_vehnd_rewards | locking HND]] is to earn more rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## The Mirroring Event

The mirroring event is a significant development that allows users to transfer their locked veHND (which is then recognized as mveHND on the target chain) between different chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This feature addresses the issue of "double locking," where users would previously need to lock HND separately on each chain they used Hundred Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### How Mirroring Works
Hundred Finance utilizes LayerZero service to facilitate this cross-chain transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Users can mirror their locked tokens from one chain to another, such as from Fantom to Polygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Once mirrored, the mveHND can be used to vote and boost APRs on the destination chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Supported Chains
Currently, mveHND mirroring is supported on:
*   Arbitrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
*   Fantom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
*   Optimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
*   Polygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>

While not all directions are ready, mirroring from Fantom to Polygon is functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### Mirroring Process
1.  Navigate to the "vote" page on the source chain (e.g., Fantom) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
2.  Select the "Mirror lock to a target chain" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
3.  Choose the desired destination chain where you want to mirror your veHND <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
4.  Click "Mirror" and approve the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

This feature provides a strong incentive for users to engage with Hundred Finance across multiple chains, as they can seamlessly transfer their boosting power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

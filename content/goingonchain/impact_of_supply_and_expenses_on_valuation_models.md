Common [[valuation_models_for_defi_protocols | valuation models]] for DeFi protocols often rely on comparing metrics to assess how protocols generate revenue and fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>. Typically, these models calculate volume and the fees generated from that volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>. From this, a ratio is derived to estimate the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:09">[01:24:09]</a>. The P/E ratio then allows for an assessment of whether a platform might be undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:43">[01:28:43]</a>.

## Key Considerations for Valuation

When using [[valuation_models_for_defi_protocols | valuation models]], specific factors related to supply and expenses significantly influence the results:

*   **Supply Figures**
    It's crucial to determine which supply figure to use (e.g., circulating supply versus total supply) as this choice can lead to very different valuation results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:87">[01:50:87]</a>.
*   **Expenses (Emissions)**
    Token emissions can be treated as expenses because they are used to attract users to the protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:53">[02:00:53]</a>.

## Tools for Data Collection

Several tools can assist in gathering the necessary data for these [[valuation_models_for_defi_protocols | valuation models]]:

*   **Token Terminal** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:53">[01:32:53]</a>
*   **Dune** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:83">[01:35:83]</a>: Features informative dashboards built by contributors.
*   **Protocol Statistic Pages** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:83">[01:44:83]</a>: Many protocols host their own pages providing relevant statistics.

There isn't a single "right" or "wrong" [[valuation_models_for_defi_protocols | model]]; the best approach depends on how one chooses to construct it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:38">[02:22:38]</a>.

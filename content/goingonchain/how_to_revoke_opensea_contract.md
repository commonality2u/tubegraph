An [[opensea_phishing_attack | Opensea phishing attack]] has recently occurred, affecting 17 users who accidentally fell victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The hacker's wallet has reportedly sent the stolen Ethereum (ETH) to Tornado Cash, an untraceable crypto "washing machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Context of the Attack

This situation began when Opensea released a new [[smart_contract_migration_issues_on_opensea | smart contract]] and requested users to migrate their listings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The purpose of this new contract was to upgrade and delete inactive NFTs on Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, addressing previous incidents where users lost NFTs due to inactive listings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Opensea shared the new contract link on its Twitter channel and via email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, which may have been exploited by hackers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Some users have also suggested a flaw in the Opensea contract itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Steps to Revoke Your Approval

To enhance your security and revoke your approval to Opensea, you can follow these steps:

2.  Choose the "Approval" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
3.  If you have granted Opensea access, you will see the approval listed there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
4.  You should revoke this access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

> [!warning] Important Considerations
> When revoking a contract, it incurs gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Since you are performing this action on Ethereum, be mindful of the fluctuating gas prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

NFTs can be utilized to generate passive income, moving beyond simple trading to offer daily returns through various mechanisms, often involving staking or earning project-specific tokens that have their own utility or market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## CyberKongz

Considered an "OG" for passive income in the NFT space, the CyberKongz collection consists of 1,000 NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

*   **Floor Price**: As of the recording, the floor price for a CyberKongz NFT is 155 ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   **Daily Earnings**: Owning a CyberKong allows holders to earn 10 "Bananas" per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   **Banana Value**: Each Banana is valued at $75, translating to a daily passive income of $750 from one CyberKong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **[[Utility and Use Cases of NFT Tokens | Utility of Bananas]]**: Bananas are not just a farming token; they serve multiple purposes within the CyberKongz ecosystem, ensuring a market for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. These include:
    *   Setting a biography for your CyberKong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
    *   Renaming your CyberKong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
    *   Breeding new "BabyKongz" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Bear Deluxe

Another NFT project offering passive income is Bear Deluxe, with a total supply of 6,900 NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

*   **Floor Price**: The floor price for a Bear Deluxe NFT is 2.55 ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Daily Earnings**: Each Bear Deluxe NFT earns one "Jug of Honey" per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Honey Utility**: While the price of Honey is not yet established, it has specific [[Utility and Use Cases of NFT Tokens | utility]]. For instance, Honey can be combined with a beehive to transform into a "B the Lightning," which is capable of minting 0.13 Honey per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This functionality contributes to the increasing gamification of NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>.

## Non-Mine

Non-Mine NFTs operate with a different passive income model, focusing on staking and breeding mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>.

*   **Floor Price**: The floor price for a Non-Mine NFT is approximately 9 ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>.
*   **Supply**: Initially, 10,000 "minted mice" were created, but 6,450 have since been burned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>. The remaining 3,550 mice are the only ones capable of breeding new mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>.
*   **[[Strategies for earning interest on crypto assets | Passive Income Mechanism]]**:
    *   **Staking**: Holders can stake their mice to earn "Cheese" â€“ one Cheese per mouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:22]</a>. A maximum of 10 mice can be staked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:26">[01:01:26]</a>.
    *   **Purchasing Cheese**: Cheese can also be acquired through Uniswap or private sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:28">[01:01:28]</a>.
    *   **Breeding**: With Cheese, two mice can be bred to produce another mouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>.
    *   **Breeding Conditions**: When breeding, the two original mice are burned, and the newly produced mouse cannot be bred further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>.

## Considerations for Passive Income NFTs

While NFTs like CyberKongz, Bear Deluxe, and Non-Mine offer passive income streams through daily token emissions (Bananas, Honey, Cheese), it's crucial to understand the underlying [[Utility and Use Cases of NFT Tokens | use cases]] of these tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>. Without utility, these "farming tokens" could be subject to dumping, impacting their value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>. It is important to conduct personal research before investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:48">[01:01:48]</a>.

[[overview_and_introduction_of_astroport_as_a_next_generation_amm_on_terra | Astroport]] is a decentralized automated market maker (AMM) on the Terra blockchain, designed to offer advanced features compared to existing platforms like Terraswap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It aims to address several limitations of traditional AMMs and provide a more robust and user-friendly experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Why Terra Needed a New AMM

While Terraswap was the existing AMM on Terra, it had several limitations that Astroport aims to overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>:

*   **Purpose-Built Limitations**
    *   Terraswap was initially built to support the Miro protocol and was not designed to be a full-fledged AMM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Basic User Interface and Experience (UI/UX)**
    *   Terraswap provides only a very basic swapping function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. In contrast, other AMMs like SpiritSwap offer more comprehensive features such as charts and APY displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Limited Pool Types**
    *   Traditional AMMs, including Terraswap, typically only support one type of liquidity pool: the "constant product" formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This formula, popularized by Uniswap, is effective for pairs with high volatility, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
    *   However, the constant product model is not suitable for stablecoin pools or newly launched [[token | tokens]], often leading to significant slippage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Loss of Native Protocol Benefits**
    *   When users provide liquidity on Terraswap, they may lose out on benefits that would otherwise be earned by providing liquidity directly on the native protocol. For example, providing ANC/UST liquidity on Terraswap means missing out on the native Anchor Protocol benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Astroport's Solutions and Advantages

Astroport is designed to address these issues by offering several key improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>:

*   **Enhanced UI/UX**
    *   Astroport aims to provide a much better UI/UX, including chart trends and a more user-friendly interface beyond a simple swap screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Multiple Pool Types**
    *   Instead of a single constant product pool, Astroport will offer three different types of liquidity pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This diversity is intended to benefit users by enabling better exchange rates and significantly reducing slippage across various asset pairs, including stablecoins and new [[token | tokens]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **[[features_and_advantages_of_astroport_including_user_interface_and_astro_generators | Astro Generators]] (Double Farming)**
    *   Astroport introduces [[features_and_advantages_of_astroport_including_user_interface_and_astro_generators | Astro Generators]], a powerful feature that allows for "double farming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. If users provide liquidity, such as ANC/UST, to an [[features_and_advantages_of_astroport_including_user_interface_and_astro_generators | Astro Generator]], it will use a proxy smart contract to link their liquidity to the native protocol. This enables users to earn the benefits from the underlying protocol (e.g., Anchor benefits for ANC/UST) in addition to the Astroport [[token | tokens]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This means users can earn two types of [[token | tokens]] by providing liquidity in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

Astroport is being developed by teams from Delphi Digital, Ideo, and Terraform Labs, known as the Astroport Joint Ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Its launch will involve a [[launch_details_and_token_drop_phases_for_astroport | token drop]] across three phases, rather than an Initial Dex Offering (IDO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

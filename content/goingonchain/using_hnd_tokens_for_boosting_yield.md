Hundred Finance is a multi-chain platform for lending and borrowing, similar to Compound, currently operating on several networks, including the Phantom network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Users can [[earning_yield_on_hundred_finance | earn yield]] on the platform, and owning HND tokens can significantly [[boosting_rewards_with_vehnd_voting | boost these earnings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## How to Boost Your Yield with HND <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>

To achieve higher Annual Percentage Rates (APR), such as 27% on certain strategies, you need to acquire and [[locking_hnd_for_vehnd_rewards | lock up HND tokens]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Locking HND for veHND <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
The process involves converting your HND tokens into [[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | veHND tokens]]:
1.  Navigate to the "Vote" section on the Hundred Finance platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
2.  Deposit and [[locking_hnd_for_vehnd_rewards | lock your HND tokens]] to receive [[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | veHND]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Voting with veHND for Gauge Boosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
Once you hold [[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | veHND]], you can use it to [[voting_and_boosting_apr_using_mvehnd | vote on specific gauges]] (pools) where you have supplied assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. For example, if you are providing liquidity in a MIM pool, you would [[voting_and_boosting_apr_using_mvehnd | vote for MIM]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Understanding Boost Multipliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>
The amount of boost you receive depends on the quantity of HND locked and the duration of the lock-up period:
*   **Maximum Boost:** The highest boost achievable is 2.5x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Example:** Staking $3,000 and locking approximately 300 HND for four years can result in a 2.5x boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Shorter Lock-ups:** Locking HND for a shorter period, such as one year, would yield a lower boost, for instance, 1.46x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

Hundred Finance provides a boost calculator to estimate the APR you can expect based on your lock-up choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> Locking HND and [[voting_and_boosting_apr_using_mvehnd | voting with veHND]] allows users to significantly enhance their [[earning_yield_on_hundred_finance | yield earnings]] on assets supplied to Hundred Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This strategy makes your existing assets "work harder" to generate more yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

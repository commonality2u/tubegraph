Trust Treaty is a service built on a blockchain designed to address payment pain points often experienced by freelancers and independent contractors in both Web2 and Web3 spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It functions as an escrow service, essentially a refundable smart contract, aiming to prevent situations where clients refuse to pay or disputes arise over project standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Unlike Web2 platforms such as Upwork, Fiverr, or Dynamic Design, Trust Treaty provides a blockchain-based solution for Web3 freelancers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## How Trust Treaty Works

The platform facilitates secure agreements between clients and service providers using smart contracts.

### Contract Creation
1.  **Initiation**: A client (e.g., "Alice") looking to hire a service provider (e.g., "Bob") creates a new contract on the Trust Treaty platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
2.  **Contract Details**: The client fills in critical information, including:
    *   Contract title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
    *   Detailed expectations from both parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
    *   Start and end dates for the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
    *   The agreed-upon price, which can be locked in USD, USDT, or USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Fees and Fund Management
*   **Platform Fee**: A percentage of the contract value is charged as a platform fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Dispute Cost**: A maximum dispute cost (e.g., 50) is indicated, which decreases with larger contract figures, similar to the platform tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Secured Funds**: When the client commits payment, the funds are moved to a new wallet address. This wallet is secured by the platform, and neither the client nor the service provider has direct access to it, ensuring funds are held in escrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Anonymity and Agreement
*   **Wallet Addresses**: Users are represented by their wallet addresses, allowing for anonymity. A designer can work for a client while remaining non-anonymous if they choose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Client Signature**: Once details are filled, the client signs the contract, generating a unique link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Service Provider Acceptance**: The client shares this link with the service provider. The service provider reviews the contract title, details, and settlement value, then signs it to make it effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Project Execution and Payment
*   **Communication**: With the contract effective, both parties can communicate using the platform's UI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Payment Request**: Upon completion of the work, the service provider can request payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Fund Release**: If the client is satisfied, they finalize the agreement, which releases the funds to the service provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Dispute Resolution
In case of issues, a dispute mechanism is in place:
1.  **Dispute Initiation**: The client can open a dispute if unsatisfied with the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
2.  **Evidence Submission**: Both the client and service provider submit evidence to support their case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
3.  **Dispute Agents**: Two independent dispute agents are assigned to analyze the situation and provide their assessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
4.  **Decision**:
    *   If both agents agree, their decision is final, and funds are either released to the provider or refunded to the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
    *   If agents disagree, a manager intervenes to make the final decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Use Cases and Risks

### Use Cases
Trust Treaty is particularly interesting for the growing number of remote work opportunities in the Web3 space, providing a secure method for transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### Risks
*   **Platform Risk**: If the Trust Treaty platform ceases to exist, the funds in the escrow wallet could be inaccessible because the keys are not held by the client or service provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Human Bias**: While dispute agents make independent decisions, their human involvement could still introduce bias into the resolution process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## Disclosure
As of the transcript, the Trust Treaty platform does not yet have its own token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

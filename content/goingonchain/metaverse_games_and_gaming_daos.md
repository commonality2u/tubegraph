The speaker highlights [[multichain_projects_and_investment | metaverse]] games as a key area of interest for 2022, despite a recent decline in the price of [[multichain_projects_and_investment | metaverse]] tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Games are considered a crucial component for driving crypto adoption, especially those that incorporate decentralized finance (DeFi) elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Key Observations on Metaverse Games
*   **Adoption Driver** Metaverse games, particularly those with DeFi integration, are seen as key to broader crypto adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **DeFi Kingdom Example** DeFi Kingdom is cited as a successful example, where a blend of gaming and DeFi has maintained price growth even during bearish market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Focus on Gaming DAOs
Instead of directly investing in games, the speaker prefers to focus on gaming Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
Gaming DAOs function similarly to talent agencies:
*   They recruit players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   Players engage in games and earn revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   A portion of the revenue is shared back with the DAO's treasury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### Examples of Gaming DAOs
*   **Yield Guild Games (YGG)**
    *   YGG reported a treasury of $845 million as of September data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
    *   YGG SEA is highlighted as a sub-DAO of YGG and is on the speaker's watchlist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Avocado Guild**
    *   Avocado Guild's token is yet to launch but is considered very exciting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
    *   The speaker expresses hope for a partnership between Heroes and Empire and Avocado Guild <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Merit Circle**
    *   Merit Circle is currently part of the speaker's portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

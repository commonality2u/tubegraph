Metaverse games are identified as a key area of interest in the crypto space for 2022, despite the price of their associated tokens potentially coming down from previous highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. These games are considered crucial for driving broader crypto adoption, particularly those that integrate decentralized finance (DeFi) elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

An example of a successful game combining gaming and DeFi is Defi Kingdom, which has seen its price continue to rise even during bearish market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Focus on Gaming DAOs

Instead of directly investing in games, a strategy involves looking into gaming Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. These DAOs function similarly to talent agencies:
*   They recruit players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   Players participate in games to earn rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   The DAO and players engage in profit sharing, with a portion of the revenue directed back to the DAO's treasury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Notable Gaming DAOs

*   **Yield Guild Games (YGG)**: This is a prominent gaming DAO. As of September data, YGG held 845 million in its treasury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
    *   **YGG SEA**: A sub-DAO of YGG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Mary Circle**: This is currently part of the speaker's portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Avocado Guild**: This project is on the watchlist, with its token yet to launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. There is hope for a future partnership between Heroes & Empire and Avocado Guild <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

The year 2022 was described as "down bad" for crypto, with the market declining by approximately 80% to 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This period was marked by significant pain and lessons learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, including a variety of scams and fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Key Events and Their Chain Reactions

The year saw several major incidents that deeply affected investors:
*   **Wonderland Rug Pull** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   **Federal Reserve Interest Rate Hikes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>: Raising rates from 0.25% to 4.375% stopped "money printers," causing risk capital to dry up and initiating a liquidity crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Fall of [[luna_and_ust_collapse | Luna]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>: This event was described as hitting the speaker hardest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, acting as a "House of Cards" that triggered a chain reaction in May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **[[Comparison of BlockFi Celsius Network and Hodlnaut | Celsius]] and 3AC Troubles** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>: In June, [[Comparison of BlockFi Celsius Network and Hodlnaut | Celsius]] halted withdrawals, followed by the liquidation of Three Arrows Capital (3AC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **FTX Chapter 11 and SPF Fraud** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Personal Impact

The speaker personally experienced significant losses, stating they were "red carded" by Wonderland and [[luna_and_ust_collapse | Terra Luna]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This underscores a key takeaway: if one doesn't understand the origin of the yield, they are the yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Key Takeaways for Investors

### 1. Understanding Yield and On-Chain Data
The speaker initially believed they understood yield mechanisms during the bull market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. However, experiences with Wonderland and [[luna_and_ust_collapse | Terra Luna]] proved otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. To make more informed decisions, the speaker began learning skills like Python and SQL to extract and comprehend on-chain data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Following thought leaders is one thing, but observing their on-chain actions provides a different level of insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### 2. Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins
The cases of [[Comparison of BlockFi Celsius Network and Hodlnaut | Celsius]], Hodlnaut, and FTX highlight the critical importance of self-custodying assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. While centralized exchanges (CEX) like Binance and Crypto.com are still used for on/off-ramping, large sums of assets are not kept on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Assets are quickly moved to personal wallets after transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This concern about trust in CEX platforms is seen as building a stronger use case for decentralized finance (DeFi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### 3. Managing Digital Footprint
The speaker is now focusing on managing their digital footprint, re-evaluating how they access online platforms due to the presence of trolls and unhelpful comments on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

This article discusses [[introduction_to_cryptocurrency_lending_platforms | crypto lending platforms]] and their potential for earning interest on cryptocurrency assets. It covers how these platforms operate, highlights specific platforms, and compares their features and interest rates.

## What are Crypto Lending Platforms?

[[introduction_to_cryptocurrency_lending_platforms | Crypto lending platforms]] function similarly to P2P (peer-to-peer) lending services, such as Funding Societies or MoolahSense [00:00:17]. Users can participate as either a lender or a [[borrowing_against_crypto_assets | borrower]] [00:00:23].

*   **As a lender**: You lend out crypto assets and, in return, receive interest [00:00:25].
*   **As a borrower**: You deposit crypto as collateral to obtain a loan. Once the loan and interest are repaid, your crypto collateral is returned [00:00:32].

## Featured Crypto Lending Platforms

Three platforms are highlighted: BlockFi, Celsius Network, and Hodlnaut [00:00:37].

### BlockFi

BlockFi is a well-known platform, regulated in the U.S. [00:01:05].

*   **Example Earnings**: Lending 10,000 USDC (a [[earning_interest_on_stablecoins | stablecoin]] pegged to the US Dollar) could yield approximately $860 in interest over one year, significantly higher than traditional bank offerings [00:01:11].

## Interest Rate Comparison

While Hodlnaut offers the highest rates for [[earning_interest_on_stablecoins | stablecoins]], Celsius Network stands out due to its lack of [[features_and_fees_of_crypto_lending_platforms | withdrawal fees]], wider selection of coins, weekly payouts, and competitive interest rates [00:02:31].

## [[considerations_and_risks_in_using_crypto_lending_platforms | Considerations and Risks]]

It's important to consider the [[considerations_and_risks_in_using_crypto_lending_platforms | risks]] involved. If a platform, such as Celsius Network, were to fail, any funds held on it would also be lost [00:02:40].

## Strategies for Earning Interest

*   If you already possess cryptocurrencies, consider [[strategies_for_earning_interest_on_crypto_assets | lending them out]] to earn interest [00:02:47].
*   If you don't own crypto, consider buying [[earning_interest_on_stablecoins | stablecoins]] like USDT or USDC. These are crypto assets backed by the USD, offering significantly higher interest rates compared to traditional banks [00:02:50].

The [[Optimism and Arbitrum airdrops | Arbitrum Odyssey]] was an initial program designed to identify early users for a potential [[Arbitrum airdrop speculation | Arbitrum airdrop opportunity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While Optimism (OP) airdropped tokens to early users, Arbitrum was also believed to be likely to have a token, requiring specific tasks for user qualification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Program Structure and Incentives

The program was initially planned to be an eight-week event, with new tasks released each week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. A key task involved [[bridging_to_arbitrum | bridging]] assets over to the Arbitrum network, which would reward participants with an NFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Suspension of the Program

The [[Optimism and Arbitrum airdrops | Arbitrum Odyssey]] program was stopped prematurely due to an overwhelming influx of traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This surge in activity, driven by [[arbitrum_airdrop_speculation | speculation on the airdrop]], caused a significant spike in gas prices on the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

> "They stop Avital Odyssey because there was too many traffic coming in and the gas price spike everyone was coming in because of the speculation on the airdrop." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>

## Post-Odyssey Developments

To address the network congestion, Arbitrum introduced [[introduction_to_arbitrum_nitro_upgrade | Nitro]], an upgrade designed to allow for more traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. [[introduction_to_arbitrum_nitro_upgrade | Nitro]] went live on August 31st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>; however, the [[Optimism and Arbitrum airdrops | Arbitrum Odyssey]] program did not return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

Despite the conclusion of the Odyssey, a new program emerged involving quests to earn roles on the Arbitrum Discord server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. While this program explicitly states it's only for Discord roles and "literally nothing" else, approximately 50,000 people still participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This participation is driven by continued [[speculation_on_arbitrum_token_eligibility | speculation about a future airdrop]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

One of the tasks in this current program is referred to as the "Odyssey C task" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. For those aiming to complete everything in the current quest, an NFT purchase is required, which is available on Extra Toast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

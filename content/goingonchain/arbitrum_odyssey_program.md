The [[overview_of_arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] was an initial program designed by Arbitrum to engage early users and qualify them for potential future benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Program Structure and Tasks

The program involved several tasks, such as [[bridging_process_and_options_for_arbitrum | bridging]] assets over to the Arbitrum network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Upon completing these tasks, users would receive an NFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. It was intended to be an eight-week program, with new tasks introduced each week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Program Suspension

The [[overview_of_arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] program was suspended due to excessive network traffic, which caused a significant spike in gas prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This surge in activity was largely attributed to [[speculations_about_an_arbitrum_airdrop | speculation about a potential Arbitrum airdrop]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Post-Suspension

To address the network congestion, Arbitrum introduced [[arbitrum_nitro_and_its_potential_benefits | Arbitrum Nitro]], an upgrade designed to handle more traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. [[arbitrum_nitro_and_its_potential_benefits | Nitro]] went live on August 31st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. However, the [[overview_of_arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] program did not resume after the upgrade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

Although the program is over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, if a user aims to complete tasks that were part of the Odyssey (e.g., for Discord roles), they might need to acquire an NFT related to the program, possibly through secondary markets like OpenSea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

Bend Dao is a lending and borrowing platform specifically designed for NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. It has recently gained attention in the NFT market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Core Functionality

### Lending and Borrowing NFTs
Users can deposit their NFTs on Bend Dao to borrow ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Currently, borrowing ETH with an NFT incurs a high negative [[interest_rates_and_discounts_on_bend_dao | interest rate]] of minus 92% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This unusual rate is due to an insufficient supply of deposits on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Bend Dao accepts only seven selected "blue chip" NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Buying NFTs at a [[interest_rates_and_discounts_on_bend_dao | Discount]]
The platform allows users to buy NFTs at a [[interest_rates_and_discounts_on_bend_dao | discount]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, using what they call a "down payment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. For instance, a MAYWC NFT with a full price of 14.6 ETH can be acquired for 11.05 ETH, with the remaining amount considered a loan from the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The borrowed amount can be paid back at any time, subject to interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Supplying ETH for High APR
Users can supply ETH to the platform to earn a high APR (Annual Percentage Rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. As of the transcript, the utilization rate for supplied ETH is approximately 95% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Bidding on Liquidating NFTs
Bend Dao also facilitates bidding on liquidating NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. If an NFT owner, such as an owner of a MYC NFT, borrowed 10.82 ETH and its floor price is now 12.32 ETH, the NFT enters a liquidating state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The owner has 48 hours to redeem the NFT; otherwise, it goes to the highest bidder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The bid price must always be greater than the current highest bid price plus one percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Challenges and Considerations
There are two main issues noted with the platform:
1.  **High Utilization Rate Risk** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>: A high utilization rate means that ETH lenders might not be able to withdraw their funds when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
2.  **Bidder Risk** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>: When participating in a bid, bidders must lock up their ETH for 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This poses a risk for the bidder, which can discourage participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. As a result, not many people are currently bidding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

Bend Dao aims to provide [[providing_liquidity_through_platforms | liquidity]] for NFT holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. However, it needs to address these challenges to fully realize its potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

Rabby is a cryptocurrency wallet presented as an alternative to [[metamask_security_features | Metamask]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It is developed by Debank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a> and functions as a Chrome extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Features and User Experience

Rabby wallet claims to offer a smooth multi-chain experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. However, it has been noted to occasionally misidentify the connected blockchain, such as thinking a user is on a different chain when visiting a Fantom site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Security Features

A significant and powerful feature of Rabby wallet is its dedicated "Security" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This feature addresses key aspects of [[security_measures_for_cryptocurrency_wallets | cryptocurrency security]] by providing transparency and control over token approvals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Token Approval Management

The security feature allows users to view a comprehensive list of all token approvals they have granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This includes details such as:
*   The specific token, e.g., USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   The protocols or projects to which access has been granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   The type of access, for instance, "infinite" (unlimited) access to a user's funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

This visibility is crucial because if a project with infinite access to a user's tokens gets compromised, the user's assets would be affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Rabby also highlights approvals given to "unknown projects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, further enhancing [[importance_of_cryptocurrency_security | security]].

### Revoking Approvals

One distinct advantage of Rabby wallet is the ability to decline or revoke existing token approvals directly within the wallet interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This functionality is not available in [[metamask_security_features | Metamask]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, making Rabby a more proactive tool for managing potential vulnerabilities that could lead to [[how_cryptocurrency_wallets_are_manipulated_in_scams | wallet manipulation or scams]].

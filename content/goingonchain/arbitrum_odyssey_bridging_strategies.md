The [[Arbitrum Odyssey program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] is an eight-week campaign designed to encourage users to try out Arbitrum, offering [[NFT incentives from bridging on Arbitrum | NFTs]] in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. While the [[NFT incentives from bridging on Arbitrum | NFTs]] themselves may or may not have resale value, the campaign is widely speculated to be a criterion for a potential [[Arbitrum airdrop speculation | Arbitrum airdrop]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. Additionally, participating in protocols that do not yet have their own tokens might qualify users for future airdrops from those respective protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

The bridging week of the [[Arbitrum Odyssey program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] campaign officially concludes on June 27th at 13:00 Eastern Time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

## Week 1: Bridging Week Overview

The primary goal of Week 1, the bridging week, is to move Ethereum (ETH) to Arbitrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. To qualify for the [[NFT incentives from bridging on Arbitrum | NFT]], users must use a selected list of approved bridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

Key details for bridging:
*   **Asset Counted**: Only ETH is counted during the bridge rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
*   **Minimum Sum**: There is no minimum sum required to bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.
*   **Multiple Bridges**: Users are allowed to use multiple bridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

## Bridging Strategies for Airdrop Exposure

A key strategy for participating in the [[Arbitrum Odyssey program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] is to prioritize bridges that do not yet have their own native tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. The [[speculation_on_arbitrum_token_eligibility | speculation on Arbitrum token eligibility]] suggests that by using these tokenless bridges, users might also qualify for a future airdrop from the bridge protocol itself, effectively "killing two birds with one stone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

Examples of bridges without tokens identified include Lifi, Bungee, Hashflow, Hop, and Celer Network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. While gas fees are currently low, bridging too many times can still accumulate costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

## Bonus NFT for Popular Bridge Usage

An additional bonus [[NFT incentives from bridging on Arbitrum | NFT]] is awarded to users who bridge with the protocol that has the most wallet activations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. As of the video's recording, Hop was identified as the leading bridge by wallet activity, with Celer Network closely behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

## Additional Incentives from Bridges

Several bridges are offering their own incentives for users participating in the [[Arbitrum Odyssey program | Arbitrum Odyssey]]:

*   **Lifi**: Announced that they will be rewarding users who bridge with them, though specific details on these "retracted rewards" were not yet released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
*   **Hashflow**: Will issue a limited edition [[NFT incentives from bridging on Arbitrum | NFT]] that winners can redeem for Hashflow tokens upon launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. Hashflow also allows swapping any asset from any chain to ETH on Arbitrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. Winning criteria include the top 100 participants by total bridging volume and 100 randomly selected lucky participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
*   **Bungee**: To qualify for their additional incentive, users must be among the top 1,000 addresses with the highest token value bridged in a single transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. Bungee acts as an aggregator, pulling information to offer the highest return on swaps and transfers, and allows users to choose between highest return or lowest gas fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.
*   **Hop**: Will give a small brand [[NFT incentives from bridging on Arbitrum | NFT]] as a special gift to 10 lucky hoppers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

## Practical Considerations: Slippage

When [[bridging_to_arbitrum | bridging to Arbitrum]], it's important to consider not only gas fees but also slippage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. Some bridges may have higher slippage, resulting in receiving slightly less ETH than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. While Bungee (an aggregator) generally offers a slightly higher value by optimizing for returns, other bridges might have higher slippage, which should be noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.

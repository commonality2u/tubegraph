Holding Luna can provide opportunities to earn more Luna and receive special airdrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. These airdrops are received in addition to the Luna rewards earned through [[using_terra_luna_to_earn_more_luna | staking LUNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Prerequisite: Staking LUNA

To be eligible for certain [[airdrop_opportunities_during_the_campaign | airdrops]], it is often necessary to [[staking_luna_via_terra_wallet | stake LUNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

The process for [[staking_luna_via_terra_wallet | staking LUNA]] involves:
1.  Going to your Terra wallet and clicking on "staking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
2.  Selecting a validator from the list, which can be sorted by uptime, commission, or voting power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. There are 105 validators available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
    *   It is generally not recommended to stake with the top 5 validators to avoid concentrating power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
    *   Consider validators with 0% commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
    *   Prioritize validators with 100% uptime to ensure consistent earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
3.  Once a validator is chosen, click "delegate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
4.  Input the desired amount of Luna to stake and confirm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
After delegation, you can view a summary of your staked amount and earned rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

LlamaSwap, a product developed by DefiLlama, presents a compelling option for users looking to optimize their cryptocurrency swaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:43">[01:38:43]</a>. It serves as an effective method to avoid the additional 0.15% swap fee implemented by [[Uniswap swap fees | Uniswap]] for using their UI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## Key Advantages of LlamaSwap

### Aggregator of Aggregators
LlamaSwap functions as an "aggregator of all aggregators" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:47">[01:42:47]</a>. This includes integrating other major aggregators such as [[using_1inch_and_c_swap_for_costeffective_crypto_transactions | C Swap]] and [[using_1inch_and_c_swap_for_costeffective_crypto_transactions | 1inch]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:01">[01:45:01]</a>. By combining these services, LlamaSwap aims to provide users with the best possible rates across various platforms.

### No Additional Fees
A significant benefit of LlamaSwap is that it charges "no fees" for its service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:09">[01:49:09]</a>. This contrasts with the 0.15% UI fee imposed by [[Uniswap swap fees | Uniswap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

### Optimized Swap Rates
When selling one ETH, a user could receive 1575 USDT through LlamaSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:08">[01:47:08]</a>. This figure compares favorably to the 1569 USDT received through the [[Uniswap swap fees | Uniswap]] UI for the same transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>.

### Privacy Features
LlamaSwap offers a privacy feature that allows users to hide their IP address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:30">[01:51:30]</a>.

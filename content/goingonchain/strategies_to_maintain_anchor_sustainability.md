The [[interest_rates_and_yields_on_anchor | interest rate]] on [[anchor_protocol_business_model | Anchor]] is expected to decrease from its previous 19.5% due to a recently passed vote [00:00:03] [00:00:08] [00:00:13]. This change aims to make the [[anchor_protocol_business_model | Anchor]] protocol more sustainable [00:00:20] [00:00:24].

## Dynamic Earn Rate Implementation

A new vote has made the [[anchors_dynamic_earn_rates_and_yield_reserve_trends | earn rate]], or the [[interest_rates_and_yields_on_anchor | interest]] users make, dynamic [00:00:15] [00:00:17]. The adjustment formula for the [[interest_rates_and_yields_on_anchor | interest]] is based on the [[anchors_dynamic_earn_rates_and_yield_reserve_trends | yield reserve]]:
*   If the [[anchors_dynamic_earn_rates_and_yield_reserve_trends | yield reserve]] increases by 5%, the [[interest_rates_and_yields_on_anchor | interest]] will increase by 1.5% [00:00:30] [00:00:34].
*   If the [[anchors_dynamic_earn_rates_and_yield_reserve_trends | yield reserve]] drops by 5%, the [[interest_rates_and_yields_on_anchor | interest]] will drop by 1.5% [00:00:35] [00:00:38].
These adjustments are set to occur monthly [00:00:40] [00:00:42].

## Yield Reserve Trends and Challenges

Over the past 30 days, the [[anchors_dynamic_earn_rates_and_yield_reserve_trends | yield reserve]] has been on a downward trend [00:00:46] [00:00:52]. This decline is primarily due to an imbalance where more people are [[steps_to_deposit_ust_into_anchor | depositing]] than [[collateral_management_for_borrowing_on_anchor | borrowing]] on [[anchor_protocol_business_model | Anchor]] [00:00:52] [00:00:58].

## Strategies to Improve Sustainability

To address the imbalance and improve the [[anchors_dynamic_earn_rates_and_yield_reserve_trends | yield reserve]], [[anchor_protocol_business_model | Anchor]] plans to add more [[collateral_management_for_borrowing_on_anchor | collateral]] to the platform [00:01:02] [00:01:03] [00:01:05]. The goal is to encourage more users to [[collateral_management_for_borrowing_on_anchor | borrow]] UST [00:01:05] [00:01:12].

A recent example of this strategy is the addition of [[process_for_converting_avax_to_savax_and_using_in_anchor | AVAX]] as a supported [[collateral_management_for_borrowing_on_anchor | collateral]] option, allowing [[process_for_converting_avax_to_savax_and_using_in_anchor | AVAX]] users to [[collateral_management_for_borrowing_on_anchor | borrow]] UST on [[anchor_protocol_business_model | Anchor]] [00:01:10] [00:01:12]. However, adding new [[collateral_management_for_borrowing_on_anchor | collateral]] options is a process that takes time [00:01:19] [00:01:22].

Given the time required to implement new [[collateral_management_for_borrowing_on_anchor | collateral]] additions, it is anticipated that the [[interest_rates_and_yields_on_anchor | interest rate]] for [[anchor_protocol_business_model | Anchor]] will continue to decline in the coming months [00:01:24] [00:01:29] [00:01:31] [00:01:33]. Despite this, even with a potential decrease, the [[interest_rates_and_yields_on_anchor | interest rate]] is still expected to be significantly higher than those offered by traditional local banks [00:01:39] [00:01:41] [00:01:44] [00:01:47].

The [[speculations_about_an_arbitrum_airdrop | Arbitrum Odyssey]] is an eight-week campaign designed to encourage users to try out Arbitrum [00:00:45]. Participants who bridge during the designated "bridging week" are guaranteed to receive an NFT [00:01:13], with the potential for additional NFT rewards [00:01:24]. While the value of these NFTs is uncertain, there is significant speculation that participating in the Odyssey could be a criterion for a future Arbitrum airdrop [00:00:58].

Furthermore, many protocols featured in the Odyssey do not yet have their own tokens, leading to speculation that interacting with them might qualify users for airdrops from these respective protocols [00:01:02]. This is seen as a way to potentially receive "free money" [00:00:22], especially given the current low gas fees [00:00:20].

The campaign is scheduled to conclude on June 27, 1300 hours Eastern Time, which translates to June 28, 1 AM Singapore time [00:00:32].

## Arbitrum Odyssey: Bridging Week (Week 1)

The primary objective for Week 1 of the [[speculations_about_an_arbitrum_airdrop | Arbitrum Odyssey]] is to bridge ETH to Arbitrum [00:01:13]. To qualify for the associated NFT, users must utilize a specific list of approved bridges [00:01:18]. An extra bonus NFT is awarded to those who use the bridge that records the highest number of wallet activations [00:01:24].

Key details for bridging week:
*   **Assets Counted**: Only ETH is counted for bridging participation [00:01:40].
*   **Minimum Sum**: There is no minimum sum required to bridge [00:01:46].
*   **Multiple Bridges**: Users are permitted to use multiple bridges [00:01:48].

## Strategies for Potential Bridge Airdrops

A common strategy being discussed is to bridge using protocols that do not currently have their own native token [00:02:01]. The hypothesis is that by interacting with these token-less bridges, users might qualify for a future airdrop from the bridge protocol itself, effectively "killing two birds with one stone" [00:02:04].

Some of the bridges without existing tokens include:
*   Lifi [00:02:26]
*   Bungee [00:02:26]
*   Hashflow [00:02:26]
*   Hop [00:02:26]

While gas fees are generally low, the cumulative cost of using too many bridges can add up [00:02:21]. Users should also consider slippage, which can vary between bridges; for instance, "the bridge" (likely the Arbitrum native bridge) was noted to have higher slippage compared to aggregators like Bungee [00:04:55]. Bungee, as an aggregator, pulls information to offer the highest return, or allows users to choose the lowest gas fee [00:04:39].

### Bridges with Additional Incentives

Some bridges are offering extra incentives to encourage participation:

*   **Lifi**: Lifi has indicated they will be rewarding users who bridge with them, though specific details regarding these rewards are not yet fully released [00:03:07].
*   **Hashflow**: Hashflow is giving out a limited edition NFT. Winners can redeem this NFT for Hashflow tokens at launch [00:03:21]. The winning criteria include:
    *   100 participants with the highest total bridging volume [00:03:37].
    *   100 randomly selected lucky participants [00:03:40].
    *   Hashflow also allows swapping any asset from any chain to ETH on Arbitrum [00:03:30].
*   **Bungee**: To qualify for additional incentives from Bungee, users need to be among the top 1000 addresses with the highest token value bridged in a single transaction [00:03:54].
*   **Hop**: Hop is offering a special gift to 10 lucky "hoppers" who bridge with them: a small brand NFT [00:04:03].

### Top Bridges by Wallet Activation

For those aiming to secure the bonus NFT from the [[speculations_about_an_arbitrum_airdrop | Arbitrum Odyssey]] for using the bridge with the most wallet activations, Hop is currently observed to be leading, with Celer Network closely behind [00:02:50].

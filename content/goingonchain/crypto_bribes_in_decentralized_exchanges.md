## What are Crypto Bribes?
Traditional bribes are incentives often given "under the table" to influence actions, as long as one avoids getting caught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Crypto bribes, however, are different; they are open and transparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. For example, a protocol might openly tell a token holder to vote for them, offering a share of a "bribe" worth a significant amount, like 100,000 F-beats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

> [!INFO]
> A crypto bribe involves a protocol openly offering an incentive to holders of a [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | decentralized exchange (DEX)]] token to vote for their protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This incentivizes voters to direct their votes towards a specific protocol in exchange for a portion of the "bribe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## How Crypto Bribes Change the Game for DEXs
Historically, liquidity pool providers (LPs) and stakers would farm for [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | DEX]] tokens and often be ready to dump them at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Protocols seek high liquidity, and LPs help provide this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

With crypto bribes, the dynamic shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>:
*   [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | DEXs]] start to openly announce that a percentage of their token emission (e.g., 30%) will be distributed based on votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The protocol with the highest votes receives the largest portion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   Protocols actively compete for votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Winning votes allows them to increase the [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | DEX]] token reward for their pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   This increased reward attracts more liquidity providers to their pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   Participants may also buy the protocol's tokens to chase high Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This can help push up the price of the protocol's token, as seen with an example like "Sharp" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   Crucially, LPs become less willing to sell their [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | DEX]] tokens because they need them to vote, often for their own pools to help themselves win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Protocol Strategies for Winning Votes
Protocols can directly buy [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | DEX]] tokens, which adds buying pressure to the token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. However, continuously buying can push the [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | DEX]] token price too high and may not be sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

This is where crypto bribes become a key strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. A project can offer a significant amount (e.g., 100,000 VIS) to [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | DEX]] token holders to vote for their protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This attracts [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | DEX]] token holders from any pool, who can still receive a cut of the bribe for their vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### Alignment of Incentives and [[Impact of Crypto Bribes on DEX Token Value | Impact on Token Value]]
With crypto bribes, the incentives for various [[stakeholders_in_decentralized_exchanges | stakeholders]] become aligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>:
*   **Liquidity Providers (LPs) and Stakers**: They are incentivized to hold their [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | DEX]] tokens because they can use them to vote and earn more yield through the bribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. There is no reason for them to sell their [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | DEX]] tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Traders**: The high liquidity provided by LPs and the resulting low slippage attract traders to the [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | DEX]], leading to more trading fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Protocols**: They benefit from high liquidity for their pools and increased buying of their own tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **[[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | DEX]] Token**: The overall demand from holders wanting to participate in bribes and protocols wanting to secure votes creates continuous buying pressure on the [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | DEX]] token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Case Study: Beats
Before January of a recent year, the Beats [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | DEX]] token was consistently experiencing selling pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. However, starting on January 6th, Beats began offering bribes, dedicating 30% of their emission to this system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

This initiative gained traction as people started voting and desired more Beats tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Buying pressure consistently increased, and holders began to experience the benefits of the bribe system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. While selling pressure may not entirely disappear, the buying pressure created by the bribe mechanism is significantly strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Other Examples and Investment Considerations
Beyond Beats, SpiritSwap is another [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | DEX]] that utilizes crypto bribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. For instance, Greater DAO has engaged in bribe offerings with SpiritSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This system of aligned incentives provides a strong reason to hold [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | DEX]] tokens and participate in crypto bribes, which also adds buying pressure to the underlying protocol tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

When investing in [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | DEX]] tokens, it is advisable to look for projects that have this type of incentive setup where all [[stakeholders_in_decentralized_exchanges | stakeholders]] are aligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Without such alignment, a [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | DEX]] token may function merely as a farming token, prone to being dumped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

[[SnowdogDAO overview | SnowdogDAO]] is characterized as a "very degen" (degenerate) investment, initially offering extremely high Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) comparable to [[staking_on_snowbank | Snowbank]]'s early days [00:00:13]. The project's team remains anonymous, leading to concerns about a potential rug pull [00:01:49]. The project's high APY is deemed unsustainable [00:00:22].

> [!WARNING]
> This project is considered a very degen play due to its high risk and anonymous team [00:01:15]. The stated APY is not sustainable [00:00:22].

## Project Structure and Timeline

The anonymous team behind [[SnowdogDAO overview | SnowdogDAO]], which is also the same team that released [[staking_on_snowbank | Snowbank]], uses an [[differences_between_snowdogdao_and_olympusdao_forks | OlympusDAO fork]] method to raise capital for a memecoin [00:00:33]. The entire project is structured to operate over an 8-day period [00:00:39].

### Day 1 to Day 5: Minting Phase
During the first five days, users can mint S-DOG tokens, which leads to an increase in the total supply of S-DOG [00:00:44]. The vesting period for minted tokens is three days, which is shorter than the five-day vesting period observed in other projects like Wonderland [00:00:48]. This initial phase is very similar to the mechanics of [[differences_between_snowdogdao_and_olympusdao_forks | OlympusDAO]] [00:01:32].

### Day 5 Onwards: Redemption and Transformation
Starting from Day 5, the ability to mint S-DOG tokens ceases [00:00:57]. However, users can still redeem their previously minted tokens, especially if they minted on Day 4 and have not yet redeemed [00:01:01].

Day 8 is marked as a critical day for the project, anticipating significant price [[market_volatility_and_strategies_for_investing_in_snowdogdao | volatility]] [00:01:06]. On this day, all assets held by the project, excluding the liquidity pool, are converted into MIM (Magic Internet Money), a stablecoin [00:01:14]. This MIM is then used to buy S-DOG tokens from the S-DOG/MIM liquidity pool [00:01:16]. The purchased S-DOG tokens are subsequently burned, which reduces the overall supply [00:01:21]. Concurrently, staking rewards are paused [00:01:24]. Following this process, S-DOG will have a fixed supply and is intended to become the main currency for "Avec" [00:01:28]. After the 8-day period, S-DOG transforms into a memecoin [00:01:38].

## Investment Strategies and Risks

> [!INFO]
> The speaker mentions personally participating in the project to learn, attempting a strategy of redeeming and selling every few hours to recover capital [00:02:55].

For those engaging in "degen" plays, two main considerations exist [00:02:21]:
1.  **Minting with Highest Discount:** This involves utilizing the S-DOG/MIM Liquidity Pool (LP) [00:02:24]. For example, S-DOG might be minted at $2,000 when the market price is $5,400 [00:02:30].
2.  **Vesting and Post-Vesting Options:** The vesting term is three days [00:02:37]. Once vested, users can either claim and sell their tokens at the prevailing market price if favorable [00:02:41], or claim and auto-stake to benefit from the high APY [00:02:47].

> [!RISK]
> *   **Speed Required:** Projects of this nature necessitate a "fast in, fast out" approach [00:03:08].
> *   **New and Non-Standard:** SnowdogDAO is a new project and not a typical [[differences_between_snowdogdao_and_olympusdao_forks | OlympusDAO fork]] [00:03:10].
> *   **Anonymous Team:** The team's anonymity introduces significant risk [00:03:15].
> *   **Short Lifespan:** The entire degen play concludes after 8 days, after which the token becomes a memecoin [00:03:18].

It is advised that this is not financial advice, and users should conduct their own research [00:03:25].

While Web3 platforms like Trust Treaty offer solutions for freelancers, especially for remote work, there are inherent risks to consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:57">[03:51:57]</a>.

## Platform Risk
A significant concern is the [[platform_risk_and_security_concerns_with_finblox | platform risk]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:57">[03:53:57]</a>. If the platform goes away, the funding wallet, where payments are held in escrow, also becomes inaccessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:07">[03:55:07]</a>. This is because the keys to this secured wallet address are not held by the client or the service provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:07">[03:58:07]</a>.

## Dispute Resolution Bias
Another consideration is the potential for human bias in the [[dispute_resolution_in_web_3_freelance_contracts | dispute resolution]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:07">[04:05:07]</a>. Although dispute agents or operators are intended to make independent decisions, their assessments might still introduce human bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:07">[04:07:07]</a>.

The AnonMine project is one of three [[nfts_with_passive_income | NFTs designed to generate passive income]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

## Overview
The floor price for an AnonMine NFT is approximately 9 ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. Initially, there were 10,000 minted mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. A significant portion, 6,450, have been burned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>, leaving 3,550 mice remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. These remaining mice are unique as they are the only ones capable of breeding to produce new mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

## Cheese Production and Utility
The core of the AnonMine passive income strategy revolves around "cheese" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

### Earning Cheese
Holders can stake their AnonMine mice to earn cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. One staked mouse yields one cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. There is a maximum staking limit of 10 mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

### Acquiring Cheese
Besides staking, cheese can also be acquired through:
*   UniSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>
*   Private sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>

### Cheese Utility: Breeding New Mice
Cheese serves a crucial utility: breeding new mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. To produce a new mouse, two existing mice are required along with cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

**Important Breeding Conditions:**
*   The two original mice used for breeding are burned in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.
*   The newly produced mouse cannot be bred again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

## Considerations for Investors
Like the "banana" in [[cyber_kong_nft_and_its_banana_marketplace | Cyber Kong NFT and its banana marketplace]] and "honey" in [[bear_deluxe_nft_and_honey_utility | Bear Deluxe NFT and honey utility]], cheese has a defined use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. However, there is a possibility that these "farming tokens" could be subject to dumping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

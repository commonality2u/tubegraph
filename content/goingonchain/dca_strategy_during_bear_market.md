When the market experiences a bearish sentiment, such as a portfolio being down by approximately 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, employing a [[timing_the_market_versus_dollarcost_averaging | Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)]] strategy can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Benefits of DCA in a Bear Market

*   **Accumulation:** A bear market is considered the optimal time to accumulate assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Mitigating Risk:** Using the DCA strategy helps investors avoid "catching the falling knife," which refers to buying an asset during a sharp decline without knowing when it will bottom out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Application

The strategy involves continuously investing in strong projects, even while the market is down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Examples of projects mentioned for this strategy include Bitcoin (BTC), Fantom (FTM), and Merit Circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Considerations

It's important to note that crypto adoption continues to grow and there are no fundamental changes to the underlying technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. However, given the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency, it is always advised to only [[managing_crypto_investments_during_rapid_market_changes | invest money that one can afford to lose]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

Vader is a DeFi all-in-one protocol that incorporates elements from ThorChain and Luna to create its Automated Market Maker (AMM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. What makes Vader unique are the components it uses to ensure the AMM's success and maintain liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Vader Tokenomics

The tokenomics of Vader are structured around several key allocations and a dynamic relationship with its stablecoin, USDB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

### VE Holders (Early Investors)
Early investors in Vader are referred to as "ve holders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. These investors took their `ve` (which seems to be a form of Ethereum) and minted it into `vE` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. They then exchange their `vE` for Vader tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Allocation:** 50% of Vader tokens are given upfront, with the remaining 15% vested over one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

### Team Allocation
The team's allocation is 10% of the total supply, with a two-year linear vesting period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. The team remains anonymous, with the community lead identified as Dogs Mervin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Ecosystem and Liquidity Incentives
The remaining Vader tokens are allocated for ecosystem development and liquidity incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This includes the tokens used for bond sales, which originate from the Vader liquidity incentive pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### Vader and USDB Stablecoin Relationship
Vader's supply is directly linked to the supply of its stablecoin, USDB, which serves as the base asset for liquidity pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This mechanism is similar to how Luna and UST operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

*   **USDB above peg ( > $1 USD):** If USDB's value goes above $1 USD, Vader supply is burned to mint more USDB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This increases the supply of USDB, bringing its value back to peg, and simultaneously reduces Vader's supply, which can drive up Vader's price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **USDB below peg ( < $1 USD):** If USDB's value drops below $1 USD, USDB supply is burned to mint Vader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This lowers the supply of USDB, helping it return to peg, but also increases the supply of Vader, potentially causing Vader's price to drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

> [!info] Demand for USDB
> In essence, a higher demand for USDB positively impacts the price of Vader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This demand is driven by the AMM's requirement that liquidity providers pair assets with USDB, making USDB the base asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Bond Sales

Bond sales are a crucial component Vader utilizes to ensure liquidity remains within the protocol, addressing a common problem in AMMs where liquidity providers (LPs) "farm and dump" tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### Mechanism
Similar to Olympus Pro, Vader employs bond sales to acquire its own liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
1.  **LP Token Exchange:** LPs sell their liquidity pool tokens directly to the Vader protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
2.  **Discounted Vader:** In return, LPs receive Vader tokens at a discount, subject to a vesting period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Benefits
This strategy ensures that the protocol owns its liquidity pool tokens, guaranteeing that liquidity does not leave the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. The Vader tokens used for bond sales come from the community liquidity incentive allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

> Bond sales are conducted at fixed times and are not perpetual, meaning they are not always available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Vader recently conducted its first bond sale, which sold out within 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## Overall Impact
These components, including bond sales and the stablecoin mechanism, enable the Vader AMM to provide deep liquidity, offer impermanent loss protection for liquidity providers for 100 days, and create a stablecoin with pre-populated demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

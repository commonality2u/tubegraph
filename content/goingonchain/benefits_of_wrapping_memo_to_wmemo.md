Wonderland is placing significant emphasis on [[explanation_of_wmemo_in_wonderland | wMEMO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Wrapping staked TIME (MEMO) into [[explanation_of_wmemo_in_wonderland | wMEMO]] offers several advantages, allowing users to increase their yield and engage with other decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## What is wMEMO?

[[explanation_of_wmemo_in_wonderland | wMEMO]] is the wrapped version of staked TIME <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. It inherently includes both the price of TIME and all the rebases (interest) earned from staking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Key Benefits of wMEMO

Converting MEMO to [[explanation_of_wmemo_in_wonderland | wMEMO]] is recommended because it unlocks a variety of functionalities and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

### Integration with Abracadabra

Users can utilize [[how_to_use_wmemo_on_platforms_like_abracadabra_and_sushi | wMEMO on Abracadabra]] to borrow MIM stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This allows for further leveraged strategies within the DeFi ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### Liquidity Provision on SushiSwap

[[how_to_use_wmemo_on_platforms_like_abracadabra_and_sushi | wMEMO holders can become liquidity providers on SushiSwap]] by pairing their [[explanation_of_wmemo_in_wonderland | wMEMO]] with MIM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This enables earning fees from trading activity on the platform.

### Structured Products with Pendle

For those interested in structured products, [[explanation_of_wmemo_in_wonderland | wMEMO]] can be broken down into two components using the Pendle service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>:
*   **OTwMEMO (OT)**: Represents the time value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **YTwMEMO (YT)**: Represents the yield value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
This separation allows for advanced [[investment_strategies_for_wmemo_spell_and_ice | investment strategies]], such as selling YT and buying OT to lock in a specific yield if the Wonderland interest rate is expected to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Eligibility for Airdrops

Holding [[explanation_of_wmemo_in_wonderland | wMEMO]] makes users eligible for Wonderland airdrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This eligibility extends to [[eligibility_for_wonderland_airdrops_with_wmemo | wMEMO held on Avalanche, Ethereum, or Phantom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## How to Obtain wMEMO

If already staking on Wonderland, users can access a "wrap" function on the website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. By clicking "wrap," MEMO can be converted to [[explanation_of_wmemo_in_wonderland | wMEMO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The process can be reversed to unwrap [[explanation_of_wmemo_in_wonderland | wMEMO]] back to MEMO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

When wrapping, the quantity of [[explanation_of_wmemo_in_wonderland | wMEMO]] remains constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. However, the quantity of MEMO that can be unwrapped from the same amount of [[explanation_of_wmemo_in_wonderland | wMEMO]] increases over time, reflecting the included price and rebases (interest earned) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Tracking wMEMO Value

To [[tracking_the_value_of_wmemo | track the value of wMEMO]], users do not need to repeatedly wrap and unwrap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. There is a service called "The Bank" that allows users to see the value of their [[explanation_of_wmemo_in_wonderland | wMEMO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

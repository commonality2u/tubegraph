An arbitrage opportunity exists within the Nexus Protocol on the Terra blockchain, specifically utilizing its liquid Pylon pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This opportunity revolves around a 24-month locked pool where users deposit [[risks_and_benefits_of_investing_with_stablecoins | UST]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Overview of the Opportunity

When depositing [[risks_and_benefits_of_investing_with_stablecoins | UST]] into the 24-month liquid Pylon pool, investors receive [[gns_token_and_its_role_in_liquidity_and_tokenomics | Nexus tokens]] as a reward, currently yielding approximately 15.73% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. In addition to the rewards, the pool issues a receipt token called `bPSIDP` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This `bPSIDP` token represents the deposited [[risks_and_benefits_of_investing_with_stablecoins | UST]] and can be traded on TerraSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## The bPSIDP Token and De-peg

The liquid Pylon pool behaves similarly to a bond, meaning that if you deposit a certain amount, say $1,000, you are expected to receive that same amount back plus accumulated rewards after 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Currently, there is a "de-peg" issue with the `bPSIDP` token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This means the `bPSIDP` token trades at a significant discount relative to the [[risks_and_benefits_of_investing_with_stablecoins | UST]] it represents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. For example, $100 of [[risks_and_benefits_of_investing_with_stablecoins | UST]] might be able to purchase `bPSIDP` tokens that represent $128 of deposited [[risks_and_benefits_of_investing_with_stablecoins | UST]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This creates a de-peg of approximately 28-30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Arbitrage Strategies

Two main strategies can be employed to take advantage of this situation, both requiring a bullish outlook on the [[gns_token_and_its_role_in_liquidity_and_tokenomics | Nexus token]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>:

1.  **Short-Term De-peg Resolution:**
    *   Purchase `bPSIDP` tokens at their current discounted price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
    *   Wait for the de-peg to resolve, hoping the `bPSIDP` token price recovers closer to its peg (e.g., $128 `bPSIDP` purchased for $100 could eventually be worth $127 or $120) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
    *   Once the peg is restored, swap the `bPSIDP` back into [[risks_and_benefits_of_investing_with_stablecoins | UST]] to realize a profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

2.  **Long-Term 24-Month Hold:**
    *   If the de-peg does not resolve in the short term, hold the `bPSIDP` tokens for the full 24-month duration of the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
    *   After 24 months, the original deposited [[risks_and_benefits_of_investing_with_stablecoins | UST]] amount (e.g., $128 representing the principal for which you might have paid only $100) will be returned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
    *   During this 24-month waiting period, you will also continue to earn [[gns_token_and_its_role_in_liquidity_and_tokenomics | Nexus token]] rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This strategy heavily relies on being [[cryptocurrency_investment_approach | bullish]] on the [[gns_token_and_its_role_in_liquidity_and_tokenomics | Nexus token]]'s long-term value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Risks and Considerations

Several [[managing_risk_with_crypto_investments | risks]] are associated with this [[investing_in_cryptocurrency | investment]] strategy:

*   **De-peg Persistence:** There is a [[risks_and_considerations_in_defi_investments | risk]] that the `bPSIDP` de-peg might not resolve, meaning the short-term arbitrage strategy could fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Long Lock-up Period:** A 24-month waiting period is considered "very, very, very long" in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This exposes the [[crypto_portfolio_strategy | investment]] to significant market volatility and unforeseen changes within the Nexus Protocol or the broader Terra ecosystem.
*   **Reliance on Nexus Token Value:** Both strategies depend on being [[cryptocurrency_investment_approach | bullish]] on the [[gns_token_and_its_role_in_liquidity_and_tokenomics | Nexus token]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. If the value of the [[gns_token_and_its_role_in_liquidity_and_tokenomics | Nexus token]] depreciates significantly over 24 months, the overall returns may be negatively impacted, even with the de-peg resolution.
*   **Market Conditions:** The current de-peg is potentially influenced by a bearish market, where people might be selling assets, creating such discrepancies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. This indicates that market sentiment can directly affect the viability of this arbitrage.

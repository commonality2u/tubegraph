xDollar is a lending protocol that enables borrowing stablecoins with a low collateral ratio and zero percent interest [00:00:04]. The protocol has two versions, v1 and v2, with distinct characteristics and functionalities.

## Overview
Initially, xDollar v1 operated on Avalanche, Polygon, and Arbitrum [00:00:13]. The v2 version has since launched, starting on the Ethereum network, with plans to expand to Autochain [00:00:15]. Currently, xDollar v1 is undergoing a migration process [00:00:22].

## Naming Conventions
Following the launch of xDollar v2, certain naming conventions within the protocol changed:
*   **Stablecoin**: In v1, the stablecoin is known as xUSD [00:01:57]. In v2, it is called xIM, which stands for xDollar Intervals Money [00:02:00].
*   **Protocol Token**: The protocol token for v1 is named xTO [00:02:03]. For v2, the protocol token is called Space [00:02:06].

## Supported Blockchains and Features
The versions differ in the blockchains they support:
*   **xDollar v1**: This version works with Polygon, Avax (Avalanche), and Arbitrum [00:02:08].
*   **xDollar v2**: As of now, v2 is operational on Ethereum [00:02:11]. The team is actively working to onboard more Layer 2 solutions and protocols [00:02:13]. The aim for xDollar is to be [[multicollateral_and_multichain_features_of_xdollar | multi-chain]] and [[multicollateral_and_multichain_features_of_xdollar | multi-collateral]], allowing users to borrow stablecoins using assets like Matic, Avalanche, or Ethereum [00:01:04].

## Feature Demonstration
When demonstrating certain features like liquidation and redemption, xDollar v1 was used for illustration purposes [00:04:21].

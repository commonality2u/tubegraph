A common cryptocurrency scam involves promises of high returns through automated trading bots, specifically targeting [[pancakeswap_front_running_bot_scam | PancakeSwap]] transactions and resulting in the loss of BNB (Binance Coin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## How the Scam Works

This particular scam leverages a YouTube channel that claims to offer a script for creating a bot capable of "front-running" transactions on PancakeSwap, promising earnings of at least 10 BNB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The scam channel often appears legitimate, sometimes boasting 12,000 followers and numerous positive comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

Victims are encouraged to interact with the scammer, often through platforms like Discord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. When a small amount of BNB is tested with the bot, it predictably fails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The scammer then provides a "lame excuse," such as claiming that insufficient BNB was provided to trigger the front-running mechanism, and asks the victim to deposit more funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This tactic is a psychological trick, aiming to exploit the victim's desire to recover their initial capital and the promised earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

The underlying "code" provided by the scam triggers a call to an unknown wallet, meaning any funds sent via the script are redirected without the user's knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. It is advised not to blindly copy and paste code without understanding its function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Red Flags

Several clear indicators suggest that these operations are scams:
*   **Low Content, High Follower Count:** A channel with a significant number of followers (e.g., 2,000) but only one video is highly suspicious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Overly Positive Comments:** The comment sections are filled exclusively with positive feedback, with no negative reviews or expressions of doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. These are often fabricated.
*   **Request for More Funds:** After an initial small investment fails, the scammer asks for more money to "trigger" the promised returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This is a classic indicator of a scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Blind Code Execution:** The scam requires users to copy and paste code that sends funds to an unknown wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Users should always know where their money is being sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

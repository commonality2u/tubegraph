[[value_of_bitcoin | Bitcoin]] "can go to zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This is primarily because [[value_of_bitcoin | Bitcoin]] is "not backed up by any physical assets or any government body" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This characteristic makes it different from instruments like "US Treasury bonds of gold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

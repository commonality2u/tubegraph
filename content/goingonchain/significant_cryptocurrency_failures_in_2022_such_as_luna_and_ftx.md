The year 2022 was described as "down back" for cryptocurrency, with the overall market popularity dropping around 18% to 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This period was marked by significant failures, scams, and fraud, providing crucial [[key_takeaways_and_lessons_learned_in_crypto_investing | lessons learned]] for participants in the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Key Events and Failures of 2022

Several major events contributed to the challenging [[2022_crypto_market_downturn_and_key_events | 2022 crypto market downturn]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>:

*   **Wonderland Rock (January-February)**: The year began with the Wonderland Rock incident, which significantly impacted some investors who were drawn into the "Frog Nation narrative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Federal Reserve Interest Rate Hikes (March onwards)**: In March, the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates from 0.25% to 4.375% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This action halted the "money printers," led to the withdrawal of risk capital, and initiated a liquidity crisis in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **[[ust_and_luna_collapse | Fall of Luna]] (May)**: May saw the major [[ust_and_luna_collapse | collapse of Luna]], which was a particularly hard hit for many investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The failure of [[ust_and_luna_collapse | Luna]] triggered a "House of Cards" effect, leading to a chain reaction of failures across the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Celsius and Three Arrows Capital (3AC) Issues (June)**: In June, Celsius halted withdrawals, and Three Arrows Capital (3AC) faced liquidation, with ETH prices briefly falling below $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Ethereum Merge (September)**: While not a failure, September brought the significant Ethereum Merge, a major technological upgrade for the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **FTX Chapter 11 and Sam Bankman-Fried (SPF) Fraud (Late 2022)**: One of the latest major events was the filing of Chapter 11 bankruptcy by FTX and the subsequent allegations of fraud against its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried (SPF), who was later released on bail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## [[key_takeaways_and_lessons_learned_in_crypto_investing | Key Takeaways]] from the 2022 Downturn

Despite the challenges, continued participation in the crypto space demonstrates a strong belief in its potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The year provided crucial [[key_takeaways_and_lessons_learned_in_crypto_investing | lessons learned]]:

### Understanding Yield

> [!CAUTION]
> "If I do not understand the yield, where the yield is coming from, I am the yield." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>

During a bull market, it can be easier to assume an understanding of where yield originates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. However, incidents like Wonderland and [[ust_and_luna_collapse | Terra Luna]] revealed that this understanding was often flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. To make more informed decisions, it is crucial to acquire skills like Python and SQL to extract and analyze on-chain data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Relying solely on thought leaders is one thing, but observing their on-chain actions through tools like Nansen Scan can provide valuable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins

> [!WARNING]
> "Not your keys, not your coins." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>

Cases involving Celsius and FTX underscore the critical importance of [[importance_of_cryptocurrency_security | self-custody]] for assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. While centralized exchanges (CEX) like Binance and Crypto.com may still be used for on/off-ramping, it is advisable not to keep large sums of assets on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Assets should be quickly moved to personal wallets once acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Concerns regarding trust in CEXs also build a stronger case for decentralized finance (DeFi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

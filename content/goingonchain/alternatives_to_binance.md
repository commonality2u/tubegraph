Following the [[binance_ban_in_singapore | Binance ban]] in Singapore, users were given one month to withdraw their assets before exploring alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Impact of Binance's Announcement

On September 27, 2021, Binance announced several service restrictions for users in Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>:
*   No service to [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrency_on_binance | fiat deposit and withdrawal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   DBS Remit ceased to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   No more spot trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   No more liquid swaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Users were advised to exit all assets by October 26, 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. While customer service indicated that staking withdrawals (e.g., CAKE) might still be possible after this date, users concerned about their funds were advised to transfer coins to a Trust Wallet or [[metamask_alternatives_in_the_crypto_market | Metamask]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Futures trading was noted as a different service and reportedly not affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Comparing Alternative Exchanges

To identify suitable [[comparison_of_alternative_exchanges | alternative exchanges]], a poll was conducted among a community group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The comparison focused on three key components, using Binance as a benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>:
1.  **Liquidity**: Important for tighter spreads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. [[comparison_of_alternative_exchanges | Huobi]] and [[connections_between_finblox_and_other_platforms_like_binance_and_ftx | FTX]] were highlighted as having decent liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
2.  **Number of Coins**: For those interested in more unknown coins, [[comparison_of_alternative_exchanges | KuCoin]] came out on top, followed by [[comparison_of_alternative_exchanges | Huobi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
3.  **Fees**: For active traders performing multiple trades a day, trading fees are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. [[connections_between_finblox_and_other_platforms_like_binance_and_ftx | FTX]] offered the lowest fees, with an additional 3% discount for holding [[connections_between_finblox_and_other_platforms_like_binance_and_ftx | FTX]] tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Personal Workflow Example

One suggested workflow involves a mix of [[comparison_of_alternative_exchanges | Gemini]] and [[comparison_of_alternative_exchanges | KuCoin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>:
*   Use DBS Remit to deposit into [[comparison_of_alternative_exchanges | Gemini]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   Change funds to UST (a stablecoin) on [[comparison_of_alternative_exchanges | Gemini]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   Utilize [[comparison_of_alternative_exchanges | Gemini]]'s free withdrawal (10 times per month) to send UST to [[comparison_of_alternative_exchanges | KuCoin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   Purchase desired coins on [[comparison_of_alternative_exchanges | KuCoin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   For off-ramping:
    *   Sell assets and send to [[differences_between_binance_sg_and_binance_global | Binance SG]] to cash out via bank transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
    *   Alternatively, sell for UST and send to Anchor Protocol to earn yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   A [[comparison_of_alternative_exchanges | Huobi]] account is also kept as a standby for peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions in Singapore dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

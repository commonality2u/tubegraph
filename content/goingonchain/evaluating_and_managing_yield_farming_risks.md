[[yield_farming_and_growing_your_crypto | Yield farming]] presents opportunities for significant returns, but it's crucial to understand and manage the associated risks. The following insights are drawn from a personal experience with a new farm on the Fantom network. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>

## Case Study: [[yield_farming_on_geist_finance | Geist Finance]]

[[yield_farming_on_geist_finance | Geist Finance]] launched on the Fantom network on October 6th, quickly accumulating 3 billion TVL (Total Value Locked) in a single day. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a> It functions as a money market similar to Aave, allowing users to lend and borrow assets. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>

### Key Characteristics of Geist Finance

*   **Decentralized and Non-Custodial**: [[yield_farming_on_geist_finance | Geist Finance]] aims to differentiate itself by having no governance and no VCs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a> All revenue generated by the platform is distributed back to token holders and equity providers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>
*   **Anonymous Team with Multisig**: While the development team is anonymous, they have implemented a multisig (multi-signature) system for code changes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a> This requires 3 out of 5 high-profile individuals from the Fantom and DeFi industries (e.g., Fantom Foundation, SpookySwap, DeFi Llama) to sign off on changes, mitigating [[risk_management_in_stablecoin_farming | rug pull]] concerns. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a> Additionally, there's a 2-day time lock delay on any proposed changes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a> The team is also transparent in their Telegram group. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>
*   **Reward Structure**:
    *   Users earn Geist tokens for lending and borrowing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>
    *   Providing liquidity to the Geist-FTM pool also yields Geist token rewards. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>
    *   Airdrops are given for supplying on Curve. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>
    *   **Penalty for Early Exit**: To discourage immediate dumping of rewards, a 50% penalty is applied if rewards are claimed and not held for at least 90 days. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>
    *   **Locking Rewards**: Users can choose to lock their Geist tokens for three months, which allows them to earn platform fees and penalty fees, but this option prevents early exit. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>

## Evaluating Risks: A Personal Experience with Geist Finance

The speaker initially jumped into the Geist-FTM liquidity pool when the APY was exceptionally high, around 10,000%. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a> An initial investment of approximately $2,800, split between USDT and FTM, was made. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>

### The "Triple Hit" Scenario

The main pitfall encountered was a "triple hit" combination of factors leading to significant losses:

1.  **Declining Price of the Farm Token (Geist)**: The price of Geist dropped from $8 to $1.95, severely impacting the value of earned rewards. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>
2.  **Decreasing APY**: As more participants joined the farm, the APY naturally decreased, slowing down the rate of token generation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>
3.  **Decline in Liquidity Pool Value**: Since the pool consisted of Geist and FTM, and both asset prices fell, the overall value of the provided liquidity significantly decreased. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>

This combination resulted in a 20% loss on the initial investment, making daily earnings from the pool very small. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>

### Capital Flight Speed

Another unexpected factor was the rapid speed of capital flight from the platform. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a> Unlike earlier periods where capital might take time to bridge between networks (e.g., Polygon to Avalanche), money can now move "super fast" between opportunities, as seen when capital quickly flowed from Fantom to Harmony for new liquidity mining programs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a> This rapid movement was observed on platforms like DefiLlama, showing how quickly TVL can taper down in a farm. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>

## [[strategies_and_mistakes_in_yield_farming | Strategies and Mistakes in Yield Farming]]

### Mistakes Made

The experience highlighted several key mistakes in [[strategies_and_mistakes_in_yield_farming | yield farming]]:

*   **Chasing High APY**: While tempting, jumping into a farm solely because of an extremely high APY at launch might not be wise. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>
*   **Buying Farm Tokens**: A common rule from experienced [[yield_farming_and_growing_your_crypto | yield farmers]] (e.g., YouTube channel "So Tacky") is not to buy the farm token directly. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a> The speaker broke this rule by buying Geist tokens to add to the liquidity pool. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>
*   **Ignoring Triple Hit Risk**: Not fully accounting for the combined risk of declining farm token price, decreasing APY, and falling liquidity pool value. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>
*   **Lack of Constant Monitoring**: For volatile liquidity pools involving non-stable assets, constant monitoring is essential. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>

### Alternative Strategies and Considerations

*   **[[stablecoin_leveraged_yield_farming | Stablecoin Yield Farming]]**: Using [[stablecoin_leveraged_yield_farming | stablecoins]] (e.g., USDT, DAI, USDC) for [[yield_farming_and_growing_your_crypto | yield farming]] mitigates exposure to asset price volatility, as stablecoins are pegged to $1. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a> However, this approach typically yields lower APYs and requires significant capital (e.g., five-figure investments like $20k-$30k) to generate substantial passive income. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>
*   **DeFi Degen (Degenerate) Farming**: Entering high-APY, volatile pools can be considered "degen" farming due to the high risk. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>
*   **Leveraged Strategies**: Some users borrow assets (e.g., Fantom) using collateral (e.g., Ethereum) to then deposit into liquidity pools, but this introduces additional complexity and liquidation risks. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>

## Managing Ongoing Risk

Despite current losses, the speaker plans to continue participating in [[yield_farming_on_geist_finance | Geist Finance]] by vesting rewards and locking them for three months. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a> This strategy aims to earn platform fees and penalty fees, betting on the platform's long-term potential given its position as the second-highest TVL protocol on Fantom. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a> The maximum acceptable loss is set at $1,500. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>

> [!CAUTION] Lessons Learned
> *   High APYs in new farms can be a trap.
> *   Avoid buying the farm's native token for liquidity provision.
> *   Be aware of the "triple hit" risk (falling token price, falling APY, falling LP value).
> *   Capital flows very quickly in DeFi; constant monitoring is crucial for volatile assets.
> *   [[stablecoin_leveraged_yield_farming | Stablecoin farming]] offers less risk but requires more capital for significant returns.

Overall, [[understanding_the_sources_of_crypto_yield_and_associated_risks | understanding the sources of crypto yield and associated risks]] is paramount. While the allure of high APYs is strong, a cautious approach, diligent monitoring, and a clear [[risk_management_in_stablecoin_farming | risk management]] strategy are essential for navigating the volatile world of [[yield_farming_and_growing_your_crypto | yield farming]].

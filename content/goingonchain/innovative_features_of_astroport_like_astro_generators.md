Astroport is an upcoming [[overview_of_astroport_as_an_amm_on_terra | AMM]] on [[using_terra_luna_to_earn_more_luna | Terra]] that aims to enhance the decentralized exchange experience beyond what is currently available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. While [[comparison_between_astroport_and_terraswap | Terraswap]] was built primarily to support the Miro protocol and serves a basic need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>, Astroport is designed to be a full-fledged [[overview_of_astroport_as_an_amm_on_terra | AMM]] offering significant improvements and innovative features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.

## Why Terra Needs Another AMM
Traditional [[overview_of_astroport_as_an_amm_on_terra | AMMs]] often have limitations that Astroport seeks to address:
*   **Limited Functionality of Existing AMMs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>: Current platforms like [[comparison_between_astroport_and_terraswap | Terraswap]] provide very basic functionality, lacking features such as charts or APY displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.
*   **Single Pool Type Limitation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>: Traditional [[overview_of_astroport_as_an_amm_on_terra | AMMs]] commonly utilize only one product pool type, the constant product formula, which is suitable for high-volatility pairs like Bitcoin and Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>. However, this model results in poor slippage for stablecoin pools or new token launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>.
*   **Loss of Native Protocol Benefits** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>: Providing liquidity on platforms like [[comparison_between_astroport_and_terraswap | Terraswap]] can cause users to lose out on benefits offered by the native protocols, such as rewards from [[sustainability_of_anchor_platform | Anchor]] for ANC-UST liquidity provision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>.

## Innovative Features of Astroport
Astroport aims to solve these issues by introducing several key innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:55">[01:10:55]</a>:

### Enhanced User Interface and Experience
Astroport intends to provide a superior UI/UX experience compared to a simple swap screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:46">[01:13:46]</a>. This includes displaying chart trends and offering a more user-friendly interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>.

### Multiple Liquidity Pool Types
Instead of a single constant product pool, Astroport will offer three different types of pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:46">[01:21:46]</a>. The primary goal of these varied pools is to benefit users by providing better exchange rates and reducing slippage, particularly for stablecoin pairs and newly launched tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:46">[01:23:46]</a>.

### Astro Generators (Double Farming)
One of Astroport's most powerful features is "Astro Generators" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:13">[01:29:13]</a>. This feature enables "double farming," meaning users can earn rewards from Astroport while simultaneously receiving benefits from the native protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>. For example, if a user provides ANC-UST liquidity to Astro Generators, a proxy smart contract ties the liquidity to [[sustainability_of_anchor_platform | Anchor]], allowing the user to earn both Astroport tokens and [[sustainability_of_anchor_platform | Anchor]] benefits simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:04">[01:32:04]</a>.

### Development Team
Astroport is developed by a joint venture comprised of groups such as Delphi Digital, IDO, and TFL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:09">[01:49:09]</a>.

## Tokenomics and Launch
Astroport's [[tokenomics_and_distribution_for_astroport | token breakdown]] allocates 55% of tokens to liquidity pool providers over four years, while the team and investors receive 30% over three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:05">[01:56:05]</a>. Additionally, there will be two sub-tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:05">[02:06:05]</a>.

Astroport is undergoing auditing and is expected to launch around mid-November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:56">[02:09:56]</a>. Instead of an [[astroport_launch_details_and_token_drop_strategy | IDO]], Astroport will have a [[astroport_launch_details_and_token_drop_strategy | token drop]] distributed in three phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:36">[02:13:36]</a>:
1.  Participation in DeFi on [[using_terra_luna_to_earn_more_luna | Terra]]: Users involved in farming activities on [[using_terra_luna_to_earn_more_luna | Terra]] will receive tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:03">[02:18:03]</a>.
2.  Liquidity Provision on [[comparison_between_astroport_and_terraswap | Terraswap]]: Users who migrate their liquidity from [[comparison_between_astroport_and_terraswap | Terraswap]] to Astroport will be rewarded with tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:13">[02:28:13]</a>.
3.  Commitment to Astroport UST Pool: Tokens earned from the first two phases can be committed to the Astroport UST pool to earn even more tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:48">[02:35:48]</a>. The second and third phases will include a lockup period, similar to Pylon Protocol's vesting period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:03">[02:45:03]</a>.

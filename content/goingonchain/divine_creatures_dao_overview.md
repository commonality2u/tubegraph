Divine Creatures DAO (DC DAO) is an upcoming project that operates as an Olympus DAO fork with a unique twist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The application for DC DAO has not yet launched, so the information available is a preview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Core Concept: Treasury of Treasuries

The primary objective of DC DAO is to establish itself as a "treasury of treasuries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. To achieve this, the DAO aims to accumulate various assets from other prominent Ohm-fork projects, such as wMEMO, OHM, and MIN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## The EGS Token and OHM Fork Mechanics

Similar to other OHM forks, users can bond their EGS tokens to mint them at a discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. These tokens can then be staked to earn interest, much like Wonderland or OHM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. In its initial phase, DC DAO is targeting an Annual Percentage Yield (APY) of 50,000% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The bonding process allows DC DAO to build its treasury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## The Unique Dex Mechanism

The interesting twist of DC DAO lies in its plan to build a decentralized exchange (DEX) populated with assets from its treasury, including wMEMO, OHM, Hector, and Exodia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This DEX will enable users to swap tokens in a timed sequence:
*   After a rebase, EGS tokens can be swapped for wMEMO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   At 1 PM, users can swap for OHM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   At 2 PM, they can swap for Hector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

The team has projected that users could potentially make about 3.78% in profit from one complete cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Completing this cycle three times a day could yield approximately 11.34% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. While currently a manual process, the team is exploring ways to automate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Users have the flexibility to choose specific swaps, such as EGS to wMEMO or OHM, and then wait for EGS again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Although similar strategies exist, the DC DAO DEX aims to provide deep liquidity to minimize slippage, which is a common issue when performing these swaps across multiple platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Revenue Model

Swap fees generated on the DEX will be directed into the treasury, serving as revenue for the DAO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This revenue stream could help sustain the high APY offered to EGS stakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

# Initial NFT Offering (INO) Launch

DC DAO plans an "Initial NFT Offering" (INO) for its launch, a distinct approach compared to other OHM forks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Participation requires purchasing an NFT through an auction to receive a token allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## NFT Tiers and Benefits

There are three tiers of NFTs:
*   **God Tier**: The highest tier, with a starting bid of 4200 FTM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Dante Tier** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>
*   **Damning God** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>

NFT holders receive several benefits:
*   **Token Allocation**: For example, a Dante tier NFT purchased at 500 FTM could grant an allocation of up to 600 FTM worth of EGS tokens at pre-sale prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Special Boosts**: Holding a Dante tier NFT provides a 2.5% staking boost and a 5% bonding boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Lottery**: NFTs also come with a lottery component; for instance, a "Bronze Dante" NFT could yield an additional 25% allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

# Tokenomics and Team

## Token Distribution

In the Initial NFT Offering, 80% of the token supply will be distributed through the NFT auction, ensuring a broad public distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The team retains 10% of the tokens, and another 10% is allocated for initial liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

The vesting period for the team's tokens is six months, with a two-month cliff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. However, this period is considered relatively short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Team Details

The team behind DC DAO is anonymous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. They claim to have diverse experience, including backgrounds in banking, science, and law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. DC DAO has also formed a partnership with SpiritSwap, with one of SpiritSwap's members serving as a multi-sig signer for DC DAO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

# Overall Thoughts

DC DAO presents an interesting concept, particularly for users interested in yield farming and rebasing mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. The distribution of 80% of tokens to the public via NFT sales is a positive aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. While the NFT benefits, such as allocation bonuses and staking/bonding boosts, are appealing, greater utility for the NFTs themselves would be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Concerns remain regarding the anonymous nature of the team and the relatively short vesting period for their tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

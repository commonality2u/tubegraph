The [[arbitrum_odyssey_bridging_strategies | Arbitrum Odyssey]] is an eight-week campaign designed to encourage users to try out Arbitrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Participants are rewarded with an NFT for bridging assets during the first week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Beyond the guaranteed [[nft_incentives_from_bridging_on_arbitrum | NFT incentives from bridging on Arbitrum]], there's a strong speculation that using certain bridges could also qualify users for potential future airdrops from those protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This strategy aims to potentially "kill two birds with one stone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Why Bridges Without Tokens?

The core idea is to focus on bridges that have not yet launched their own native tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. By interacting with these protocols, users might qualify for an airdrop if and when these bridges decide to launch a token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This is considered a potential source of "free money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, although it remains a speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

For the first week of the [[arbitrum_odyssey_bridging_strategies | Arbitrum Odyssey]], known as Bridging Week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, the objective is to [[bridging_to_arbitrum | move ETH to Arbitrum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Only a selected list of bridges qualify for the NFT reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The asset counted for bridging is ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, and there is no minimum sum required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Users can also use multiple bridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Specific Bridges to Consider

Based on analysis, the following bridges are highlighted as not yet having tokens, making them candidates for potential future airdrops if used for [[bridging_to_arbitrum | bridging to Arbitrum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>:

*   **Li.Fi** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>
*   **Bungee** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>
*   **Hashflow** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>
*   **The Bridge (Official)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>

## [[additional_incentives_from_specific_bridges | Additional Incentives from Specific Bridges]]

Some of these bridges are offering further incentives for users who bridge with them:

### Li.Fi
Li.Fi has indicated they will be rewarding users who bridge with them, though specific details on these rewards are not yet available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Hashflow
Hashflow is giving out a limited edition NFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a> that winners can redeem for their token upon launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The winning criteria include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>:
*   100 participants with the highest total volume bridged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   100 randomly selected lucky participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
Hashflow also allows swapping any asset from any chain to ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### The Bridge
To qualify for additional incentives from The Bridge, users need to be among the top 1000 addresses with the highest token value bridged in a single transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### [[using_hop_exchange_for_bridging | Hop Exchange]]
While [[using_hop_exchange_for_bridging | Hop Exchange]] is leading in wallet activation for the bonus NFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, 10 lucky "hoppers" will receive a small brand NFT as a special gift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Considerations for Bridging

When bridging, beyond gas fees, it's crucial to consider slippage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Some bridges, like The Bridge, might have higher slippage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Aggregators like Bungee can help by pulling in information from various sources to find the highest return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, or users can select based on the lowest gas fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

Remember, this is not financial advice, and [[airdrop_opportunities_during_the_campaign | airdrop opportunities during the campaign]] remain speculative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

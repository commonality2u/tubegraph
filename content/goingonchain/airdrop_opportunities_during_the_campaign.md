The Arbitrum Odyssey is an eight-week campaign designed to encourage users to try out Arbitrum, offering NFTs in return for participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. While obtaining an NFT is a definite outcome of bridging during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, the primary interest for many participants revolves around potential [[Arbitrum airdrop speculation | airdrop speculation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. [[Arbitrum airdrop speculation | Airdrops]] are considered potential free money, especially with current low gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Campaign End Date
The Arbitrum Odyssey campaign concludes on June 27 at 13:00 Eastern Time, which is June 28 at 1:00 AM Singapore time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Potential Airdrop Criteria
The speculation is that the NFTs earned from participation might serve as a criterion for a future [[Arbitrum airdrop speculation | airdrop]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Furthermore, some of the projects participating in the Odyssey do not yet have their own tokens. Engaging with these protocols during the campaign could potentially qualify users for future [[Arbitrum airdrop speculation | airdrops]] from the respective projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Week 1: Bridging Week
The first week of the Odyssey is dedicated to bridging, with the goal of moving ETH to Arbitrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. To qualify for the NFT, participants must use a selected list of bridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### Bridging Requirements
*   **Asset**: The asset counted for bridging is ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Minimum Sum**: There is no minimum sum required to bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Multiple Bridges**: Users are allowed to use multiple bridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Maximizing Airdrop Exposure: Selecting Bridges
To increase the chances of receiving additional [[Arbitrum airdrop speculation | airdrops]], a strategy involves using bridges that do not currently have their own tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The reasoning is that by using these bridges, users might also qualify for a future [[Arbitrum airdrop speculation | airdrop]] from the bridge protocol itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Recommended Bridges Without Tokens
Based on research, the following four bridges are recommended for potential additional [[Arbitrum airdrop speculation | airdrops]] if they launch tokens:
*   Lifi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>
*   Bungee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>
*   Hashflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>
*   Another unnamed bridge from the list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a> (Implied from the speaker's own filtered list)

### Bonus NFT for Highest Wallet Activation
An extra bonus NFT is awarded to participants who use the bridge with the most wallet activations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. As of the time of the video, Hop was leading in wallet activations, with Celer Network close behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Additional Bridge Incentives
Some bridges offer their own additional incentives to users who bridge through them:

*   **Lifi**: Lifi has stated they will be rewarding people who bridge with them, though specific details on these "retracted rewards" were not yet out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Hashflow**: Hashflow is giving out a limited edition NFT that winners can redeem for their token at launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Users can swap any asset from any chain to ETH or Arbitrum. The winning criteria include the top 100 participants by highest total volume and 100 randomly selected lucky prize winners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Bungee**: To qualify for Bungee's additional incentive, users need to be among the top 1,000 addresses with the highest token value bridged in a single transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Bungee acts as an aggregator, selecting the route with the highest return for the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Hop**: Ten lucky "hoppers" who bridge with Hop will receive a small brand NFT as a special gift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

## Bridging Considerations
When bridging, beyond gas fees, users should also consider slippage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Some bridges may have higher slippage, impacting the final amount received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

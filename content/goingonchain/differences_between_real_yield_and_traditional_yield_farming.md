[[Real Yield in DeFi | Real Yield]] is a new narrative in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It stands in contrast to the traditional [[Yield farming and growing your crypto | yield farming]] methods that were common in earlier days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Traditional Yield Farming

The "good old farming days" often featured very high Annual Percentage Rates (APRs), sometimes exceeding 10,000% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This model was often described as "ponzu" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

Key characteristics included:
*   **Reward Mechanism** Users would buy the platform's native token, lock it (stake), and earn more of the same platform tokens as rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Token Inflation** The tokens earned were often rushed to be sold by users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, leading to significant token inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Emissions** Emissions, or the distribution of new tokens, were often treated as expenses used to attract users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Real Yield

[[Real Yield in DeFi | Real Yield]] offers rewards in a different format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Instead of receiving more of the protocol's native token, holders receive a cut of the revenue generated when users engage with the protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. These rewards are typically distributed in mainstream assets, such as Ethereum (ETH) or stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

Examples of protocols offering [[Real Yield in DeFi | Real Yield]]:
*   **GMX** Staking GMX earns both GMX and ETH rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **GNS** Staking GNS earns 4% in DAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **Umami** Depositing Umami earns ETH rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Kujira** Staking Kujira (which is now its own chain) allows users to collect rewards in various asset types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Valuation Models for Real Yield Protocols

Common valuation models for [[Real Yield in DeFi | Real Yield]] protocols, often seen on Twitter, compare various metrics to assess how protocols are generating revenues and fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

The typical process involves:
1.  **Volume and Fee Generation** Analyzing the volume to determine the fees generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
2.  **Ratio and P/E Estimation** Calculating a ratio and estimating the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
3.  **Undervaluation Assessment** Using the P/E ratio to assess if a platform is undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Tools for Data Collection

Several tools can assist in gathering the necessary numbers for these valuations:
*   **Token Terminal** A platform for data aggregation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Dune** Features informative dashboards built by "smart gigachats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Protocol Statistic Pages** Many protocols host their own statistic pages providing relevant information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

### Important Considerations for Valuation

When performing valuations, several factors should be noted:
*   **Supply Figures** The choice between using circulating supply versus total supply can significantly alter results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Emissions as Expenses** Emissions (new tokens) can be considered expenses, as they are used to attract users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Blockchain Chain and User Migration** The underlying blockchain chain is crucial. For instance, if a protocol like dydx moves to Cosmos, the likelihood of users following them must be considered due to changes in security (moving from ETH) and requiring different wallets and interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

There is no single "right or wrong" valuation model; it depends on how one chooses to construct it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

Hundred Finance, a multi-chain platform similar to Compound, enables users to earn [[yield_farming_to_grow_cryptocurrency | yield]] through various strategies involving the supply of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The core usage of Hundred Finance is lending and borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The platform is currently active on several networks, including the Fantom network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

### Methods for Earning Yield by Supplying Assets

1.  **Supplying Assets and Borrowing Stablecoins**
    This strategy involves supplying a crypto asset as collateral, then borrowing a stablecoin, and subsequently supplying that stablecoin back into Hundred Finance to earn [[yield_farming_to_grow_cryptocurrency | yield]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
    *   **Example:** Supply ETH as collateral, borrow MIM, then supply and stake the MIM back into Hundred Finance to earn an 11.11% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
    *   **Staking Reward:** The staking reward for MIM is paid in HND tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
    *   **Yield Boost:** The [[yield_farming_to_grow_cryptocurrency | yield]] can be boosted by purchasing and locking HND tokens, which provides `veHND` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
        *   Users can vote on gauges with `veHND` to direct emissions and receive a boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
        *   The maximum boost achievable is 2.5x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. For instance, locking 300 HND for four years with $3,000 staked can achieve a 2.5x boost, while locking for one year yields a 1.46x boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. A boost calculator is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

2.  **Participating in Backstop Provision**
    Instead of directly lending out USDC, users can contribute to the backstop provision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This involves providing liquidity that the platform can use to execute liquidations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
    *   **Yield:** Providing USDC to the backstop typically yields an approximate 8.79% eAPR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

3.  **Leveraging Long or Short Positions**
    Hundred Finance allows users to leverage long or short positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
    *   **Leverage Long:** Supply a crypto asset, borrow a stablecoin, then use the stablecoin to buy more of the desired asset to long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. For example, supplying ETH, borrowing USDC, and then buying more ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. When the asset's price rises, selling a portion allows repayment of the loan and profit from the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
    *   **Leverage Short:** Supply a stablecoin or crypto asset, borrow the crypto asset to short, and then sell the borrowed asset for a stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. For example, supplying ETH to short BTC involves borrowing BTC, swapping it for a stablecoin on a DEX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. When the asset's price drops, the stablecoins can be used to buy back the asset at a lower price and repay the loan, earning the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Hundred Finance provides documentation and number examples for these strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

4.  **Providing Liquidity**
    Users can provide liquidity to pools on platforms like Bits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
    *   **Example:** Providing liquidity to a pool that is proportioned as 60% HND, 20% FTM, and 20% USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
    *   **Yield:** The combined APR for this specific liquidity provision can be as high as 110% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

5.  **Using LENDY**
    LENDY is a specific deployment by Hundred Finance where the team borrows USDC from users, using HND as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This allows the team to provide liquidity on pools like `HND/WFTM` in Solidly to receive `SOLID` emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
    *   **Yield:** Providing USDC to the LENDY deployment can earn approximately 34.25% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
    *   **Withdrawal:** Rewards can be claimed under the "stake" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This is considered a good [[real_yield_in_defi | yield]] for [[using_stablecoins_in_yield_farming | stablecoins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

These diverse strategies highlight the power of [[decentralized_finance_and_yield_reserves | DeFi]] in enabling users to generate [[yield_optimization_and_decentralized_finance_defi | yield]] from their assets on platforms like Hundred Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

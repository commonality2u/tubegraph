From: [[goingonchain]] <br/> 

The primary concern identified with Finblox is platform risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This refers to the inherent risks associated with using a particular platform, including operational stability, security vulnerabilities, and regulatory standing.

## Newness of the Platform

Finblox is considered a relatively new platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Its recent emergence means it may not have the same established track record or regulatory scrutiny as more mature platforms.

## Regulatory Status and KYC Policy

Unlike [[comparison_between_finblox_and_hodlnaut | Hodlnaut]], which had received "in principle approval" suggesting some vetting by regulators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, Finblox's regulatory status is not specified in the transcript.

Furthermore, upon initial sign-up, there was no Know Your Customer (KYC) process required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. The absence of KYC could indicate a lower level of regulatory compliance or different operational policies compared to platforms that prioritize these measures.

> [!CAUTION]
> The biggest risk identified for Finblox is platform risk, especially given its newness and the absence of KYC during the sign-up process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

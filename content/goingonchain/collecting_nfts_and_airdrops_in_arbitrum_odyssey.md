From: [[goingonchain]] <br/> 

The [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] campaign experienced a pause during what was supposed to be Week 2 due to a significant surge in gas fees on the Arbitrum network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This surge led to swap fees as high as $21, which is unusually high for an L2 solution designed for cheaper transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The campaign is set to resume once Arbitrum launches Nitro, an accelerated version intended to reduce network load and gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Collecting Odyssey NFTs

Participants who have completed the initial [[bridging_process_and_options_for_arbitrum | bridging process]] to Arbitrum are now eligible to collect their associated NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### Bonus NFTs from Hop Protocol

For those who bridged using Hop Protocol, which recorded the highest volume during the [[overview_of_arbitrum_odyssey_program | Odyssey]] campaign, there are bonus NFTs available. Participants should check Hop's Discord channel for instructions on how to collect these bonus NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Additionally, Hop Protocol announced winners for a small NFT giveaway. Users who bridged with Hop should verify if their address is among the 10 selected winners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Potential Airdrops

Beyond NFTs, the completion of tasks within the [[arbitrum_odyssey_campaign_overview | Arbitrum Odyssey]] campaign could also make participants eligible for possible [[speculations_about_an_arbitrum_airdrop | Arbitrum airdrops]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. The [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] will continue to be a crucial factor for [[eligibility_for_arbitrum_airdrop | potential future Arbitrum airdrops]].

## Overview of Paused Week 2 Protocols

While the [[arbitrum_odyssey_week_2_overview | Arbitrum Odyssey Week 2]] was paused, the intended [[protocols_and_tasks_for_arbitrum_odyssey_week_2 | protocols and tasks]] were:

Tangible is a marketplace designed to convert real-world assets into non-fungible tokens (NFTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This platform represents a move towards increased crypto adoption for [[tangible_asset_purchases_using_cryptocurrency | tangible asset purchases]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## How Tangible Operates

When a purchase is made on Tangible, a T-NFT is minted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The physical item is securely stored in a vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Users have the option to take physical delivery of their item at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Fees and Revenue Distribution

Tangible charges a storage fee for high-value items kept in the vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. For items acquired from another seller, a platform fee of 2.5% is applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This 2.5% fee is distributed as follows:
*   33% is used to buy and burn Tangible tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   66.66% goes to Tangible stakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Supported Tangible Assets

Tangible supports the purchase of physical assets such as gold bars and watches using USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Real Estate Tokenization

Another significant real asset available on Tangible is real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Through [[NFT and tokenization | tokenization]], users can acquire a fraction of a property or purchase all fractions to own the entire real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The focus for real estate acquisitions is on capital and rental yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

For instance, a property might generate a rent of $494 per month, with a net yield of approximately 15.17%, which includes both capital appreciation and rental yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. It's important to note that the yield will account for management and other fees, as Tangible handles legal, maintenance, and paperwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

There is a minimum fraction required for purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, and rental yield only begins once all property fractions have been sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## USDR Stablecoin

Tangible also backs a stablecoin called USDR, which is over-collateralized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. USDR's backing includes a mix of real estate assets, Tangible tokens, DAI, and protocol-owned liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

Learnings from the UST incident (referring to [[Terra NFT projects | Terra]]) have influenced Tangible's approach to ensure USDR does not fall into a death spiral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. They ensure that at least 88% of other assets are used for collateral before their native token can be used to mint USDR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

Currently, USDR offers a yield of 4.25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Tangible plans to subsidize this yield to push it to a range of six to nine percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Tangible Tokens

Tangible tokens have several uses:
*   They can be used for minting USDR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   They receive revenue from product sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Tangible applies a ve (vote-escrowed) concept for its tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. When users stake and lock their tokens, they can convert them into an NFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. The longer the tokens are locked, the higher the rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. If a user wishes to exit, they can sell their NFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

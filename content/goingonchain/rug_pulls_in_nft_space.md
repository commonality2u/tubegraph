The NFT season on Terra has seen a surge in activity and new projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. While many projects are launching, such as [[galaxy_punk_nft_prices | Galaxy Punk]] which is fetching good prices on the secondary market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, the booming market also attracts scammers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Two notable incidents highlight the risks associated with the rapid growth of [[terra_nft_projects | Terra NFT projects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Notable Incidents

### Kara Waifu Rug Pull
The project Kara Waifu launched on an unknown platform and subsequently executed a "rug pull" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. All of their social media accounts were deleted following the incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. It was also noted that their art drawings appeared to be copied from other projects on different blockchain chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### [[terabytes_nft_incident | Terabytes NFT Incident]]
The artist behind the Terabytes NFT project also disappeared, deleting all social media accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. However, in an unusual turn, the artist reportedly donated all the money raised to the Angel Protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. There are two circulating theories regarding this incident:
*   Some believe the public backlash against the artist was due to the perceived poor quality of their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   Others suggest the artist's work was generated using a "pixel dupe maker," a tool that can automatically create pixel drawings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Regardless of the specifics, both Kara Waifu and Terabytes NFT projects are no longer active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Importance of Due Diligence
Given these incidents, it is crucial for individuals to conduct their own research before investing in any NFT projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This emphasizes a key [[considerations_for_nft_investments | consideration for NFT investments]].

[[ethereum_layer_2_protocols | Arbitrum]] is a prominent [[ethereum_layer_2_protocols | Layer 2]] scaling solution for Ethereum. It currently boasts the highest Total Value Locked (TVL) among [[ethereum_layer_2_protocols | Layer 2]]s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Despite its high TVL, [[ethereum_layer_2_protocols | Arbitrum]] does not yet have its own native token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Arbitrum Odyssey Program

The [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] is an eight-week program designed to encourage users to bridge assets to [[ethereum_layer_2_protocols | Arbitrum]] and interact with various protocols within its ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Participants who engage with these protocols will receive unique NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The program outlines specific tasks for different weeks, including a "bridge week" (Week 1) and subsequent weeks dedicated to testing selected protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] was anticipated to go live by mid-June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Speculations about an Arbitrum Airdrop

There is significant [[speculations_about_an_arbitrum_airdrop | speculation about a potential airdrop]] of an [[ethereum_layer_2_protocols | Arbitrum]] token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This [[speculations_about_an_arbitrum_airdrop | speculation]] is partly fueled by the fact that Optimism, a competitor, also conducted an airdrop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Criteria for such airdrops often include bridging assets to the [[ethereum_layer_2_protocols | Layer 2]] and consistent usage over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Engaging with the [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] is seen as a way to potentially qualify for a future airdrop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, which can be particularly beneficial during a bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Bridging to Arbitrum

Users can bridge assets to [[ethereum_layer_2_protocols | Arbitrum]] through the official bridge, `bridge.arbitrum.io` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

> [!WARNING]
> Bridging from Ethereum [[ethereum_layer_2_protocols | Layer 1]] to [[ethereum_layer_2_protocols | Arbitrum]] is relatively quick, but withdrawing funds from [[ethereum_layer_2_protocols | Arbitrum]] back to [[ethereum_layer_2_protocols | Layer 1]] using the official bridge can take approximately eight days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### Expedited Bridging Options

To avoid the eight-day withdrawal period, users can utilize third-party solutions like [[bridging_process_and_options_for_arbitrum | Hop Exchange]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. [[bridging_process_and_options_for_arbitrum | Hop Exchange]] allows for immediate withdrawal of assets like ETH from [[ethereum_layer_2_protocols | Arbitrum]] back to Ethereum mainnet for a small fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Exchange Support

Some centralized exchanges, including Binance, CDC, and potentially KuCoin, also support bridging to [[ethereum_layer_2_protocols | Arbitrum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. However, whether bridging from these exchanges or the official bridge is preferable for the [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]]'s "bridge week" criteria was uncertain at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Participation Considerations

Engaging with [[ethereum_layer_2_protocols | Arbitrum]] through the [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] involves bridging assets and performing transactions to become an early user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> The primary risk associated with participation is the potential for "wasting" gas fees on transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. However, the potential reward (ROI) includes receiving [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] NFTs and the opportunity to qualify for a future [[speculations_about_an_arbitrum_airdrop | Arbitrum airdrop]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Detailed information about the NFTs and official launch details will be available upon the program's release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

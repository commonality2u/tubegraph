Anchor Protocol offers users the ability to earn high [[anchor_interest_rate_changes | interest]] rates on their deposits, which has sometimes led to initial skepticism about its legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The platform's business model is based on peer-to-peer lending and borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## How Anchor's Yields Work

Anchor Protocol allows individuals to:
*   **Lend:** Users can [[steps_to_deposit_ust_into_anchor | deposit money]] and earn a high annual percentage rate (APR), typically ranging from 19% to 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Borrow:** Users can borrow money by staking their [[collateral_management_for_borrowing_on_anchor | crypto as a collateral]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Borrowers pay a floating [[anchor_interest_rate_changes | interest]] rate and also receive ANC tokens as a reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Maintaining High Yield

The protocol maintains its high yield for lenders through two primary mechanisms:

1.  **Borrower APR:** Borrowers pay a significant annual percentage rate on the funds they borrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. For example, if someone borrows $1,000 at a 21.55% borrow APR, they would pay approximately $210 at the end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
2.  **Staking Rewards from Collateral:** When borrowers stake their [[collateral_management_for_borrowing_on_anchor | crypto as a collateral]], these assets generate [[collateral_and_staking_rewards_in_anchor | staking rewards]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The current [[collateral_and_staking_rewards_in_anchor | staking reward]] return is around 5.83% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Example Scenario

Consider a scenario where:
*   Alice lends $1,000 and expects to earn 20% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   Bob borrows $1,000, using $3,000 worth of bLuna as [[collateral_management_for_borrowing_on_anchor | collateral]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

The income generated by the protocol is calculated as follows:
*   Bob pays 22% on his $1,000 loan, totaling $220 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   The [[collateral_and_staking_rewards_in_anchor | staking reward]] from Bob's $3,000 [[collateral_management_for_borrowing_on_anchor | collateral]] at 5% is $150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

The total collected by the protocol is $370 ($220 from borrow interest + $150 from [[collateral_and_staking_rewards_in_anchor | staking rewards]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

This collected amount is then distributed:
*   $200 goes to Alice (the lender) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   $170 goes to the [[yield_reserve_impact_on_interest_rates | Anchor yield reserve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

This model illustrates the mechanics behind the high yields offered in decentralized finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

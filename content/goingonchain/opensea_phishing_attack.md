A phishing attack on Opensea has been reported, affecting users who buy NFTs on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. As of the report, 17 users had accidentally fallen victim to this attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Incident Details
People tracking the hacker's wallet observed that the stolen Ethereum (ETH) was sent to Tornado Cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Tornado Cash functions like a "washing machine" for cryptocurrency, allowing users to deposit crypto and have it come out in an untraceable destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The situation is currently under investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Background
The attack originated after Opensea released a new smart contract and requested users to migrate their existing listings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This new contract was designed to upgrade and delete inactive NFTs on Ethereum, addressing issues where users had previously lost NFTs due to inactive listings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Opensea shared the link to this new contract on their Twitter channel and via email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. It is believed that the hacker exploited this opportunity to phish some users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Some users have also indicated that the Opensea contract itself might have a flaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Recommendations for [[protecting_against_scams | Protection]]
To be safe, users are advised to [[how_to_revoke_opensea_contract | revoke their approval to Opensea]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This can be done by visiting Dbank, selecting the "approval" section, locating the approval given to Opensea, and then revoking that access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

> [!warning] Gas Fees

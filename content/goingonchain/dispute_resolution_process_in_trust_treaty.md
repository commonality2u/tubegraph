[[how_trust_treaty_works | Trust Treaty]] is a refundable smart contract service built on a blockchain, designed to address the challenges freelancers and independent contractors face with client payments and project agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It provides a Web3 solution for creating fair and progressive contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Contract Creation and Dispute Costs

When a client initiates a contract on [[how_trust_treaty_works | Trust Treaty]], they outline critical information such as the contract title, expectations from both parties, start and end dates, and the agreed price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The price can be locked in USD, USDT, or USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

A platform fee is included in the contract's total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. In the event of a dispute, a maximum dispute cost of 50 is specified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Both the platform fee and the dispute cost will decrease proportionally if the overall contract figures go down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

When the client commits payment for the contract, the funds are moved to a new wallet address secured by the platform, to which the client does not have access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Both users on the platform are represented by their wallet addresses, allowing for anonymity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Dispute Initiation and Resolution Flow

Once the contract is formally signed by both the client and the service provider, it becomes effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. The service provider can use the platform's UI to communicate with the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

If the work is finished, the service provider can request payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. However, if the client identifies issues, they can "open up a dispute" instead of finalizing the agreement and releasing the funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

The dispute resolution process involves:
1.  **Evidence Submission**: Both the client and the service provider are given an opportunity to submit their evidence regarding the dispute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
2.  **Dispute Agents**: Two dispute agents are assigned to the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. These agents independently analyze the situation and provide their assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
3.  **Decision**:
    *   If both dispute agents agree, their decision is final <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The funds will then be released to either the service provider or refunded to the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
    *   If the two agents disagree, a manager is called in to make the final decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

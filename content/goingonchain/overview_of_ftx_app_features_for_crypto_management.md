During volatile market periods and with rising interest rates, it becomes crucial to make crypto assets work harder to generate returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The FTX app is presented as one method to achieve this, offering features for managing and earning yield on crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. This approach contrasts with the issues faced by some centralized finance (CeFi) platforms, which have experienced problems like hot withdrawals or collapse due to exposure to events like Terra or 3AC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The speaker, for instance, withdrew assets from services like Hodlnaut and [[finblox_platform_features | Finblox]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## FTX App vs. FTX Pro

FTX offers two distinct applications: the FTX app and FTX Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. The FTX app is designed with a simpler interface, primarily for buying, selling, depositing, and withdrawing assets, without a complex trading interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. Transfers of ERC20 tokens from FTX Pro to the FTX app are free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

## Key Features and Benefits

### Earning Yield on Assets
The FTX app allows users to park assets like stablecoins (e.g., USDC) and Ethereum to earn an annual percentage yield (APY) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.
*   **APY Tiers**: The first $10,000 earns an 8% APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. Amounts exceeding $10,000 subsequently earn 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. The blended rate can be around 6.1% depending on the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   **Interest Earned**: Users can earn significant interest in a short period, such as $72 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

### Deposit and Withdrawal Options
*   **Deposits**: USDC transferred via ERC20 from FTX Pro to FTX app is free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.
*   **Withdrawals**:
    *   Users can initiate international wire transfers directly from the app to bank accounts that accept foreign currency (e.g., DBS bank account accepting USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.
    *   USDC can be withdrawn to external crypto wallets like Metamask or other crypto wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
    *   Withdrawals are generally free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.
*   **KYC and Withdrawal Limits**: For unverified accounts (non-KYC), the maximum withdrawal limit is $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.

## Source of Yield

The exact source of the yield offered by FTX is not explicitly stated by the platform, but common explanations from various sources include:
*   Lending assets to FTX the platform itself, which uses them for margin and lending activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
*   Using the deposited assets as a source of liquidity for lending and borrowing operations on FTX Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.
*   The yield could be part of FTX's marketing strategy to attract users to the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

## Risks and Risk Management

> [!CAUTION]
> This service is **not risk-free** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. The primary risk is **platform risk**: if FTX were to experience issues or collapse ("FTX store" or "hot withdrawal"), all assets held on the platform could be lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

To manage these risks, prudent risk management is advised, which includes diversifying assets across different platforms or strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. This allows for some assets to continue earning yield while mitigating the overall risk. A mixed strategy, combining parking assets in exchanges like FTX, utilizing decentralized finance (DeFi) options (e.g., Lido or Rocket Pool for liquid staking Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>), and storing assets in personal wallets for price appreciation (emphasizing "your keys, your coin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>), can help manage risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

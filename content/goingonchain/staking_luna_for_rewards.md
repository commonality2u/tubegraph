If you are holding Luna, you can use it to earn more Luna and airdrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. To earn more Luna, you need to stake it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Staking LUNA

To begin staking, navigate to your [[using_terra_wallet_for_staking_operations | Terra wallet]] and click on "Staking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This section provides a list of validators, initially sorted by uptime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. You can change the sorting criteria to commission or voting power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. There are 105 validators available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### [[choosing_validators_for_luna_staking | Choosing Validators]]

When [[choosing_validators_for_luna_staking | choosing a validator]], consider the following criteria:

*   **Voting Power:** It is generally not recommended to stake with the top 5 validators to prevent power centralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. For example, "Orion" has a voting power of 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Self-Delegation:** This indicates the amount a validator has staked themselves, demonstrating their "skin in the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. A higher self-delegation is preferable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Commission:** This is the percentage the validator takes from your rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Look for validators with a 0% commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Uptime:** Validators should ideally have 100% uptime, as you do not earn rewards if they are not operational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

Once you have selected a validator, click "Delegate," input the amount of Luna you wish to stake, click "Next," and confirm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. After delegation, you can view a summary of your staked amount and the rewards you are earning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

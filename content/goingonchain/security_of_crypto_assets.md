The security of crypto assets is a paramount concern in the volatile crypto space. Recent events highlight the importance of understanding how to securely manage and store digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Risks of Centralized Exchanges (CeX)

A significant incident involved Crypto.com sending 220,000 ETH to Gate.io, which the Crypto.com CEO stated was a mistake that was later rectified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This event triggered speculation, including theories about exchanges manipulating assets for proof of reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. While Gate.io clarified that this specific deposit was not included in their October 19th proof of reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, the incident underscored concerns about centralized entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

A critical principle for crypto asset security is "not your key, not your coin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This emphasizes the risk of holding assets on centralized exchanges (CeX), as users do not directly control the private keys to their funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Secure Storage Options: Wallets

Many people are unsure how to properly store their crypto tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Choosing the right wallet is a key component of [[strategies_for_secure_crypto_asset_management]].

### Cold Wallets

Ideally, the best way to secure crypto assets is by using a [[types_of_crypto_wallets | cold wallet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Common cold wallets include Ledger devices, though many brands exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Hot Wallets (Non-Custodial)

If a cold wallet is not an immediate option, [[types_of_crypto_wallets | hot wallets]] can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. These are typically non-custodial, meaning the user is responsible for managing their private keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Losing these keys results in permanent loss of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

Examples of hot wallets mentioned include:
*   **MetaMask**: Supports Ethereum (ETH), Tron, and all EVM-compatible chains like Avalanche (AFX), Fantom (FTM), Polygon (Matic), and Cronos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Blue Wallet**: Recommended for Bitcoin (BTC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Phantom Wallet**: Used for Solana (SOL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Kepler IBC Wallet**: For Cosmos (ATOM) and IBC chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

These wallets offer users more control, allowing for custom network additions and configuration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, which are important [[security_features_of_crypto_wallets]].

### Trust Wallet

For simplicity, Trust Wallet is a multi-chain hot wallet that can store various assets like ETH, BTC, SOL, and Cosmos within one application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. It supports 65 blockchains and covers most commonly owned assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Trust Wallet is maintained and supported by Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. However, it offers less configuration flexibility, such as the inability to add custom networks or set up RPC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

#### Important Security Warning for Trust Wallet

> [!CAUTION]
> Trust Wallet is only available as a mobile application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. To use it on a desktop, it must be connected via WalletConnect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. **Any Trust Wallet extension found in the Chrome Web Store is a scam and is fake** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Users should avoid downloading or interacting with such extensions to prevent asset loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

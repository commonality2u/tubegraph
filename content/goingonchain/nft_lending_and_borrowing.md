[[Introduction to Cryptocurrency Lending Platforms | BendDAO]] is a prominent [[multichain_lending_and_borrowing_protocol | lending and borrowing platform]] specifically designed for NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. It has recently gained significant attention in the NFT market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## How BendDAO Operates

[[Borrowing and Lending Mechanisms on Inverse Finance | BendDAO]] offers several functionalities:

### [[Borrowing and Lending Mechanisms on Inverse Finance | Borrowing]] with NFTs
Users can deposit their NFTs on the platform and [[borrowing_and_lending_strategies | borrow]] ETH (referred to as "if" in the transcript) against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. As of the recording, the interest rate for [[borrowing_and_lending_strategies | borrowing]] ETH with NFTs is a remarkable minus 92% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This negative interest is attributed to an insufficient supply of deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The platform is selective, accepting only seven "blue chip" NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Purchasing NFTs with a Down Payment
BendDAO allows users to purchase NFTs at a discount using a "down payment" system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. For instance, a MAYC with a full price of 14.6 ETH could be acquired for 11.05 ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The remaining balance is considered a [[taking_loans_vs_staking_assets | loan]] from the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, which can be repaid at any time along with the accrued interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Supplying ETH
Users can supply ETH (if) to the platform to earn a high APR, with a total APR of 77% (72% earnings plus 10% platform token) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The current utilization rate for supplied ETH is approximately 95% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Bidding on Liquidating NFTs
The platform enables users to bid on NFTs that are in a liquidating state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. For example, if an NFT owner borrowed 10.82 ETH and the floor price dropped to 12.32 ETH, the NFT enters liquidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The owner has 48 hours to redeem the NFT; otherwise, it goes to the highest bidder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Bid prices must always exceed the previous highest bid by more than 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Challenges and Considerations
While BendDAO aims to provide liquidity for NFT holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, it faces several challenges:
*   **High Utilization Rate**: The high utilization rate for supplied ETH means that those who lend may face difficulties in withdrawing their funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Bidder Risk**: When placing a bid on a liquidating NFT, the ETH must be locked up for 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This creates a risk for bidders, leading to a low number of participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **NFT Valuation**: The provided price floors for NFTs like Bored Apes may not always represent a good deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

BendDAO is evolving to solve these issues and further develop the NFT [[lending_and_borrowing_process_on_anchor_protocol | lending and borrowing]] market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

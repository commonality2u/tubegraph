The Federal Reserve's tightening policies are anticipated to reduce equity in the financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The Fed's explicit objective is to lower inflation, indicating that interest rates will continue to rise until this goal is achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Market Response to Rate Hikes

Since the [[impact_of_interest_rate_hikes_and_liquidity_crisis | interest rate hike]] announcements, the market has shown a trend of selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Furthermore, the presence of an [[recession_indicators_like_the_inverted_yield_curve | inverted yield curve]] typically signals an impending recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. A key consideration is that markets can remain irrational for longer than an individual can stay solvent, suggesting the possibility of further selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Investment Strategies in a Volatile Market

Regarding [[investment_strategies_in_a_volatile_market | investment strategies in a volatile market]], some advise against [[investment_strategies_in_a_volatile_market | buying the dip]] when the Federal Reserve is tightening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. However, for individuals who struggle with [[investment_strategies_in_a_volatile_market | timing the market]], continuing a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy, particularly on blue-chip and infrastructure cryptocurrencies, can be a viable approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Market Timing vs. Dollar-Cost Averaging

*   **Perfect Market Timing:** For those capable of perfectly [[investment_strategies_in_a_volatile_market | timing the market]], significant returns can be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA):** For non-professionals who cannot dedicate extensive time to market observation, [[investment_strategies_in_a_volatile_market | DCA]] can still yield favorable results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Staying in Cash:** Remaining entirely in cash is considered the least effective strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

As an example, based on Bitcoin's (BTC) four-year cycle, if an individual had invested $100 worth of BTC weekly over the past four years, they would still have realized a 200% gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

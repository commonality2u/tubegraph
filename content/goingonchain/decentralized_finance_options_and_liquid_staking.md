During volatile market periods and with rising interest rates, it becomes crucial for crypto assets to generate returns to cover expenses like mortgage interest [00:00:14]. However, many centralized finance (CeFi) platforms have faced significant issues, including exposure to events like Terra or 3AC, leading to withdrawal freezes or insolvency [00:00:25]. Examples include Celsius, Hodlnaut, and Finblox, from which assets have been withdrawn due to these concerns [00:00:40]. While withdrawing assets provides security, it also means they are not earning yield [00:00:44].

## Strategies for Earning Yield on Crypto Assets

To address the need for earning yield while managing risk, several approaches can be considered:

### Centralized Exchange Lending

One method involves parking crypto assets on centralized exchanges that offer lending or earning programs.

*   **KuCoin:** On platforms like KuCoin, users can lend out their crypto assets for interest, often with specified terms (e.g., seven or fourteen days) [00:00:56]. KuCoin also provides a feature called "KuCoin Earn," allowing users to stake stablecoins or Bitcoin to earn a certain Annual Percentage Rate (APR) with flexible or fixed tenures [00:01:10]. These types of services are common across most crypto exchanges [00:01:25].
*   **FTX:** FTX offers two applications: the FTX app and FTX Pro [00:02:11]. The FTX app is designed for simplicity, focusing on buying, selling, depositing, and withdrawing assets [00:02:17]. Transfers of ERC-20 tokens from FTX Pro to the FTX app are free [00:02:32].
    *   **Yield Details:** For stablecoins like USDC, the Annual Percentage Yield (APY) can vary [00:02:54]. The first $10,000 earns an 8% APY, while subsequent amounts drop to 5%, potentially resulting in an average APY of around 6.1% [00:02:57]. Other assets like Ethereum also share a similar APY [00:03:18].
    *   **Withdrawal Information:** For unverified accounts, the maximum withdrawal limit is $2,000 [00:03:25]. Withdrawals can be made via international wire transfer to a foreign currency bank account or by sending USDC to a crypto wallet like MetaMask; both withdrawal methods are typically free [00:03:34].
    *   **Source of Yield:** The precise source of the yield on FTX is not explicitly stated but is speculated to come from lending assets to the FTX platform for margin and lending activities, serving as a source of liquidity for borrowing and lending, or as part of a marketing budget to attract users to the FTX app [00:04:11].
    *   **Risk Acknowledgment:** Using centralized platforms for yield generation is not risk-free, as there is a "platform risk." If the exchange, such as FTX, were to face issues or halt withdrawals, all assets held on the platform could be lost [00:03:59].

### [[Decentralized finance and yield reserves | Decentralized Finance (DeFi)]] & Liquid Staking

Another option is to participate in [[decentralized_finance_and_yield_reserves | DeFi]] protocols, specifically through liquid staking.

*   Platforms like Lido or Rocket Pool allow users to stake their Ethereum (ETH) and earn rewards, typically around 4% [00:01:30].
*   Running one's own node for staking can yield higher ETH rewards [00:01:41].

### Self-Custody

The safest method for managing crypto assets is to store them in a personal wallet, maintaining full control over the private keys [00:01:47]. This approach emphasizes the principle "not your keys, not your coin" [00:01:55]. However, this method relies solely on asset price appreciation and does not generate passive yield [00:01:52].

## Managing Risk

To mitigate the inherent risks associated with earning yield on crypto assets, it is advisable to practice prudent risk management [00:05:11]. This involves diversifying assets across different strategies and platforms to ensure that some assets continue to earn yield while minimizing exposure to any single point of failure [00:05:11].

A project exists that enables users to [[buying_luna_for_cheap_using_kujira | buy Luna for cheap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This system leverages the liquidation process of bLuna, which occurs when loans taken against it exceed a certain threshold.

## How Anchor Protocol Liquidations Work

Typically, users can obtain loans via Anchor Protocol by depositing bLuna as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The recommended Loan-to-Value (LTV) is 45%, with liquidation occurring if the LTV reaches 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

Consider an example:
*   If bLuna is priced at $50, depositing 2 bLuna (worth $100) allows for a $45 loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   Should bLuna drop to $30, the 2 bLuna collateral would be worth $60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   This results in an LTV of 75%, exceeding the 60% liquidation threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   In such a scenario, the borrower keeps the $45 loan but loses their bLuna collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## The Role of Whales and Bots

Historically, liquidated bLuna would go to "whales" or "bots" who could participate in liquidation auctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   These auctions involve bids, where the difference between the highest bid (e.g., $25) and the market price (e.g., $30) determines the discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   For instance, a $5 difference on a $30 market price means the bidder acquires the bLuna at a 16.6% premium, which can also be viewed as a discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Introducing Kujira (Oka) for Retail Bidding

"Oka" (Kujira) enables retail users to bid for liquidated bLuna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### How Bidding Premiums Work
*   Most bids on Oka are placed at a 4-6% premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   A higher premium indicates a lower willingness to pay for the bLuna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   Users place their bid with a specified UST amount as a deposit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   The system prioritizes and triggers bids with the lowest premium first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   A 0% premium is equivalent to purchasing bLuna at market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   When a bid is successful, users receive the discounted bLuna upon withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Kujira's Fee Structure
Kujira generates revenue from two sources:
1.  UST generated from smart contract execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
2.  A 1% withdrawal fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Kujira Token (Kuji) Benefits
Kujira also has its own token, Kuji tokens, which can be used to pay transaction fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Using Kuji tokens provides a discount between 50% and 90% of the UST value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Market Perspective on Kujira
The Kujira team benefits from strong investors and partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Their Initial DEX Offering (IDO) was scheduled for November 12th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. While this concept may not be as appealing in a bull market, it can become highly valuable for securing good deals when the market experiences a downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

Anchor Protocol has expanded its collateral options to include liquid-staked AVAX, known as sAVAX, allowing users to borrow [[ust_on_avax | UST]] directly on the Avalanche chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06">[03:06]</a>. This feature is part of Anchor's strategy to attract more borrowers by adding diverse collateral types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20">[01:20]</a>.

## What is sAVAX?

sAVAX is a yield-bearing token that results from liquid staking AVAX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32">[03:32]</a>. It offers an approximate APR of 7.2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35">[03:35]</a>.

## Obtaining sAVAX

To acquire sAVAX, you can obtain it from Banky's liquid staking platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19">[03:19]</a>. On Banky, you can stake your AVAX, and in return, you will be given sAVAX tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26">[03:26]</a>.

## Borrowing with sAVAX on Anchor

Once you have sAVAX, you can use it as collateral on Anchor Protocol to borrow [[ust_on_avax | UST]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41">[03:41]</a>. This process occurs on the Avalanche chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08">[03:08]</a>.

When borrowing, Anchor provides a recommended Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, typically around 75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47">[03:47]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Cross-chain Considerations
> While a wrapped version of sAVAX (wstAVAX) exists on the Terra chain, using it there requires an additional cross-chain bridge via Wormhole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09">[04:09]</a>. Currently, directly using sAVAX on the Avalanche chain for borrowing is considered the most convenient method for [[defi_yield_opportunities_on_avalanche | earning yield]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27">[04:27]</a>.

This integration of sAVAX as collateral allows for new [[borrowing_and_lending_strategies | borrowing and lending strategies]] within the [[defi_strategies_on_avalanche | DeFi ecosystem on Avalanche]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27">[04:27]</a>, expanding [[avax_collateral_and_borrowing_on_anchor | AVAX collateral and borrowing on Anchor]] options.

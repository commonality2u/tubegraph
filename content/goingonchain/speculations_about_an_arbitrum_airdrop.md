Arbitrum, a Layer 2 solution, currently boasts the highest Total Value Locked (TVL) among L2s but does not yet have its own token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This absence of a native token has led to significant [[speculation_on_bridge_tokens_and_potential_airdrops | speculation]] about a potential future airdrop.

## Context: [[overview_of_arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey Program]]

The [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] is an eight-week program designed to encourage users to bridge assets over to Arbitrum and test various protocols within its ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. In return for participation, users are offered unique NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The latest update indicates that the [[arbitrum_odyssey_campaign_overview | Arbitrum Odyssey]] was likely to go live mid-June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

The program is structured with different weekly focuses:
*   **Week 1:** Bridge Week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   **Week 2 & 3:** Focus on selected protocols for users to test out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>

## The Airdrop Speculation

There is significant [[speculation_on_bridge_tokens_and_potential_airdrops | speculation]] that an airdrop might occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This speculation is largely fueled by the precedent set by Arbitrum's competitor, Optimism, which also released an airdrop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

> [!info] Potential Airdrop Criteria (based on Optimism)
> Learning from Optimism's [[eligibility_for_arbitrum_airdrop | eligibility criteria]], participation in an Arbitrum airdrop might require users to:
> *   Bridge assets over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>
> *   Use the Arbitrum network for a certain period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>

## Participation and Risks

To potentially qualify for an airdrop, the recommended action is to bridge assets over and be an early user, performing some transactions on the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. It's not necessarily about buying a specific coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### [[bridging_process_and_options_for_arbitrum | Bridging Process and Options]]

Users can bridge assets to Arbitrum through several methods:

*   **Official Bridge (`bridge.arbitrum.io`):**
    *   Bridging *to* Arbitrum (L1 to L2) is relatively quick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
    *   Bridging *back* from Arbitrum (L2 to L1) using the official bridge can take approximately eight days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

*   **Hop Exchange:**
    *   This is an alternative that allows immediate transfer of funds from Arbitrum back to the mainnet (L2 to L1) for a small fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

*   **Centralized Exchanges:**
    *   Exchanges like Binance, CDC (Coinbase), and KuCoin offer direct bridging to Arbitrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
    *   It is currently uncertain if bridging through exchanges or the official bridge will be better for airdrop eligibility, and further details are expected for Week 1 of the [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Risks and Rewards

> [!warning] Risk
> The primary risk involved in participating is potentially wasting gas fees on transactions if an airdrop does not occur or if one does not meet the unknown criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

> [!success] Potential Rewards
> If an airdrop does occur, the Return on Investment (ROI) could be significant. Potential rewards include:
> *   Unique NFTs from the [[collecting_nfts_and_airdrops_in_arbitrum_odyssey | Arbitrum Odyssey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
> *   The potential [[speculation_on_bridge_tokens and_potential_airdrops | Arbitrum airdrop opportunity]] itself, which is especially valuable in a bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

The detailed requirements for [[collecting_nfts_and_airdrops_in_arbitrum_odyssey | collecting NFTs]] and airdrops will be released at the official launch of the [[arbitrum_odyssey_campaign_overview | Arbitrum Odyssey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

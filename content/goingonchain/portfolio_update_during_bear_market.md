From: [[goingonchain]] <br/> 

As of early 2022, the market is experiencing a bearish sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The speaker's portfolio is currently down by approximately 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Despite this, crypto adoption continues to grow, with no changes in the underlying technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Investment Strategy

The speaker employs specific strategies to navigate the bear market conditions:

*   **Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)**: The speaker continues to [[market_timing_vs_dollar_cost_averaging | dollar-cost average]] into strong projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This strategy is used to avoid "catching the falling knife" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Accumulation During Bear Markets**: It is considered the best time to accumulate assets during a bear market, although investors must be able to "stomach the pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Specific Crypto Holdings and Actions

### Strong Projects

The speaker is [[market_timing_vs_dollar_cost_averaging | DCA-ing]] into foundational projects such as:
*   Bitcoin (BTC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Fantom (FTM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   Merit Circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>

### Luna

For Luna, the speaker is accumulating using the Anchor Pro strategy, which was previously demonstrated in a past video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

### Frog Nation (wMemo, Spell, Ice)

The speaker holds Spell and wMemo in both their main and "gem" portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

*   **wMemo**: The speaker sold wMemo three days prior to the update but repurchased it after a recent AMA (Ask Me Anything) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This is described as a short-term trading strategy, "scripting" each time an AMA occurs, and the speaker intends to sell wMemo soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Spell and Ice**: These tokens are still being held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The speaker believes they are good products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, despite acknowledging that the "team dynamics" for these projects are "not so good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

Building a [[Valuation Models in DeFi | valuation model]] in [[Yield optimization and decentralized finance DeFi | DeFi]] is a common practice to assess the potential of protocols, especially with the rise of the [[Real Yield in DeFi | real yield]] narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. These models aim to compare protocols based on specific metrics to understand their revenue and fee generation capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Key Metrics and Ratios

Common [[Valuation Models in DeFi | valuation models]] typically involve:
*   **Volume Tracking** Protocols are analyzed by their transaction volume to determine the fees they generate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **P/E Ratio Estimation** A ratio is calculated from the volume and fees to estimate the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This ratio is then used to assess whether a platform might be undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Data Acquisition Tools

Several tools and resources are available to help gather the necessary data for building these models:
*   **Token Terminal** A platform that provides financial metrics for crypto projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Dune Analytics** Known for its community of "smart giga chats" who build informative dashboards that can be utilized for data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Protocol Statistic Pages** Many [[Yield optimization and decentralized finance DeFi | DeFi]] protocols host their own statistic pages directly on their websites, offering relevant information for analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Important Considerations for Model Building

When constructing a [[Valuation Models in DeFi | valuation model]], several factors must be carefully considered to ensure accurate results:
*   **Supply Figures** The choice between using circulating supply versus total supply can significantly alter the model's outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Emissions as Expenses** Token emissions, which are used to attract users, can be treated as expenses within the model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Chain Migration Impact** Consider the implications when a protocol moves to a different blockchain. For example, dYdX's move to Cosmos raises questions about user retention, given the shift from Ethereum's security model and the requirement for different wallets and interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The likelihood of users following such a migration impacts the protocol's future revenue potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

There is no single "right" or "wrong" model; the approach depends on how one chooses to build it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

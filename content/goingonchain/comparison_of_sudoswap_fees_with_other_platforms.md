## Impact on Users and Creators

The fee structure of [[Sudoswap NFT marketplace features | Sudoswap]] has different implications for various participants in the NFT market:

*   **For Traders** Traders tend to favor [[Sudoswap NFT marketplace features | Sudoswap]] because they benefit from the lower platform fee and the absence of royalty fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. When traders set up a pool on [[Sudoswap NFT marketplace features | Sudoswap]], they receive the swap fee, and they don't incur royalty fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. This can result in lower floor prices on [[Sudoswap NFT marketplace features | Sudoswap]] compared to OpenSea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   **For Creators** Creators, conversely, may not prefer [[Sudoswap NFT marketplace features | Sudoswap]] as much because the absence of royalty fees means they do not receive a portion of secondary sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. For instance, if an NFT project with a 5% royalty fee (like Otherside) generated significant revenue from sales on OpenSea, that income stream is not present on [[Sudoswap NFT marketplace features | Sudoswap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

While the reduced fees on [[Sudoswap NFT marketplace features | Sudoswap]] can lead to a lower floor price for NFTs, a potential challenge is that if very few people set up pools, there might be less selection and limited movement in the floor price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

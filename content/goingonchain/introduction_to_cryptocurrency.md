Cryptocurrencies are a form of payment that can be used for trading or in exchange for items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. There are various top cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Blockchain Technology
Cryptocurrency operates on the concept of blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Blockchain can be thought of as a public database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Validators are needed to check on this database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. By validating, they ensure that all transactions are real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### Blockchain Algorithms
Within blockchain, there are two popular algorithms for validating transactions:
1.  **Proof of Work (PoW)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>:
    *   This algorithm requires hardware, as seen with Bitcoin mining, where individuals buy machines and use significant energy to validate transactions on the Bitcoin network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
2.  **Proof of Stake (PoS)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>:
    *   Proof of Stake is being chosen by more protocols because it does not require hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
    *   On a Proof of Stake network, control isn't gained by having a more powerful computer; instead, one needs to own 51% of the cryptocurrency on the network to take it over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Coins vs. Tokens
It's important to understand the difference between coins and tokens in the cryptocurrency space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>:

*   **Coins** are cryptocurrencies that have their own dedicated blockchain or network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Examples include Bitcoin, which runs on the Bitcoin network, and Ethereum, which runs on the Ethereum network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Tokens** are cryptocurrencies that do not operate on their own blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Instead, they run on top of an existing blockchain. Examples like USDC and DAI run on top of the Ethereum chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

The Kujira platform, specifically its OCRA product, enables retail users to bid on liquidated bLuna, often at a discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>. Previously, this process was dominated by "wheels" or "boards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>.

## Liquidation Context

Users can take loans via Anchor Protocol by depositing bLuna as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. The recommended Loan-to-Value (LTV) is 45%, with liquidation occurring if the LTV reaches 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. For example, if 2 bLuna (worth $100) are deposited, allowing a $45 loan, and bLuna drops to $30 (making 2 bLuna worth $60), the LTV becomes 75%, leading to liquidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. The user keeps the $45 loan but loses their bLuna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>.

## Bidding Process and Premium

OCRA allows retail users to bid for this liquidated bLuna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>. The bidding process involves setting a "premium" on the market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>.

*   **Understanding Premium**: A higher premium means a user is willing to pay less for the bLuna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:29">[01:10:29]</a>. For instance, if the market price is $30 and the highest bid is $25, the difference of $5 results in a 16.6% "premium" or discount for the bidder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
*   **Bidding Mechanism**: Users place their bid by inputting a desired premium and depositing their UST amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:30">[01:13:30]</a>. The system prioritizes bids with the lowest premium first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. A premium of 0 is equivalent to buying bLuna at the market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:44">[01:23:44]</a>.
*   **Current Bids**: The majority of bids on OCRA are typically within the 4% to 6% premium range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.

## Fee Structure on OCRA

OCRA generates revenue from two main sources:
1.  UST from smart contract execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:40">[01:34:40]</a>.
2.  A 1% withdrawal fee charged when users withdraw their discounted bLuna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10">[01:29:10]</a>.

### Kuji Tokens for Discounts

Kujira also has its native "Kuji tokens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:35">[01:39:35]</a>. These can be used to pay transaction fees, offering a discount of 50% to 90% off the UST value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:30">[01:42:30]</a>.

### Other Information

The Kujira team has strong investors and partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. They were scheduled to conduct their Initial DEX Offering (IDO) on November 12th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:15">[01:52:15]</a>. While the concept might seem less exciting in a bull market, it could offer good deals when the market turns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

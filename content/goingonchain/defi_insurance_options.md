After experiencing a significant loss due to a hack on Grim Finance, the speaker emphasized the importance of securing investments in decentralized finance (DeFi) through insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. A key lesson highlighted was the adage, "not your keys, not your coins," underscoring the inherent [[losing_cryptocurrency_in_defi | risks associated with losing cryptocurrency in DeFi]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Why Buy DeFi Insurance?

For those with large positions in DeFi, it is recommended to buy insurance to mitigate potential losses from hacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This acts as a safeguard, allowing users to claim back their funds if a protocol is compromised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

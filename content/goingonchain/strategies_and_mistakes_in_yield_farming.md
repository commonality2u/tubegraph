This article explores various aspects of [[yield_farming_and_growing_your_crypto | yield farming]], focusing on strategies and common mistakes, drawn from a personal account of navigating the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The insights shared come from direct experience, including a significant drop in value in a liquidity pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Case Study: [[yield_farming_on_geist_finance | Geist Finance]] Farm

The speaker's experience centers around a farm on the Phantom network called [[yield_farming_on_geist_finance | Geist Finance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Initial Launch and Model
[[yield_farming_on_geist_finance | Geist Finance]] launched on October 6th and quickly grew to about 3 billion TVL (Total Value Locked) in a single day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. It functions similarly to Aave, acting as a money market where users can lend and borrow assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Team and Security
Although the [[yield_farming_on_geist_finance | Geist Finance]] team is anonymous, they have implemented a multisig on their code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This multisig requires three out of five high-profile individuals from the crypto space (including members from File Foundation, SpookySwap, and DefiLlama) to sign off on any code changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. There is also a two-day time lock for changes, contributing to transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### Reward Structure
[[yield_farming_on_geist_finance | Geist Finance]] differentiates itself by aiming for no governance and no VCs, with all platform revenue going back to token holders and equity providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Rewards are distributed in Geist tokens for:
*   Lending and borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>
*   Providing Geist-FTM liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>
*   Airdrops for supplying on Curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>

### Vesting and Locking
To prevent immediate dumping of rewards that could harm the ecosystem, a penalty system is in place:
*   **Vesting**: Rewards are subject to a 50% deduction if withdrawn before 90 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Locking**: Users can choose to lock their Geist tokens for three months, which makes early exit impossible, but allows them to earn platform fees and "supernative" fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Speaker's Investment and Initial Returns
The speaker jumped into the [[yield_farming_on_geist_finance | Geist Finance]] farm because it initially offered a "super crazy" 10,000% APY for its liquidity pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. They invested approximately $2,800, a mix of USDT and FTM, and tracked their experience using an Excel sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

Initially, when the Geist token price was $10 and the daily APR was about 1.21%, the speaker earned around 12 tokens a day, translating to $120 daily on a $1,000 investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Even as the APY dropped (e.g., to 7800% at $9 token price), earnings remained decent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

### The Painful Decline
The situation became "very painful" when:
1.  The price of the farming token (Geist) dropped significantly (e.g., from $10 to $2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
2.  The daily APR and quantity of tokens generated decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
3.  The value of the liquidity pool itself dropped due to the decline in both Geist and FTM prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

This combination resulted in a "triple hit," severely impacting daily earnings (e.g., 4 tokens, about $8/day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Overall, the speaker was down about 20% on their initial investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

## Mistakes and Learnings in [[evaluating_and_managing_yield_farming_risks | Evaluating and Managing Yield Farming Risks]]

The speaker identified several key mistakes and takeaways from their experience:

*   **Exposure to Multiple Volatile Assets**: Being in a liquidity pool (Geist-FTM) exposed the speaker to price drops in both assets, leading to a significant loss when both declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
*   **Rapid Capital Flight**: The speed at which capital fled the Phantom network and [[yield_farming_on_geist_finance | Geist Finance]] was unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Money flowed rapidly to new opportunities like Harmony, DeFi Kingdom, Sushi, and Curve, which integrated with Harmony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Jumping in Directly for High APY**: The immediate jump into a high APY farm, despite the team's apparent decency, was a mistake, as capital flows are extremely fast in the DeFi space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.
*   **Buying Farm Tokens**: One of the cardinal rules for many [[yield_farming_and_growing_your_crypto | yield farming]] experts (e.g., "So Tacky" on YouTube) is not to buy farm tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. The speaker admits to breaking this rule by buying Geist tokens to put into the liquidity pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
*   **"Degen" Nature of High APY Pools**: High APY pools are often "degenerate" (high-risk, high-reward) and require constant monitoring and being "on the ball" to avoid significant losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

## Alternative Strategies

### [[risk_management_in_stablecoin_farming | Stablecoin Farming]]
A less painful approach is to use [[risk_management_in_stablecoin_farming | stablecoins for farming]] (e.g., USDT, DAI, USDC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. With [[risk_management_in_stablecoin_farming | stablecoin farming]], the asset price is pegged to $1, eliminating exposure to asset pricing volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. However, this strategy typically yields lower returns (e.g., 4-8% APR) and requires a "huge capital" (five-digit figures like $20k-$30k) to generate significant passive income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

### [[stablecoin_leveraged_yield_farming | Leveraged Yield Farming]]
The speaker also briefly mentioned [[stablecoin_leveraged_yield_farming | leveraged yield farming]], such as borrowing one asset (e.g., Phantom) against another (e.g., Ethereum) to place into a liquidity pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

## Future Steps

Despite the losses, the speaker decided against cutting losses immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. The strategy moving forward is to vest rewards and lock them for three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. This means taking the 50% penalty on earned Geist tokens and locking them to earn platform fees (in DAI, Geist, Ethereum, FTM, and USDC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. The decision is based on the belief that [[yield_farming_on_geist_finance | Geist Finance]] still holds potential, being the second-highest TVL protocol on the Phantom network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

Yield Protocol is identified as a [[multichain_lending_and_borrowing_protocol | fixed rate borrowing platform]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:37">[01:33:37]</a>. Users can interact with the protocol to either borrow or lend assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:12">[01:36:12]</a>.

## Borrowing on Yield Protocol

To borrow, users can provide collateral and then borrow [[using_stablecoins_in_yield_farming | stablecoins]] such as USDC or DAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:48">[01:40:48]</a>. The borrowing interest rate is fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:26">[01:45:26]</a>. As of the recording, the fixed rate was 0% with a maturity date of September 30, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:32">[01:47:32]</a>. It's important to note that if the loan is not repaid by the maturity date, the interest rate will convert to a variable rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:48">[01:57:48]</a>.

## Lending on Yield Protocol

Users can also lend assets on Yield Protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:20">[02:01:20]</a>. For example, one could lend 50 USDC with a maturity until September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:52">[02:03:52]</a>. While it's possible to withdraw funds at any time, early withdrawals may result in slippage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:21">[02:13:21]</a>.

## Arbitrum Odyssey Week 2 Tasks

For the Arbitrum Odyssey Week 2, participants were required to complete one of three tasks on Yield Protocol, with a minimum sum of $50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:23">[02:18:23]</a>:

1.  Lend $50 of an asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:36">[02:27:36]</a>.
2.  Provide $50 to the liquidity pool (LP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:43">[02:29:43]</a>.
3.  Borrow $100 or more in assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:38">[02:32:38]</a>.

The easiest method to qualify for these tasks was to lend $50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>.

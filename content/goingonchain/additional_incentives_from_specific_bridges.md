During the [[Arbitrum Odyssey bridging strategies | Arbitrum Odyssey]] event, which aimed to encourage users to try out Arbitrum, participants were eligible to receive an NFT for bridging assets [00:00:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Beyond this primary incentive, several bridges offered their own additional rewards for users who transacted through their platforms [00:03:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Specific Bridge Incentives

### Lifi
Lifi announced that they would be rewarding users who bridge with them [00:03:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Although specific details regarding the rewards were not yet released, they mentioned "retracted rewards" [00:03:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Hashflow
Hashflow highlighted that they would distribute a limited edition [[NFT incentives from bridging on Arbitrum | NFT]] [00:03:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Winners of this [[NFT incentives from bridging on Arbitrum | NFT]] would be able to redeem it for Hashflow's token upon its launch [00:03:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Hashflow also allowed users to swap any asset from any chain to ETH on Arbitrum, not just ETH itself [00:03:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

The winning criteria for Hashflow's incentives included:
*   100 participants with the highest total bridging volume [00:03:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   100 randomly selected lucky participants [00:03:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

### Bungee (Bungie)
Bungee offered an additional incentive where users could qualify by being among the top 1,000 addresses with the highest token value bridged in a single transaction [00:04:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Bungee acts as an aggregator, pulling in information to find the highest return or lowest gas fee for users [00:04:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### [[Using Hop Exchange for bridging | Hop Exchange]]
[[Using Hop Exchange for bridging | Hop Exchange]] also provided an extra incentive: 10 fortunate "hoppers" were set to receive a small brand [[NFT incentives from bridging on Arbitrum | NFT]] as a special gift [00:04:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. [[Using Hop Exchange for bridging | Hop Exchange]] was noted as having the highest wallet activation among selected bridges during the bridging week [00:02:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Considerations for Bridging
When bridging, it's important to consider not only gas fees but also slippage [00:04:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Some bridges might have higher slippage, which can impact the final amount received after the transaction [00:05:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

The collapse of Terra's algorithmic stablecoin, UST, alongside its sister token Luna, in May 2022 highlighted significant vulnerabilities within the stablecoin market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This event led to substantial losses for investors and prompted calls for increased [[regulatory_responses_to_stablecoin_instability | regulation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Factors Contributing to the Luna/UST Downfall

The Luna downfall was attributed to several factors:

### Coordinated Attack
A key factor was a "coordinated attack" where attackers obtained a large amount of UST and loaned it against Bitcoin (BTC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. After selling, this action triggered a "bank run" on Anchor Protocol, causing UST to de-peg from its dollar parity as people panicked and started selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Terra-UST Mechanism
The fundamental design of the Terra-UST mechanism played a crucial role. When users sold UST, it automatically minted more Luna tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This created a "dead loop" or "vicious cycle": the more UST was sold, the more Luna was minted, increasing Luna's supply and driving its price down further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### LFG's Bitcoin Reserve Strategy
The Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) held a Bitcoin reserve intended to stabilize UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. However, their continuous selling of BTC to try and stabilize UST contributed to wider market panic, as BTC's price also fell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This strategy ultimately failed to stabilize UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Macroeconomic Factors and Regulatory Scrutiny
Existing negative macroeconomic conditions, including high inflation and unfavorable economic data, exacerbated the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Furthermore, comments from the Treasury Secretary regarding UST and calls for [[regulatory_responses_to_stablecoin_instability | regulation]] added to market instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Impact and Immediate Aftermath
Following these events, UST de-pegged, and Luna's price plummeted significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The Terra team prioritized the UST peg over Luna's price, continuing to burn UST (which minted more Luna), thus driving Luna's price down further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

In addition to Luna's collapse, there was a brief moment where Tether (USDT), another prominent [[types_of_stablecoins | stablecoin]], also lost its peg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

> "The latest tweet by Terra is that... they are prioritizing the [de-]peg over the price of Luna so they are going to continue to burn so when you burn you produce more Luna and you mean more Luna therefore the price of Luna will continue to go down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>

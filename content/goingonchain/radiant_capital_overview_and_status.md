## [[functionality_and_benefits_of_radiant_capital | How Radiant Capital Works]]

[[Radiant Capital overview and status | Radiant Capital]] operates as a [[functionality_and_benefits_of_radiant_capital | cross chain money market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, with the video's goal being to demonstrate [[functionality_and_benefits_of_radiant_capital | how Radiant works]] due to its interesting iterations on the lending protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Common use cases and strategies for money markets include:
1.  **Lending Assets:** Users can lend assets to earn yield and receive money market tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. For example, depositing ETH on [[Radiant Capital overview and status | Radiant]] can earn 2.54% on ETH plus 5.61% APR on the [[Radiant Capital overview and status | Radiant]] token incentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. These percentages are dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
2.  **Borrowing:** Users can borrow assets using their existing holdings as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This allows users to increase leverage without selling assets, though leverage carries significant risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Borrowing USDC, for instance, costs 3.63% but also provides a 5.31% APR incentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### [[radiant_capitals_unique_crosschain_borrowing_feature | Unique Cross-Chain Borrowing]]

[[Radiant Capital overview and status | Radiant]] offers a unique feature: [[radiant_capitals_unique_crosschain_borrowing_feature | cross chain borrowing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Traditionally, borrowing on one chain (e.g., Phantom) means the asset is received on that chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. With [[Radiant Capital overview and status | Radiant]], if a user needs stables on Polygon, they can borrow on Arbitrum and bridge it over to Polygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This functionality is enabled by Stargate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

### Simplified Looping for Yield Farmers

Yield farmers often engage in "looping" to farm more tokens from stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This manual process involves depositing stablecoins, borrowing a percentage, redepositing the borrowed amount, and repeating the cycle to earn more yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. [[Radiant Capital overview and status | Radiant]] has simplified this into a one-click process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. For example, using DAI with 4x leverage (equivalent to looping four times), the net APR is around 32.88%, considering a reward APR of about 41.5% and borrowing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. The price of [[Radiant Capital overview and status | Radiant]] tokens should be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## [[investment_strategies_and_tokenomics_of_radiant_capital | Investment Strategies and Tokenomics]]

### Incentives and Vesting

All [[investment_strategies_and_tokenomics_of_radiant_capital | yields]] earned from lending, borrowing, and LP are vested for 28 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Users can choose to break the vesting, but they will only receive 50% of their rewards, with the remaining 50% going to [[Radiant Capital overview and status | Radiant]] token lockers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This mechanism resembles GMX Finance on FTM, as [[Radiant Capital overview and status | Radiant's]] base code forms its foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

If users choose to lock their tokens, they can receive both [[investment_strategies_and_tokenomics_of_radiant_capital | platform fees]] and penalty fees, but they cannot unstake at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The APR for locking is currently around 800%, though this figure is dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. [[investment_strategies_and_tokenomics_of_radiant_capital | Platform fees]] are paid in various assets, including stablecoins, ETH, and wBTC, derived from users' borrowing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

For liquidity providers, the current LP APR is about 542%, but users should be aware of the risk of impermanent loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This high APR is due to 20% of [[Radiant Capital overview and status | Radiant]] token emissions being allocated to pool 2 rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

### Tokenomics Structure

About 70% of [[Radiant Capital overview and status | Radiant's]] [[investment_strategies_and_tokenomics_of_radiant_capital | tokenomics]] are allocated for incentives, with 50% going to supply and borrowing, and 20% to Pool 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Most of the token unlock schedule takes place within 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

BenDAO, a [[lending_and_borrowing_nfts | lending and borrowing]] platform for NFTs, offers a unique way for users to acquire NFTs at a discounted price, referred to as a "down payment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This feature allows users to purchase select NFTs for less than their full market value.

## How it Works

When buying an NFT through BenDAO's down payment system, the user pays a portion of the NFT's full price upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The remaining amount is effectively borrowed from the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

For instance, an NFT with a full price of 14.6 ETH might be obtainable for 11.05 ETH via this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The difference between the down payment and the full price constitutes the borrowed amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Repayment and Interest

Users have the flexibility to pay back the borrowed amount at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. However, it's crucial to note that interest will be incurred on the borrowed funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Platform Context

BenDAO aims to provide [[instant_liquidity_for_nft_buyers_and_sellers | liquidity for NFT holders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, and this discount/down payment mechanism is one of the ways it facilitates transactions within the NFT market.

Users in Singapore were given one month to withdraw their assets from Binance following an announcement made on September 27, 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Binance's Announcement for Singapore Users

Binance announced on September 27, 2021, that all users in Singapore would no longer have service for [[fiat_deposits_and_withdrawals_halt | fiat deposit and withdrawal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Affected Services and Deadline

As a result of the announcement, the following services were affected:
*   DBS Remit would cease to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   Spot trading would no longer be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   Liquid (likely referring to Binance Liquid Swap) would not work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Users were advised to exit all their assets by October 26, 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Clarifications and Recommendations

There was some confusion regarding specific services after the deadline:
*   **Staking:** A customer service representative indicated that users might still be able to withdraw staked assets like CAKE after October 26, 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Futures Trading:** Futures trading was considered a different service and reportedly not affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Customer Service Information
> Community group inputs suggest that customer service representatives might not have all the answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. If concerned, it is recommended to withdraw coins to self-custody wallets like Trust Wallet or MetaMask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Alternative Exchanges and Strategies

As a response to the withdrawal deadline, individuals sought alternative exchanges. A comparison of top exchanges like FTX, KuCoin, and Huobi (Ho P) was made, benchmarking against Binance on criteria such as liquidity, number of coins, and fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Exchange Comparison Insights
*   **Liquidity:** Huobi (Ho P) showed decent liquidity, followed by FTX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Number of Coins:** For more obscure coins, KuCoin came out on top, followed by Huobi (Ho P) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Trading Fees:** FTX offered the lowest fees, with an additional 3% discount for holding FTX tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Personal Strategy Example
One personal flow involves using a mix of Gemini and KuCoin:
1.  DBS Remit is used to deposit funds into Gemini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
2.  Funds are converted to UST (a stablecoin) on Gemini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
3.  Gemini allows 10 free withdrawals per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
4.  UST is then sent to KuCoin to purchase desired coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
5.  Options for managing assets after purchase include:
    *   Selling assets and sending them to a bank account via XSGD (presumably a Singapore Dollar stablecoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
    *   Selling for UST and sending UST to [[anchor_protocol_loans_and_liquidation | Anchor Protocol]] to earn 19.44% APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
6.  A Huobi (Ho P) account is kept as a standby for peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions involving Singapore dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

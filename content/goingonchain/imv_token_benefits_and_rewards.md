Inverse Finance recently upgraded its governance token to [[Inverse Plus Governance Token Upgrade | Inverse Plus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, aiming to add more value beyond just voting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This new token is referred to as the "positive sum rewards token" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Inverse Finance Ecosystem

Inverse Finance operates with three main products:
*   **IMV Token**: The governance token that can be bought and staked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Anchor**: A platform for lending and borrowing assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **DOLA**: Their native stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### DOLA Stablecoin

DOLA offers farming opportunities available on Ethereum (ETH) and Fantom (FTM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. For swapping, users can utilize Curve or Stabilizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Stabilizer is Inverse Finance's own liquidity pool, comprised of a DAI and DOLA pair, featuring a 0.4% swap fee and guaranteeing a fixed rate of 0.996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The Stabilizer pool has approximately $4 million in liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Anchor Lending and Borrowing Platform

Anchor is Inverse Finance's lending and borrowing setup, with a total TVL (Total Value Locked) of about $65 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. Users can deposit assets to earn a base reward and additional rewards in IMV tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. For example, depositing ETH yields a base reward of 0.08% APY and IMV tokens at a 5.34% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

## IMV Token Benefits

The IMV token stands out with an APY of 122% when supplied to Anchor, as supplying IMV also involves staking it simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. When IMV is deposited into Inverse Finance, users receive xIMV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

Holding xIMV provides several key benefits:

*   **IMV Emission**: Users receive IMV emissions per Ethereum block, approximately 6,400 times a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. Staking IMV for xIMV has a cap of 500% APY, which can only be changed through a governance vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. There is no maximum supply for the IMV token, but the DAO can introduce a cap to cease minting if emissions are too high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
*   **Protocol Revenue Share**: IMV stakers receive a portion of the protocol's revenue, which is generated from borrowing interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
*   **Voting Rights**: xIMV holders gain voting rights within the Inverse Finance governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. The governance page shows active polls, with 35 proposals made and 32 passed, including the recent [[Inverse Plus Governance Token Upgrade | Inverse Plus]] upgrade, all through on-chain voting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.
*   **Collateral for Borrowing DOLA**: One of the most notable features is the ability to use xIMV as collateral to borrow DOLA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. This means users can buy IMV, supply it, earn IMV emissions at 122% APY, earn a cut of the protocol revenue, vote in governance, and still use their staked IMV as collateral to borrow stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. This impressive mechanism allows for capital efficiency, as funds are not locked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

## Transparency

Inverse Finance features a transparency tab on its platform, which is unique among projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. This tab provides links to smart contracts and illustrates how they interact, similar to reviewing a company's balance sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

Vader Protocol aims to combine the best aspects of Thorchain and Luna into an all-in-one Decentralized Finance (DeFi) solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While the concept of its [[amm_and_vaders_unique_components | Automated Market Maker (AMM)]] and stablecoin (USDV) design is described as interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, several challenges and considerations have been noted regarding its implementation and long-term viability.

## Execution Challenges
The primary challenge for Vader Protocol lies in its execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Combining different successful models into one protocol requires precise implementation to function effectively.

## Team Anonymity
The team behind Vader Protocol is anonymous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The community lead is identified as "Dogs Mervin" via a Twitter account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## Vesting Period
For early investors (ve holders) who exchange their "ve bernie" for Vader tokens, 50% is available upfront, with the remaining 50% vesting over one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. The team's allocation of 10% has a two-year linear vesting period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This vesting period is considered to be "a little bit short" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, which could impact the [[vader_tokenomics_and_bond_sales | Vader Tokenomics]] and token price stability if large amounts become available too quickly.

Hundred Finance has introduced a new development: the mirroring event, which allows users to transfer their locked veHND across different blockchain networks [00:00:01]. This feature aims to enhance the user experience and provide greater utility for veHND holders [00:00:18].

## Hundred Finance Overview
[[multichain_lending_and_borrowing_protocol | Hundred Finance]] is a [[multichain_lending_and_borrowing_protocol | multichain lending and borrowing protocol]] available on eight different chains, including Polygon, its latest addition [00:00:26]. Users can engage in several activities on the platform:
*   **Staking Assets**: Earn yield on staked assets [00:00:37]. For example, staking $500 could yield 26% [00:00:41].
*   **Supplying and Borrowing**: Supply assets as collateral to borrow other assets [00:00:46].
*   **Backstop Provision**: Supply assets to participate in liquidations, earning yield in return [00:00:51].

Yields on Hundred Finance are earned in HND tokens [00:01:02].

## HND and mveHND
Users can take their earned HND tokens and [[locking_hnd_for_additional_benefits | lock]] them to convert them into mveHND [00:01:06]. The primary purpose of [[locking_hnd_for_additional_benefits | locking HND]] and obtaining mveHND is to [[using_mvehnd_for_voting_and_boosting_apr | vote for specific pools to boost their APR (Annual Percentage Rate)]] [00:01:11]. For instance, to achieve an 86% APR on FRAX, a user would need to [[locking_hnd_for_additional_benefits | lock enough HND tokens]] to get the maximum boost of 2.5x [00:01:21]. The boost received depends on the amount of HND [[locking_hnd_for_additional_benefits | locked]] and the duration [00:01:32].

## The Challenge Before Mirroring
Prior to the [[hundred_finance_mirroring_event | mirroring event]], if a user had locked veHND on one chain (e.g., Fantom) and wanted to use Hundred Finance on another chain (e.g., Polygon), they would have to perform a separate [[locking_hnd_for_additional_benefits | lockup]] on the new chain [00:02:03]. This "double locking" was a significant downside for users, requiring them to commit more HND tokens across different chains [00:02:03].

## The Solution: The Mirroring Event
The [[hundred_finance_mirroring_event | mirroring event]] allows users to take their [[locking_hnd_for_additional_benefits | locked veHND]] from one chain, such as Fantom (FTM), and mirror it to another, like Polygon, or any other chain supported by Hundred Finance [00:00:08].

### Benefits of Mirroring
The ability to mirror veHND provides several advantages for holders:
*   **Avoids Double Locking**: Users no longer need to perform separate [[locking_hnd_for_additional_benefits | lockups]] on different chains [00:02:03].
*   **Enhanced APR Boosting**: Existing locked veHND can be [[using_mvehnd_for_voting_and_boosting_apr | used to vote and boost APR]] on new chains, such as Polygon, immediately [00:02:13]. This means that the boost (e.g., 1.07x for a USDC pool) is transferable [00:02:18].
*   **Increased Incentive for Multichain Use**: Mirroring gives users more incentive to engage with Hundred Finance across its various supported chains, as their locked HND tokens have immediate utility [00:03:02]. If a user wants to [[earning_yield_on_locked_vehnd_tokens | earn more yield]] on a new chain, they can simply mirror their veHND over and boost the APR on their desired pool [00:03:09].

### How Mirroring Works
Hundred Finance utilizes LayerZero service to facilitate this cross-chain mirroring [00:02:29]. Currently, mveHND mirroring is supported on Arbitrum, Fantom, Optimism, and Polygon, though not all directional transfers are active yet [00:02:33]. For instance, mirroring from Fantom to Polygon functions correctly [00:02:39].

The process to mirror veHND is straightforward:
1.  Navigate to the "Vote" page on the source chain (e.g., Fantom) [00:02:45].
2.  Select the "Mirror lock to a target chain" option [00:02:48].
3.  Choose the desired destination chain [00:02:49].
4.  Click "Mirror" and approve the transaction [00:02:51].

Unlike traditional assets, [[introduction_to_cryptocurrencies | Bitcoin]] is not backed by any physical assets or government body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This contrasts with assets like US Treasury bonds or gold, which have different forms of backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

Due to this lack of traditional backing, there is a [[risk_of_bitcoin_going_to_zero | risk]] that [[introduction_to_cryptocurrencies | Bitcoin]]'s value could go to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

[[citadao_platform_overview | CitaDAO]] is a platform that integrates blockchain technology with real estate assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Unlike many other decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, [[citadao_platform_overview | CitaDAO]] is backed by a physical asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## How the IRO Process Works

The [[citadao_platform_overview | CitaDAO]] platform identifies commercial building owners who are interested in bringing their property onto the blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This process is known as IRO, or "Introducing Real Estate On-chain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

### IRO Commitment and Duration

During an IRO, participants commit USDC into a pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, and a minimum sum must be met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The IRO duration is typically 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. It is important to note that once USDC is committed, it cannot be withdrawn until the IRO concludes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### IRO Outcomes

*   **Successful IRO**: If the minimum sum is met, the IRO is successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Committed USDC is then swapped for Real Estate Tokens (RET) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, and rewards are distributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. RET can be sold on exchanges like Uniswap or used to earn [[citadao_governance_and_knight_token | Knight]] tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Unsuccessful IRO**: If the minimum sum is not met, the funds are refunded back to the participants, and the property is not brought on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### IRO Rewards System

The project provides an IRO reward directly to participants and supporters instead of paying third-party agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

**Reward Calculation Example**:
If the fair value of a property is $100,000 and the daily reward is $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>:
*   If a participant commits $1,000 on day one and no one else participates, they receive 100% of the $1,000 daily reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   If another participant commits $9,000 on day two, the first participant's share of the reward would drop to 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## The Cardiff Building: [[citadao_platform_overview | CitaDAO]]'s First IRO Project

[[citadao_platform_overview | CitaDAO]]'s first IRO project features the "Cardiff building" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   The IRO value, which is the amount needing to be met, is approximately $21 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   The IRO reward for this project is about $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   Details about the property, including its fair value, stable income, and rental income, are highlighted on a dedicated page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   The IRO date for the Cardiff building is yet to be announced, but more information can be found on [[citadao_platform_overview | CitaDAO]]'s Discord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### [[citadao_platform_overview | CitaDAO]] and [[citadao_governance_and_knight_token | Knight]] Token

[[citadao_platform_overview | CitaDAO]] earns 2% from all properties listed on its platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Owning [[citadao_governance_and_knight_token | Knight]] tokens, [[citadao_platform_overview | CitaDAO]]'s governance token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, provides exposure to other properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The [[citadao_governance_and_knight_token | Knight]] token is earned by using the RET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

The [[arbitrum_odyssey_bridging_strategies | Arbitrum Odyssey]] is an eight-week campaign designed to encourage users to try out [[bridging_to_arbitrum | Arbitrum]] [00:00:45] [00:00:47]. By participating, users can receive NFTs [00:00:52]. While the value of these NFTs is uncertain [00:00:55], there is [[arbitrum_airdrop_speculation | speculation on Arbitrum token eligibility]] for future airdrops, with some projects involved not yet having tokens [00:00:58] [00:01:02]. Participating during periods of low gas fees offers a potential for "free money" through airdrops [00:00:22] [00:02:21].

## Arbitrum Odyssey Campaign Details

The [[arbitrum_odyssey_bridging_strategies | Arbitrum Odyssey]] campaign concludes on June 27th at 13:00 Eastern Time (June 28th, 1:00 AM Singapore time) [00:00:32].

The first week of the [[arbitrum_odyssey_bridging_strategies | Arbitrum Odyssey]] focuses on bridging [00:01:11]. The objective is to move ETH to [[bridging_to_arbitrum | Arbitrum]] [00:01:13] [00:01:15]. To qualify for an NFT, users must use a selected list of bridges [00:01:18] [00:01:21].

*   **Assets Counted**: Only ETH is counted during the bridge week [00:01:40] [00:01:44].
*   **Minimum Sum**: There is no minimum sum required to bridge [00:01:31] [00:01:46].
*   **Multiple Bridges**: Users are allowed to use multiple bridges [00:01:34] [00:01:48].
*   **Bonus NFT**: An additional bonus NFT is awarded to users who bridge using the platform that achieves the most wallet bridging activity during the campaign [00:01:24] [00:01:29] [00:02:43]. As of the recording, Hop and Celer Network were leading in wallet activation [00:02:52].

## Airdrop Speculation Beyond NFTs

Beyond the guaranteed NFTs, a significant motivation for participation is the [[arbitrum_airdrop_speculation | speculation on Arbitrum token eligibility]] [00:00:58] [00:01:00]. Additionally, some of the projects and bridges involved in the Odyssey do not yet have their own tokens [00:01:02]. Bridging through these platforms could potentially qualify users for their respective future token airdrops [00:01:05] [00:02:04]. This strategy allows users to potentially "kill two birds with one stone" by qualifying for both Arbitrum and bridge airdrops [00:02:09] [00:02:11].

Some of the [[bridges_without_tokens_for_potential_airdrops | bridges without tokens for potential airdrops]] identified include Li.Fi, Bungee, Hashflow, and Hop [00:02:26].

## [[additional_incentives_from_specific_bridges | Additional Incentives from Specific Bridges]]

Several bridges are offering their own incentives in addition to the [[arbitrum_odyssey_bridging_strategies | Arbitrum Odyssey]] NFTs:

*   **Li.Fi**: Announced they would be rewarding users who bridge with them, though specific details were not released at the time of recording [00:03:07] [00:03:10].
*   **Hashflow**: Will issue a limited edition NFT that winners can redeem for their token at launch [00:03:21] [00:03:24]. Winning criteria include the top 100 participants by highest total volume and 100 randomly selected lucky participants [00:03:37] [00:03:39]. Hashflow also allows swapping any asset from any chain to ETH on Arbitrum [00:03:30].
*   **Bungee**: To qualify for their additional incentive, users need to be among the top 1,000 addresses with the highest token value bridged in a single transaction [00:03:54] [00:03:56]. Bungee acts as an aggregator, pulling information to find the highest return or lowest gas fee for users [00:04:39] [00:04:42].
*   **Hop**: Offers a special gift of a "small brand NFT" to 10 lucky hoppers who bridge with them [00:04:03] [00:04:05].

### Bridging Considerations
When bridging, it's important to consider both gas fees and slippage [00:04:53] [00:04:55]. Different bridges may have varying slippage rates, which can affect the final amount of assets received [00:04:20] [00:04:58].

Hundred Finance recently completed its first mirroring event, a new development that allows users to transfer their locked veHND (vote-escrowed HND) across different blockchain networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This means a user's veHND locked on one chain, such as Fantom (FTM), can be mirrored over to another chain like Polygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## What is Hundred Finance?

Hundred Finance is a multichain lending and borrowing protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. It is available on eight different chains, with Polygon being the latest addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

On Hundred Finance, users can engage in several activities:
*   [[earning_yield_on_hundred_finance | Staking assets]] to [[earning_yield_on_hundred_finance | earn yield]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. For example, staking $500 could yield 26% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   [[staking_and_borrowing_strategies_on_hundred_finance | Supplying assets]] to use as collateral for [[staking_and_borrowing_strategies_on_hundred_finance | borrowing other assets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   Participating in backstop provision, which involves supplying assets for liquidation and also [[earning_yield_on_hundred_finance | earning yield]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

Yield is earned in HND tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. These HND tokens can then be locked up to become mveHND (or veHND), which can be used to vote for specific pools to [[staking_and_yield_earning_on_hundred_finance | boost the Annual Percentage Rate (APR)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Locking more HND for a longer period yields a higher boost, up to a maximum of 2.5x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. For instance, locking 1000 HND for four years could achieve the maximum 2.5x boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Benefits of Mirroring veHND

The mirroring event addresses a key challenge for users operating on multiple chains within the Hundred Finance ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Previously, to [[staking_and_yield_earning_on_hundred_finance | boost APR]] on a new chain, users would have to perform a separate HND lockup on that chain, leading to "double locking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

With mirroring, users can now simply transfer their existing locked veHND from one chain to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This allows them to use their veHND to vote and [[staking_and_yield_earning_on_hundred_finance | boost their APR]] on the target chain, such as Polygon, without needing to lock additional tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. For example, mirrored mveHND can be used to achieve a 1.07x boost on a USDC pool on Polygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

This feature provides immediate utility and incentive for users to engage with Hundred Finance on various chains, as they can seamlessly transfer their boosting power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## How Mirroring Works

Hundred Finance utilizes the LayerZero service to facilitate this cross-chain mirroring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Currently, mveHND mirroring is supported across Arbitrum, Fantom, Optimism, and Polygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. While not all mirroring directions are fully ready, the Fantom to Polygon direction has been confirmed to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

To mirror veHND:
1.  Navigate to the vote page on the source chain (e.g., Fantom) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
2.  Select the "Mirror lock to a target chain" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
3.  Choose the desired destination chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
4.  Click "Mirror" and approve the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

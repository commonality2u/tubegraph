[[Hundred Finance]] has recently completed its first mirroring event, a new development designed to enhance the multichain experience for its users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## What is the Mirroring Event?

The mirroring event allows users to take their locked veHND (vote-escrowed HND) tokens from one chain, such as Fantom (FTM), and mirror them over to another chain where Hundred Finance operates, like Polygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This feature enables users to utilize their veHND across different chains without needing to lock up separate amounts of tokens on each chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Hundred Finance Overview

[[Hundred Finance overview | Hundred Finance]] is a multichain lending and borrowing protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. It is currently available on 8 different chains, with Polygon being the latest addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

On Hundred Finance, users can:
*   [[earning_yield_on_hundred_finance | Stake assets to earn yield]] (e.g., staking $500 can earn 26% yield) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   Supply assets to use as collateral for borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   Participate in backstop provision, supplying assets for liquidation and earning yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

Yields are earned in HND tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. These HND tokens can then be locked to obtain mveHND, which can be used to vote for specific pools to boost their APR (Annual Percentage Rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. For example, locking 300 HND for 4 years can provide a 1.5x boost, while 1000 HND can achieve the maximum boost of 2.5x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Benefits of Mirroring

The mirroring feature provides significant [[benefits of mirroring veHND across chains | advantages for veHND holders]]:
*   **Avoids Double Locking**: Without mirroring, users would need to perform separate lockups on each chain where they use Hundred Finance, which is a disadvantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Mirroring eliminates this need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **Cross-Chain APR Boosting**: Users can mirror their locked veHND from one chain (e.g., Fantom) to another (e.g., Polygon) and use it to vote and boost their APR on the new chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. For instance, mirrored mveHND can provide a 1.07x boost to a USDC pool on Polygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Increased User Incentive**: This capability provides a strong incentive for users to engage with Hundred Finance across multiple chains, as they can immediately leverage their existing veHND to earn more yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Technical Implementation and Supported Chains

Hundred Finance utilizes LayerZero service to facilitate this mirroring functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

Currently, mveHND mirroring is supported on:
*   Arbitrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
*   Fantom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
*   Optimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
*   Polygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>

While not all mirroring directions are ready yet, the functionality from Fantom to Polygon is confirmed to be working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## How to Mirror veHND

To mirror veHND, users can follow these steps from the vote page on their source chain (e.g., Fantom chain):
1.  Locate the "Mirror" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
2.  Choose the desired destination chain (e.g., Polygon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
3.  Click "Mirror" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
4.  Approve the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

Once completed, the mveHND will be mirrored to the target chain, ready for use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

Anchor Protocol's current 19.5% [[interest_rates_and_yields_on_anchor | interest rate]] is expected to decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. A new vote has passed to make the [[interest_rates_and_yields_on_anchor | earn rate]] dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, primarily to make Anchor sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Dynamic Earn Rate Formula

The change in [[interest_rates_and_yields_on_anchor | interest]] will depend on a specific formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   If the [[yield_reserve_impact_on_interest_rates | yield reserve]] increases by 5%, the [[interest_rates_and_yields_on_anchor | interest]] will increase by 1.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   If the [[yield_reserve_impact_on_interest_rates | yield reserve]] drops by 5%, the [[interest_rates_and_yields_on_anchor | interest]] will drop by 1.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
These adjustments will occur monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Yield Reserve Trends and Solutions

The [[yield_reserve_impact_on_interest_rates | yield reserve]] has been on a downward trend over the past 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This is due to more people depositing than borrowing on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

To address this imbalance, Anchor plans to add more [[collateral_management_for_borrowing_on_anchor | collateral]] to encourage more borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Recently, AVAX was added, allowing its users to borrow UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. However, adding [[collateral_management_for_borrowing_on_anchor | collateral]] is a time-consuming process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Future Expectations and Personal Strategy

Given the current trends and the time required to add more [[collateral_management_for_borrowing_on_anchor | collateral]], the [[interest_rates_and_yields_on_anchor | interest rate]] for Anchor is expected to decrease in the coming months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Even with a reduction of 1.5% per month, the rate is anticipated to remain higher than what traditional local banks offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

The speaker plans to continue using Anchor while also taking a wait-and-see approach and exploring other stablecoin yield opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

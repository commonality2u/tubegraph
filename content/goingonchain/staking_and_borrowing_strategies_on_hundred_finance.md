[[hundred_finance_mirroring_event | Hundred Finance]] offers distinct ways to [[strategies_for_earning_interest_on_crypto_assets | earn rewards]] and manage assets, primarily differentiating between supply APY and stake APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Supplying Assets and Earning Supply APY

When you supply a stable or crypto asset on [[hundred_finance_mirroring_event | Hundred Finance]], you will be [[earning_yield_on_hundred_finance | earning the supply apy]] on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Your exposure remains with your stable or crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. As a receipt for your supplied assets, you receive an "h-token" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. For example, if you supply MEME, you will receive hMEME as a receipt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

If you supply 500 MEME on [[hundred_finance_mirroring_event | Hundred Finance]], you will only receive the supply APY, for instance, 0.27% APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The higher APR on HND tokens (e.g., 18.89%) is not earned through mere supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Staking for HND Rewards

To earn the HND token APR, you must [[staking_and_yield_earning_on_hundred_finance | stake]] your supplied crypto asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This means [[staking_and_yield_earning_on_hundred_finance | staking]] your h-token receipt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. [[staking_and_yield_earning_on_hundred_finance | Staking]] your h-token allows you to earn HND rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Important Consideration: Staking and Borrowing

A critical point to note is that once you [[staking_and_yield_earning_on_hundred_finance | stake]] your assets, you will no longer be able to [[borrowing_against_crypto_assets | take a loan]] against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. If your objective is to [[borrowing_against_crypto_assets | take a loan]], you should only supply your assets and not [[staking_and_yield_earning_on_hundred_finance | stake]] them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

For example, if you supply 500 MEME and then choose to [[staking_and_yield_earning_on_hundred_finance | stake]] 50% of your hMEME, your supply value will drop by half, and consequently, the amount you can [[borrowing_against_crypto_assets | borrow]] will also drop by half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Withdrawing HND Rewards

To withdraw your earned HND rewards, navigate to the HND section on the platform and select "collect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This dashboard also provides an overview of your supply APR and [[staking_and_yield_earning_on_hundred_finance | staking]] APR for the HND token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Borrowing Against Supplied Assets

If you wish to [[borrowing_against_crypto_assets | take a loan]], you must only supply your assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. For instance, if you supply 500 MEME, you can [[borrowing_against_crypto_assets | take a loan]] for another token like SPELL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. You can [[borrowing_against_crypto_assets | borrow]] up to 50% of your limit, for example, 14,000 tokens of SPELL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Utilizing HND Tokens: veHND

Once you have HND tokens, you can lock them up to [[strategies_for_earning_interest_on_crypto_assets | earn more rewards]] in the form of veHND (Vote-Escrowed HND) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### veHND Calculation

The amount of veHND you receive depends on the lock-up period for your HND tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>:
*   Locking 100 HND for 4 years yields 100 veHND <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   Locking 100 HND for 2 years yields 50 veHND <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

If you add more HND to an existing lock-up, the new tokens will follow the previously committed lock-up period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. For example, if you initially committed to a 2-year lock-up, adding more HND will also follow this 2-year period, resulting in 50% of the HND converting to veHND <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### What You Can Do with veHND

With veHND, you can do two main things:

1.  **Vote for Pools**: You can vote to direct more HND rewards to specific pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The more votes a pool receives, the higher its average APR on HND rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
2.  **Boost Your Own Rewards**: You can boost your personal APR by up to 2.5 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. [[hundred_finance_mirroring_event | Hundred Finance]] provides a calculator to determine how much veHND you need for the maximum 2.5x boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. You can only vote every 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

After locking up HND and applying the boost, your [[staking_and_yield_earning_on_hundred_finance | staking]] APR can significantly increase, for example, from 18.87% to 45% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. The APR can change in the next epoch, especially if other pools receive more votes (e.g., USDC pool) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Epochs typically end every 2 days and 13 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

[[maximal_extractable_value_mev_on_ethereum | MEV]], also known as [[maximal_extractable_value_mev_on_ethereum | Maximum Extractive Value]], is a complex and deep subject that serves as both a blessing and a problem for blockchain networks, especially Ethereum, due to its profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Although prominent on Ethereum, [[maximal_extractable_value_mev_on_ethereum | MEV]] occurs on any network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## What is [[maximal_extractable_value_mev_on_ethereum | MEV]]?
[[maximal_extractable_value_mev_on_ethereum | MEV]] refers to the maximum value that can be extracted from block production, in excess of the standard block reward and gas fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This extraction can be achieved by including, excluding, or changing the order of transactions within a block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Previously known as "Miner Extractable Value," the term shifted to "Maximum Extractor Value" with the advent of Proof of Stake (POS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

Block producers, whether miners or validators, receive standard block rewards for their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. However, they possess the power to prioritize transactions that offer more rewards, thereby increasing their profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. The total extracted [[maximal_extractable_value_mev_on_ethereum | MEV]] is currently estimated at about $675 million, highlighting its profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## How Transactions Flow and [[maximal_extractable_value_mev_on_ethereum | MEV]] Works
Transactions, such as swapping tokens on Uniswap, making purchases on OpenC, or sending tokens to wallets, all enter a public mempool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This mempool acts as a transparent holding area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Validators then select and process these transactions, appending them to the blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

While validators technically have the power to select pending transactions based on economic incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, in practice, independent actors called "searchers" actively monitor the mempool for profitable transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Most searchers utilize bots for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. The profits generated by these searchers are shared with the block producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## [[mev_extraction_strategies_like_gas_sniffing_and_front_running | MEV Extraction Strategies]]

### [[mev_extraction_strategies_like_gas_sniffing_and_front_running | Gas Sniffing]]
The goal of [[mev_extraction_strategies_like_gas_sniffing_and_front_running | gas sniffing]] is to ensure transactions use the least amount of gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Gas fees are calculated as gas price multiplied by gas used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Searchers can achieve this by:
1.  Using long strings of zeros in their addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
2.  Leaving small token balances in smart contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
Both methods reduce the space a transaction takes, leading to lower gas consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Searchers can then increase the gas price to prioritize their transaction while keeping the overall gas consumed low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### [[mev_extraction_strategies_like_gas_sniffing_and_front_running | Generalized Front Running]]
If a bot identifies a profitable transaction in the mempool, it can copy the original transaction, increase the [[maximal_extractable_value_mev_on_ethereum | MEV]] (SV), and process its own transaction first, effectively [[mev_extraction_strategies_like_gas_sniffing_and_front_running | front running]] the original user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Back Running
This strategy occurs when a token is about to be listed, for example, on Uniswap, by adding liquidity (e.g., 50% Token A and 50% Stable B) to a pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Searchers monitoring the mempool will spot this transaction and immediately scoop up the token at a very low price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Later, when the price rises, they sell their tokens, acting as the very first traders in the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

### [[use_of_flashbots_in_privacypreserving_mev_extraction | Flashbots]]
[[use_of_flashbots_in_privacypreserving_mev_extraction | Flashbots]] connect searchers and block producers in a private pool, preventing [[maximal_extractable_value_mev_on_ethereum | MEV]] extraction from affecting public gas prices for retail users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Searchers find opportunities in the mempool, bundle them, and send them to a [[use_of_flashbots_in_privacypreserving_mev_extraction | Flashbots]] platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. From there, block builders construct blocks and send them to a relay, where the most profitable block is selected and sent to validators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## Common Use Cases of [[maximal_extractable_value_mev_on_ethereum | MEV]]

### [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | DEX Arbitrage]]
This is one of the most common [[maximal_extractable_value_mev_on_ethereum | MEV]] use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. It involves profiting from price differences between different [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | decentralized exchanges]] (DEXs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. For example, if SushiSwap and Uniswap offer ETH/DAI at different prices, a searcher can buy the token on the lower-priced [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | DEX]] and sell it on the higher-priced [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | DEX]] in a single transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Liquidations
Bots continuously search for liquidation opportunities to earn liquidation fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Sandwich Trading
In a sandwich attack, a bot monitors a user's transaction, such as a large buy order for 10,000 Uniswap tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. The bot will then [[mev_extraction_strategies_like_gas_sniffing_and_front_running | front run]] the user's transaction by buying Uniswap tokens itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. After the user's transaction is processed, the bot sells its newly acquired Uniswap tokens back to the user at a higher price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. This results in the original user experiencing price impact and high slippage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

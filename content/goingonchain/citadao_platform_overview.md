CitaDAO is a platform that integrates blockchain technology with real estate assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Unlike many other decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, CitaDAO's offerings are backed by physical assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## How CitaDAO Works

The platform's process involves several key steps to bring real estate on-chain:

1.  **Property Sourcing** CitaDAO seeks out commercial building owners who are interested in tokenizing their properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
2.  **[[iro_process_in_citadao | Introducing Real Estate On-chain (IRO)]]** Once a property is identified, an [[iro_process_in_citadao | IRO]] process commences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
    *   **Commitment Phase** During an [[iro_process_in_citadao | IRO]], participants commit USDC into a pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. A minimum financial sum must be met and committed by participants for the [[iro_process_in_citadao | IRO]] to be successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The commitment period is typically 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
    *   **Detailed Property Information** CitaDAO provides a detailed page for each property, highlighting its fair value, stable income, and rental income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
    *   **Reward System** If the [[iro_process_in_citadao | IRO]] is successful, tokens and rewards are distributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The [[iro_process_in_citadao | IRO]] reward is offered because, instead of paying third-party agents, the fees are given directly to the participants and supporters of the [[iro_process_in_citadao | IRO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Participants should note that funds committed cannot be withdrawn until the [[iro_process_in_citadao | IRO]] concludes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
    *   **Failure Condition** If the minimum sum is not met, the committed funds are returned to the participants, and the property is not brought on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Example: Cardiff Building IRO

The first project on CitaDAO is the Cardiff Building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   The [[iro_process_in_citadao | IRO]] value to be met for Cardiff Building is approximately $21 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   The associated [[iro_process_in_citadao | IRO]] reward is about $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   The [[iro_process_in_citadao | IRO]] date was yet to be announced at the time of discussion, but more information was available via Discord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Real Estate Token (RET)

If an [[iro_process_in_citadao | IRO]] is successful, the committed USDC is swapped for RET, which stands for Real Estate Token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Holders of RET can sell these tokens on platforms like Uniswap or use them to earn [[citadao_governance_and_knight_token | Knight]] tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## [[citadao_governance_and_knight_token | CitaDAO Governance]] and [[citadao_governance_and_knight_token | Knight Token]]

[[citadao_governance_and_knight_token | Knight]] is CitaDAO's governance token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The platform generates revenue by taking 2% of all properties listed on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Owning [[citadao_governance_and_knight_token | Knight]] tokens provides exposure to other properties within the CitaDAO ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Workflow Summary

The complete workflow for an [[iro_process_in_citadao | IRO]] is as follows:
*   **Successful [[iro_process_in_citadao | IRO]]** After 10 days, if the [[iro_process_in_citadao | IRO]] is successful, participants receive their RET tokens and rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Unsuccessful [[iro_process_in_citadao | IRO]]** If the [[iro_process_in_citadao | IRO]] is not successful, participants receive a refund of their committed funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

CitaDAO is considered an interesting project due to its unique feature of backing tokens with physical assets, providing a tangible value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

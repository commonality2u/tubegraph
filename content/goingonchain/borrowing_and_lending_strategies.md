Hundred Finance is a Compound-form platform that operates across multiple chains, including the Phantom network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Its primary utility is [[borrowing_and_lending_mechanisms_on_inverse_finance | lending and borrowing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

Here are five strategies to earn yield on Hundred Finance:

## 1. Supply Asset and Borrow Stable
This strategy involves supplying a crypto asset as collateral and then borrowing stablecoins, which are then re-supplied and staked back into Hundred Finance to earn additional yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

*   **Process:**
    1.  Supply an asset (e.g., ETH) as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
    2.  Borrow a stablecoin (e.g., MIM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
    3.  Supply the borrowed stablecoin back into Hundred Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
    4.  Stake the stablecoin to earn supply and stake rewards in HND tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Example Yield:** Supplying and staking MIM can yield 11.11% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Boosting Yield with HND
To achieve higher yields, such as 27% APR on MIM, users can purchase and lock HND tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

*   **Process:**
    1.  Go to the "vote" section of the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
    2.  Lock up HND to receive veHND (vote-escrowed HND) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
    3.  Use veHND to vote for the specific gauge (e.g., MIM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Boost Calculation:** A boost calculator is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The maximum boost obtainable is 2.5x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Locking 300 HND for four years for a $3,000 stake can achieve a 2.5x boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Locking for one year provides a 1.46x boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## 2. Backstop Provision
Users can participate in the backstop provision by providing liquidity, typically USDC, which the platform uses to execute liquidations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

*   **Yield:** Providing USDC for backstop provision can yield around 8.79% eAPR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## 3. Leverage Long and Leverage Short Strategies
Hundred Finance allows users to execute [[leverage_long_and_short_strategies | leverage long and leverage short strategies]] on crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. The platform provides documentation and numbers for these strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

*   **Leverage Long:**
    1.  Supply a crypto asset (e.g., ETH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
    2.  Borrow a stablecoin (e.g., USDC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
    3.  Use the borrowed stablecoin to buy more of the crypto asset you want to long (e.g., buy more ETH on a DEX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
    4.  If the asset price increases, sell a portion of the asset, repay the stablecoin loan, and keep the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Leverage Short:**
    1.  Supply a stablecoin or crypto asset as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
    2.  Borrow the crypto asset you want to short (e.g., BTC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
    3.  Immediately sell the borrowed asset for stablecoins on a DEX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
    4.  If the asset price decreases, use the stablecoins to buy back the asset at a lower price and repay the loan, earning the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## 4. Provide Liquidity
Users can provide liquidity to pools involving HND tokens to earn yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

*   **Example Pool:** HND, FTM, and USDC.
*   **Proportion:** 60% HND, 20% FTM, and 20% USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Yield:** The combined APR can be as high as 110% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## 5. Using Lendi
Lendi is a specific deployment by Hundred Finance where the team borrows USDC from users, using HND as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This allows the team to provide liquidity on the HND/wFTM pool in Solidly to receive SOLID emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

*   **Process:** Provide USDC to the Lendi pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Yield:** Providing USDC via Lendi can earn 34.25% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This is considered a strong yield for stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Rewards:** Rewards can be withdrawn by going to the "stake" section and selecting "claim HND" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

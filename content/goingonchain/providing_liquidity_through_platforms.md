Hundred Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform similar to Compound, but with multi-chain capabilities, currently operating on several networks like the Phantom network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Its primary functions include [[introduction_to_cryptocurrency_lending_platforms | lending and borrowing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Users can earn yield through various methods on the platform, including directly [[liquidity_provision_and_its_benefits | providing liquidity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Methods of Providing Liquidity

### 1. Backstop Provision
Users can participate in "backstop provision" by providing liquidity to the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This liquidity is used by the platform to execute liquidations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. By supplying USDC for backstop provision, users can earn an estimated annual percentage rate (eAPR) of approximately 8.79% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### 2. Direct Liquidity Provision
Directly [[liquidity_provision_and_its_benefits | providing liquidity]] to a pool is another method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. For example, liquidity can be added on "bits" in a specific proportion: 60% HND, 20% FTM, and 20% USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This method can yield a combined APR of 110% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### 3. Lendi Deployment
Lendi is a specialized deployment by Hundred Finance designed to facilitate liquidity provision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. The goal of Lendi is for the Hundred Finance team to borrow USDC from users, using HND as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This borrowed USDC is then used to provide liquidity to the HND/WFTM pool in Solidly, aiming to receive "solid emission" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Users providing USDC through Lendi can earn an APR of 34.25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This is considered a strong yield, especially for stablecoin investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Rewards, such as HND tokens, can be claimed from the "stake" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

These methods demonstrate the power of [[decentralized_finance_options and liquid staking | DeFi]] in enabling various strategies for earning yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

The importance of owning your crypto assets by storing them in a non-custodial manner has been highlighted due to incidents such as Crypto.com's accidental transfer of 220,000 ETH to Gate.io, which triggered speculation about exchanges helping each other with Proof of Reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The core principle is "not your key, not your coin," emphasizing the need to move assets out of centralized exchanges (CeX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Cold Wallets (Hardware Wallets)

Cold wallets are considered the ideal method for storing crypto tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Examples** Ledger is a commonly used brand, though many other brands exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Purpose** They provide enhanced [[security_of_crypto_assets | security by keeping private keys offline]], making them less vulnerable to online threats.

## Hot Wallets (Software Wallets)

Hot wallets are a viable alternative when a cold wallet isn't immediately available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. These are [[using_and_storing_in_noncustodial_wallets | non-custodial wallets]], meaning you are responsible for managing your own keys; losing them results in the loss of all assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. They generally offer more control, allowing users to add networks and configurations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Specific Hot Wallet Examples:

*   **MetaMask**
    *   Supports Ethereum (ETH), Binance Smart Chain (BNB), Tron (TRX) (likely referring to EVM compatibility here), Avalanche (AVAX), Fantom (FTM), Polygon (MATIC), and Cronos (CRO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
    *   Compatible with all EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
    *   Cannot be used for Bitcoin (BTC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Blue Wallet**
    *   Used specifically for Bitcoin (BTC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Phantom Wallet**
    *   Primarily used for Solana (SOL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Keplr IBC Wallet**
    *   Used for Cosmos (ATOM) and other IBC-enabled chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Trust Wallet

For users seeking a simple, multi-chain wallet, Trust Wallet is an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Features**
    *   Allows storage of various assets like ETH, BTC, SOL, and Cosmos within a single application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
    *   Maintained and supported by Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
    *   Supports 65 blockchains, covering most commonly owned assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
    *   Offers less configuration flexibility, preventing users from adding custom networks or satellite RPC (Remote Procedure Call) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **[[trust_wallet_app_risks | Important Security Information]]**
    *   Trust Wallet is exclusively available as a mobile application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
    *   To use Trust Wallet on a desktop, it must be connected via WalletConnect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
    *   Any Trust Wallet extension found in the Chrome Web Store is a [[how_to_recognize_scam_wallets | scam]] and is fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Users should avoid these fake extensions as they can compromise asset [[security_features_of_crypto_wallets | security]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

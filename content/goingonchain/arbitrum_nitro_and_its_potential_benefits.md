[[arbitrum_nitro_upgrade | Arbitrum Nitro]] is an upcoming upgrade for Arbitrum, designed to enhance the network's performance and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. It is described as an "accelerated version of Arbitrum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Purpose and Benefits

The primary goal of [[arbitrum_nitro_upgrade | Arbitrum Nitro]] is to improve the network's capacity and reduce transaction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Specifically, it aims to:
*   **Reduce heavy load**: [[arbitrum_nitro_upgrade | Nitro]] will help to "reduce the heavy load on the chain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Reduce gas fees**: By reducing the load, [[arbitrum_nitro_upgrade | Nitro]] is expected to decrease gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This is crucial for Arbitrum, as an [[layer_2_solutions_and_arbitrums_role | L2]] solution, which is "supposed to be cheaper on the guest fee" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Prior to [[arbitrum_nitro_upgrade | Nitro]], a swap on Arbitrum once cost around $21 in swap fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, which was considered "very cl" for an [[layer_2_solutions_and_arbitrums_role | L2]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Impact on [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]]

The [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey program]] was temporarily paused due to a surge in gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The campaign will only restart "after they launch [[arbitrum_nitro_upgrade | Nitro]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

Hundred Finance is a [[multichain_projects|multichain]] [[introduction_to_cryptocurrency_lending_platforms|lending and borrowing protocol]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> that operates across 8 different chains, with Polygon being its latest addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Core Features of Hundred Finance

Users on Hundred Finance can engage in several activities:
*   **Staking Assets** Users can stake their assets to earn yield, for example, staking $500 to earn a 26% yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Supplying Collateral and Borrowing** Assets can be supplied as collateral to borrow other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Backstop Provision** Users can participate in backstop provision, which involves supplying assets for taking part in liquidations, and in return, they also earn yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

Yield earned on Hundred Finance is paid in HND tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## HND Token and APR Boosting

The HND tokens can be locked up to convert them into mveHND (mirrored veHND) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. With mveHND, users can vote for specific pools to boost their Annual Percentage Rate (APR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. For instance, to achieve an 86% APR on FRAX, a user would need to lock enough HND tokens to get the maximum boost of 2.5x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Locking 300 HND for four years might provide a 1.5x boost, while 1000 HND could yield the maximum 2.5x boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## The Mirroring Event

Hundred Finance recently completed its first "mirroring event" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This feature allows users to take their locked veHND on one chain, such as Fantom (FTM), and mirror it over to another chain, like Polygon, or any other chain that Hundred Finance supports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

### Benefits of Mirroring

The primary benefit of mirroring is that it eliminates the need for separate lockups on multiple chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Without mirroring, a user operating on both Fantom and Polygon would have to lock HND tokens on each chain individually. With mirroring, users can simply transfer the utility of their locked tokens across chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This mirrored mveHND can then be used to vote and boost APRs on the destination chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. For example, a user could mirror mveHND to the Polygon chain to boost their USDC pool APR by 1.07x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Technical Implementation

Hundred Finance utilizes LayerZero service to facilitate this cross-chain mirroring functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Currently, mveHND mirroring is supported on Arbitrum, Fantom, Optimism, and Polygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. While not all mirroring directions are yet available, the Fantom to Polygon transfer functions seamlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### How to Mirror veHND

To mirror locked veHND:
1.  Navigate to the vote page on the source chain (e.g., Fantom) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
2.  Find the "Mirror lock to a target chain" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
3.  Choose the desired destination chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
4.  Click "Mirror" and approve the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

The mirroring feature provides a significant incentive for users to utilize Hundred Finance across different chains, as it allows for immediate utility without requiring additional token commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

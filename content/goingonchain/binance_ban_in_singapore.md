Binance made an announcement on September 27, 2021, stating that all users in Singapore would no longer have access to certain services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Users were given one month to [[withdrawal_processes_before_binance_ban | withdraw assets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Impact of the Ban

Following the announcement, several key services became unavailable:
*   No fiat [[deposits_and_withdrawals_on_binance_for_singapore_residents | deposit and withdrawal]] via DBS Remit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   No more spot [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrency_on_binance | trading]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   No more liquid swap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Users were requested to exit all assets by October 26, 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

### Withdrawal After Deadline

There was confusion regarding whether assets could still be withdrawn after the October 26, 2021, deadline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. While customer service (CS) indicated that withdrawals might still be possible, it was advised that if users were concerned, they should transfer their coins to self-custody wallets like Trust Wallet or MetaMask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

Future trading services were reportedly not affected, as CS indicated it was a different service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This information was gathered from a community group that engaged with Binance CS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## [[alternatives_to_binance_for_trading | Alternative Exchanges]]

To identify suitable [[alternatives_to_binance_for_trading | alternative exchanges]], a poll was conducted within a community group to see what exchanges users were utilizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The top exchanges were compared based on three components:
1.  Liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
2.  Number of [[cryptocurrency_options_on_binance_sg_vs_binance_global | coins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
3.  [[regulation_and_fees_on_binance_sg_vs_binance_global | Fees]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>

Binance was used as the benchmark for comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, with data sourced from CMC and [[regulation_and_fees_on_binance_sg_vs_binance_global | fees]] based on the first tier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Comparison of Exchanges

*   **Liquidity:** Having good liquidity allows for a tighter spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. In this regard, Huobi (HP) appeared decent, followed by FTX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Number of Coins:** For users interested in more unknown [[cryptocurrency_options_on_binance_sg_vs_binance_global | coins]], KuCoin and Huobi (HP) were highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Fees:** For active traders, FTX had the lowest [[regulation_and_fees_on_binance_sg_vs_binance_global | fees]], offering an additional 3% discount if FTX tokens are held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### Personal Trading Flow

A suggested flow involves using a mix of Gemini and KuCoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>:
1.  **Fund Gemini:** Use [[transaction_methods_for_buying_and_selling_on_binance_platforms | DBS Remit]] to fund Gemini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
2.  **Convert to UST:** Change funds to UST (a stablecoin) on Gemini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
3.  **Transfer to KuCoin:** Utilize Gemini's feature of 10 free withdrawals per month to send UST to KuCoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
4.  **Buy Coins:** [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrency_on_binance | Buy]] desired coins on KuCoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
5.  **Exit Options:**
    *   [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrency_on_binance | Sell]] coins and send them to [[differences_between_binance_sg_and_binance_global | Binance SG]] to cash out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
    *   [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrency_on_binance | Sell]] for UST and send the UST to Anchor Protocol to earn yield (e.g., 19.44% APY), treating it like a bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

As a standby, a Huobi (HP) account can be used for [[transaction_methods_for_buying_and_selling_on_binance_platforms | peer-to-peer (P2P)]] transactions for Singapore dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

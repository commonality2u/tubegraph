Following an announcement on September 27, 2021, [[Regulation of Binance platforms | Binance]] began restricting its services for users in Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Users were given a one-month period to withdraw assets, with a deadline of October 26, 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Affected Services

The restrictions primarily impacted:
*   **Fiat Deposit and Withdrawal** Financial services like DBS Remit no longer function for these transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   **Spot Trading** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
*   **Liquid Swap** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>

## Unaffected Services

Despite the broad restrictions, some services were noted to remain operational:
*   **Staked Assets** Users were informed by customer service that they could still withdraw staked assets (e.g., CAKE) even after the October 26, 2021, deadline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Futures Trading** This service was considered separate and not affected by the restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## User Recommendations

Users who were concerned about their assets on [[Buying and selling cryptocurrency on Binance | Binance]] were advised to transfer their coins to personal wallets such as Trust Wallet or Metamask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Alternatives to Binance

For [[Cryptocurrency trading in Singapore | cryptocurrency trading in Singapore]], several [[alternatives_to_binance | alternative exchanges]] emerged. A community poll indicated popular choices, which were compared based on liquidity, number of available coins, and fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

| Exchange | Liquidity (vs. Binance) | Number of Coins (Good for less known) | Fees (Good for frequent traders) |
| :------- | :---------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------- |
| FTX      | Decent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>            |                                       | Lowest fees; 3% discount for holding FTX token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a> |
| KuCoin   |                         | Top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>                             |                                   |
| Huobi    | Decent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>            | Top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>                             |                                   |

### Example Workflow for Trading in Singapore

One suggested workflow for [[Cryptocurrency trading in Singapore | cryptocurrency trading]] after the [[Regulation of Binance platforms | Binance]] restrictions involved a combination of exchanges:
1.  **Fund Gemini**: Use DBS Remit to deposit funds into Gemini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
2.  **Convert to UST**: On Gemini, convert SGD to UST (a stablecoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
3.  **Transfer to KuCoin**: Utilize Gemini's free withdrawal (up to 10 times per month) to send UST to KuCoin for purchasing desired cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
4.  **Exit Strategies**:
    *   Sell assets on KuCoin and send to [[connections_between_finblox_and_other_platforms_like_binance_and_ftx | Finblox]] for fiat withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
    *   Sell for UST on KuCoin and send to Anchor Protocol to earn yield (e.g., 19.44% APY) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
5.  **Backup**: Maintain a Huobi account for peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions involving Singapore dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

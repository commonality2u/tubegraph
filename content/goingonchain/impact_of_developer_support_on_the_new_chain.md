The viability of a new blockchain, particularly one emerging from a hard fork, is heavily dependent on the support and continued engagement of app developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Developer Central to New Chain's Value

Following the proposed hard fork, the new Terra chain, named Luna, will exist without a stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. While new Luna tokens are planned to be airdropped to existing holders (Luna Classic, stakers, and UST holders) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, the most critical recipients are the app developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

The perspective is that if developers are not "saved" and do not build on the new chain, the new chain itself becomes "worthless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

> "If there are no app developers... being saved then on the new chain and no developer build on it then the new chain is also worthless." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>

## Challenges for the New Chain

A significant challenge for the new Luna chain is uncertainty regarding how many developers will choose to remain and build on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Without developers creating applications, the chain's future will be "quite hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Competition for Talent

Other blockchain ecosystems are actively seeking to attract developers from the Terra network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Examples include [[polygon_and_layer_2_development | Polygon]], Juno, and Fantom, all of which are "trying to lure the Terra projects developers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## User Experience (UX) as a Developer Incentive

Despite its recent challenges, Terra was noted for its strong user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The experience of using a Terra wallet was considered "so much better" compared to MetaMask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

If another chain can replicate or "bring that experience over," it would represent a "big win" for that chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, underscoring the value of developers capable of delivering superior UX.

From: [[goingonchain]] <br/> 

Geist Finance is a decentralized, non-custodian money market protocol operating on the [[phantom_network | Phantom network]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:13">[02:10:13]</a>. It functions similarly to AAVE, allowing users to lend and borrow money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

The platform first launched on October 6th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a> and rapidly grew, accumulating approximately $3 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL) within a single day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. Geist Finance distinguishes itself by having no governance and no Venture Capital (VC) involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. All revenue generated from the platform is distributed back to its token holders and equity providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

## Security and Transparency
Despite having an anonymous team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>, Geist Finance has implemented a multisig (multi-signature) system for its code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. This requires three out of five high-profile individuals from the DeFi space (including Filecoin Foundation, SpookySwap, and DeFi Llama) to sign off on any code changes, enhancing security and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. Additionally, a two-day time lock is in place for any changes, further promoting transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. The team is also noted for being very transparent in their Telegram group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

## Earning Yield on Geist Finance
Users can earn GUYS tokens through several methods:
*   **Lending and Borrowing**: Rewards are given for both supplying and borrowing assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. For example, borrowing FTM can yield 42% APR in GUYS tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.
*   **Providing Liquidity**: Users providing liquidity to the GUYS-FTM liquidity pool also earn GUYS rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   **Airdrops**: Airdrops are offered for supplying on Curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

To prevent immediate selling and maintain ecosystem stability, a penalty system is in place:
*   Rewards must be held for at least 90 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.
*   Exiting rewards before 90 days incurs a 50% deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

Users can choose to stake or lock their GUYS tokens:
*   **Staking**: Allows for early exit but still faces the 50% penalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.
*   **Locking**: Requires a three-month lock-up period, prohibiting early exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. Locked GUYS earn platform fees and "supernative fees" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. These platform fees include earnings in DAI, GUYS, Ethereum, FTM, and USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>.

## User Experience and Lessons Learned
The speaker engaged in [[yield_farming_and_growing_your_crypto | yield farming]] on Geist Finance, initially attracted by a "super crazy" 10,000% APY for its liquidity pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

### Initial Investment and Returns
The speaker invested a total of $2,800, primarily in a mix of USDT and FTM, with about $1,000 going into the liquidity pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. The GUYS token price was initially around $8 when the speaker entered (day 2 or 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>.

The revenue from [[yield_farming_and_growing_your_crypto | farming]] is calculated as:
`Revenue = Price of farming token * Quantity generated` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>.
The quantity generated is derived from the daily APR (APY divided by 365) multiplied by the liquidity pool value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. At an APY of 10,000% and a GUYS price of $10, the daily earnings were approximately 12 GUYS tokens, equating to $120 per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.

### Challenges and Losses
The speaker is currently down about 20% on the investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. The GUYS token price has dropped significantly from $8-10 to $1.95 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. This decline led to a "triple hit" scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:00">[17:53:00]</a>:
1.  **Price of the farming token (GUYS) decreased** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.
2.  **APY decreased significantly** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.
3.  **Liquidity pool value (GUYS-FTM) dropped** because both GUYS and FTM prices declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.

This combination resulted in daily earnings dropping to about 4 tokens, worth around $8 a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>.

## Market Dynamics and Capital Flight
The speaker observed that capital fled the platform much faster than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>. While in the past, money might slowly bridge from one network (e.g., Polygon) to another (e.g., Avalanche), in this instance, capital quickly shifted from Phantom to Harmony due to new liquidity mining programs, such as those on [[defy_kingdom | DeFi Kingdom]], Sushi, and Curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. This rapid shift highlights the importance of being constantly on the ball when involved in liquidity pool farming with non-[[stablecoin_leveraged_yield_farming | stablecoin]] assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>.

## [[strategies_and_mistakes_in_yield_farming | Strategies and Mistakes in Yield Farming]]

### Identified Mistakes
The speaker acknowledges several mistakes:
*   **Jumping in directly** due to high APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>.
*   **Buying farm tokens** to put into the liquidity pool, which goes against a key rule from a respected yield farming YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:00">[18:41:00]</a>.
*   Being unprepared for the **rapid capital flow** out of the farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:44:00">[17:44:00]</a>.
*   Being exposed to the "triple hit" scenario, which could have been mitigated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:00">[17:53:00]</a>.

### Alternative Strategies: [[stablecoin_leveraged_yield_farming | Stablecoin Yield Farming]]
The speaker notes that using [[stablecoin_leveraged_yield_farming | stablecoins to farm]] (e.g., USDT, DAI, USDC) removes exposure to asset price fluctuations, as they are pegged to $1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. While the APY might be lower (e.g., 8% for USDT), it provides a more stable passive income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>. This approach is slower but requires a larger capital investment (e.g., $20,000-$30,000) for significant returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>.

### Future Strategy
Despite the current losses, the speaker plans to continue by vesting and locking the earned GUYS rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>. The goal is to exit the current pool every two days, take the 50% penalty, and then lock the remaining rewards for three months until January <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>. This strategy aims to earn platform and penalty fees, banking on Geist Finance's continued potential given its position as the second-highest TVL protocol on the Phantom network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:32:00">[19:32:00]</a>. The maximum acceptable loss for this strategy is estimated at $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:00">[16:02:00]</a>.

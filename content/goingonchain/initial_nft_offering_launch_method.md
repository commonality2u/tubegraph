The DC DAO project employs an "Initial NFT Offering" (INO) as its token launch strategy, which it describes as an interesting approach compared to other token launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:59">[02:00:59]</a>.

## How the INO Works

The core concept of the INO is that users must purchase an [[NFT and tokenization | NFT]] to secure an allocation for the project's EGS tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>. This sale is conducted via an auction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:04">[02:10:04]</a>.

### NFT Tiers

There are three tiers of NFTs available in the auction:
*   **God Tier** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:08">[02:16:08]</a>
    *   This is the highest tier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:07">[02:19:07]</a>.
    *   It has a starting bid of 4200 FTM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:07">[02:20:07]</a>.
*   **Dante Tier** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:05">[02:17:05]</a>
*   **Damning God Tier** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:05">[02:17:05]</a>

### Token Allocation

Purchasing an NFT provides an EGS token allocation. For example, acquiring a Dante tier NFT for 500 FTM awards a maximum allocation of 600 FTM worth of EGS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:06">[02:24:06]</a>. If FTM is $3 and EGS is $1 at pre-sale, this means the user could buy $1920 worth of EGS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

### NFT Benefits and Boosts

Beyond token allocation, holding an NFT provides additional benefits:
*   **Staking Boost** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:08">[02:43:08]</a>: A Dante tier NFT provides a 2.5% boost in staking rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:08">[02:43:08]</a>.
*   **Bonding Boost** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>: A Dante tier NFT provides a 5% bonding boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
*   **Lottery System** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:06">[02:47:06]</a>: Users can participate in a lottery. For instance, a "bronze Dante" NFT could grant an additional 25% allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:09">[02:49:09]</a>.

### Tokenomics

A significant portion of the EGS token supply, 80% of the initial offering, is directed to the NFT auction. This ensures that a large majority of the tokens are distributed to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:04">[03:02:04]</a>.

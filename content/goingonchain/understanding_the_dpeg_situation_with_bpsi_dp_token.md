The bPsiDP token is a receipt token issued by the Nexus Protocol's liquid Pylon Pool on the Terra blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It functions as a representation of a deposit within a 24-month pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Liquid Pylon Pool Mechanics

Participants deposit UST (Terra's stablecoin) into a 24-month locked pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. As a reward, users receive Nexus tokens, with the current Annual Percentage Rate (APR) being around 15.73% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This mechanism resembles a bond, where the initial principal is returned along with accumulated rewards after the 24-month period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

A key distinction of the liquid Pylon Pool from a regular Pylon Pool is the issuance of the bPsiDP receipt token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This token allows users to exit their position before the 24-month lock-up by trading it on platforms like TerraShot for UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## The Depeg Situation

Currently, the bPsiDP token is experiencing a depeg, or "d-pack," meaning it trades at a discount relative to its underlying value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This depeg is approximately 28% to 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. For example, $100 UST could be used to acquire $128.82 worth of bPsiDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This $128.82 in bPsiDP then reflects a deposit of $128.973 UST in the Pylon pool, despite only $100 UST initially being spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

This discrepancy is likely due to market bearishness, leading some users to sell their bPsiDP tokens, creating the price imbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Arbitrage Opportunity

The depeg presents a potential arbitrage opportunity, particularly for those bullish on the Nexus token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>:

1.  **Purchase at Discount**: Acquire bPsiDP at its current depegged price (e.g., paying $100 to receive bPsiDP equivalent to $128.82 worth of deposited UST) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
2.  **Wait for Repack**: The ideal scenario is for the bPsiDP price to return closer to its peg, allowing the holder to sell their bPsiDP for a profit in UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
3.  **Long-Term Hold (Worst Case)**: If the depeg persists, the holder can wait for the full 24-month lock-up period to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. After 24 months, the initial principal value represented by the bPsiDP (e.g., $128.82 in the example) will be redeemable from the Pylon pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. During this waiting period, the user also continues to earn Nexus token rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Risks

*   **Depeg Persistence**: There is a risk that the depeg might not correct itself, requiring the user to wait the full 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Time Horizon**: A 24-month waiting period is considered "very, very, very long" in the context of cryptocurrency markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   **Nexus Token Price Volatility**: The profitability of the long-term hold depends on the price of the Nexus token remaining favorable or increasing, as rewards are paid in Nexus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

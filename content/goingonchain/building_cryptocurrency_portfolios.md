Building a cryptocurrency portfolio involves understanding and managing inherent risks, as well as tailoring strategies to individual risk profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>. Personal experiences, such as losing a position due to a hack, underscore the volatile nature of the decentralized finance (DeFi) space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Importance of Risk Management

A fundamental principle in [[strategies_for_secure_crypto_asset_management | secure crypto asset management]] is "not your keys, not your coins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This emphasizes the importance of maintaining direct control over one's digital assets.

## Utilizing DeFi Insurance

For those with significant positions in DeFi protocols, considering insurance is a crucial risk mitigation strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Platforms like InsureDAO (referred to as "insure") offer coverage for various protocols within ecosystems, such as the Fantom ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

Key points regarding DeFi insurance:
*   **Coverage**: Insurance can protect against hacks on supported protocols, allowing users to reclaim funds if an incident occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. For example, if a large position is held in Abracadabra, insurance can be purchased to cover potential hacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Limitations**: Not all protocols may be covered; for instance, Grim Finance was not covered by InsureDAO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Availability**: Insurance options, such as for Anchor Protocol, can run out quickly, requiring frequent checks for availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

From: [[goingonchain]] <br/> 

Arbitrum is a Layer 2 scaling solution that currently boasts the highest Total Value Locked (TVL) among its peers, despite not yet having its own native token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. To encourage user engagement and test different protocols, Arbitrum launched the [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey program]], an eight-week initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This program invites users to bridge assets to Arbitrum, offering unique [[nft_incentives_from_bridging_on_arbitrum | NFTs]] in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. There is also [[arbitrum_airdrop_speculation | speculation]] that participation might lead to eligibility for a future token airdrop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

The [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey program]] is expected to go live in mid-June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The first week of the program is designated as "Bridge Week" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Reasons for Bridging

One of the primary reasons for [[arbitrum_airdrop_speculation | speculation regarding an Arbitrum airdrop]] stems from its competitor, [[optimism_and_arbitrum_airdrops | Optimism]], which previously conducted an airdrop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The eligibility criteria for the [[optimism_and_arbitrum_airdrops | Optimism airdrop]] included bridging assets and using the Optimism network for a period of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This has fueled [[speculation_on_arbitrum_token_eligibility | expectations that similar actions on Arbitrum]], such as bridging and interacting with protocols, could be prerequisites for a potential Arbitrum airdrop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Bridging Methods

Users have several options for bridging their assets to Arbitrum:

### Official Bridge
The official Arbitrum bridge (bridge.arbitrum.io) facilitates transfers from Ethereum Layer 1 (L1) to Arbitrum Layer 2 (L2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. However, it's important to note that bridging back from L2 to L1 using the official bridge can take approximately eight days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### [[bridges_without_tokens_for_potential_airdrops | Hop Exchange]]
For faster transfers back from Arbitrum to mainnet, [[bridges_without_tokens_for_potential_airdrops | Hop Exchange]] offers a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. While it incurs a small fee, it allows users to retrieve their Ethereum (ETH) almost immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Centralized Exchanges
Several centralized exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase (CDC), and KuCoin, also support direct bridging to Arbitrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. However, it is currently uncertain whether bridging via these exchanges will be considered eligible for [[arbitrum_odyssey_bridging_strategies | Arbitrum Odyssey's Bridge Week]] or potential airdrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Users are advised to await official details for Week 1 before deciding on this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Risks and Rewards

The effort involved in bridging to Arbitrum primarily entails being an early user and performing some transactions, not necessarily buying coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

*   **Risk**: The main risk is potentially wasting gas fees on transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Reward**: The potential return on investment (ROI) includes receiving unique [[nft_incentives_from_bridging_on_arbitrum | NFTs]] from the Arbitrum Odyssey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. More significantly, there is the opportunity for a potential [[arbitrum_airdrop_speculation | Arbitrum token airdrop]], which is seen as a beneficial prospect, especially during a bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Further details regarding NFT rewards and airdrop eligibility are expected upon the official launch of the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

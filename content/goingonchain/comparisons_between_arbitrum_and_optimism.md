Arbitrum is a Layer 2 solution that currently boasts the highest Total Value Locked (TVL) among Layer 2s, but it does not yet have its own token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Arbitrum Overview
The [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey program]] is an eight-week initiative designed to encourage users to bridge assets and engage with various protocols on Arbitrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Participants are eligible to receive unique NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

There are [[speculations_about_an_arbitrum_airdrop | speculations about an Arbitrum airdrop]] tied to this program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] was anticipated to go live mid-June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Bridging to Arbitrum
Users can bridge assets to Arbitrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Official Bridge:** Using the official bridge, bridge.arbitrum.io, involves a bridging time, and returning assets from L2 to L1 takes approximately eight days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Hop Exchange:** This extended bridging time can be circumvented by using Hop Exchange, which allows immediate retrieval of assets for a small fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Centralized Exchanges:** Exchanges like Binance, CDC, and KuCoin also support bridging to Arbitrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

The recommended action for users is to bridge over and be an early user by performing transactions, though this carries the risk of incurring gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The return on investment (ROI) includes potential NFTs from the [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] and the possibility of an Arbitrum airdrop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Potential Airdrop
> An airdrop is considered a beneficial outcome, especially during a bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Optimism's Airdrop Precedent
The [[speculations_about_an_arbitrum_airdrop | speculation about an Arbitrum airdrop]] is partly fueled by the fact that its competitor, Optimism, has already conducted an airdrop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Optimism's airdrop eligibility criteria included bridging assets over and using the Optimism network for a certain duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

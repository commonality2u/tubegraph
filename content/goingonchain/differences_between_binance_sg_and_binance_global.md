When considering [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrency_on_binance | buying crypto]] in Singapore, two primary Binance platforms are available: Binance SG and Binance Global (Binance.com) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. While they are both part of Binance, they operate differently in terms of regulation, supported currencies, fees, and transaction methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Regulation

*   **Binance SG** is a subsidiary of Binance and is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
*   **Binance Global (Binance.com)** is not regulated by MAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Transaction Currency

*   **Binance SG** conducts all transactions via SGD (Singapore Dollars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Binance Global** conducts all transactions via USD (United States Dollars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Trading Fees and Cryptocurrency Options

*   **Binance SG** has a trading fee of 0.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a> and supports only eight cryptocurrencies for trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Binance Global** has much lower transaction fees, with an additional discount if trades are made using Binance Coin (BNB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. It supports a significantly larger number of [[cryptocurrency_options_on_binance_sg_vs_binance_global | cryptocurrencies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, including Dogecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Deposits and Withdrawals for Singapore Residents

### Binance SG
*   To deposit money into Binance SG, a third-party payment provider called XanPool is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   There are no fees for [[deposits_and_withdrawals_on_binance_for_singapore_residents | deposit and withdrawal]] on Binance SG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Binance Global
When [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrency_on_binance | buying crypto]] on Binance Global, there are three main [[transaction_methods_for_buying_and_selling_on_binance_platforms | ways]]:
1.  Using a credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
2.  Through Peer-to-Peer (P2P) transactions, where users exchange SGD for crypto directly with another person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
3.  Buying Binance Coin (BNB) on Binance SG and then sending it to Binance Global to purchase desired cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

For selling crypto on Binance Global, the opposite methods apply:
1.  Using P2P to sell crypto and receive SGD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
2.  Converting crypto back into Binance Coin (BNB), sending it to Binance SG, and then converting it back into SGD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Wallet Linkage

It is crucial to note that the wallets on Binance SG and Binance Global are not linked; they are two separate wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This means that crypto bought on Binance SG cannot be directly sold on Binance Global <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a> "One very important thing to note is that you cannot buy in Binance Singapore and sell in Finance Global. What I'm saying is that the wallet are not linked. They are two separate wallets."

Following the [[binance_ban_in_singapore | Binance ban in Singapore]], users were given one month to [[use_of_deposit_and_withdrawal_wallets | withdraw assets]] from the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Binance Announcement and Affected Services
On September 27, 2021, Binance announced that users in Singapore would no longer have access to certain services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Specifically, this included:
*   Fiat [[deposits_and_withdrawals_on_binance_for_singapore_residents | deposit and withdrawal]] services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   DBS Remit, a method for [[transaction_methods_for_buying_and_selling_on_binance_platforms | transactions]], would no longer function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrency_on_binance | Spot trading]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   Liquid Swap services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Users were advised to exit all their assets by October 26, 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Specific Withdrawal Clarifications
Community group inputs provided some clarity regarding specific situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>:
*   **Staking**: Customer service indicated that users would still be able to [[use_of_deposit_and_withdrawal_wallets | withdraw]] staked coins (e.g., "cake") even after the October 26, 2021 deadline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Futures Trading**: Futures trading was considered a different service and was reportedly not affected by these restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Recommended Withdrawal Methods
For those concerned about their assets, it was suggested to move coins to external wallets such as Trust Wallet or MetaMask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

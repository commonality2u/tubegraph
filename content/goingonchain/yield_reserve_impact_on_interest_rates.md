From: [[goingonchain]] <br/> 

Anchor Protocol's 19.5% [[interest_rates_and_yields_on_anchor | interest rate]] is projected to decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This change is due to a newly passed vote that will make the earn rate dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The primary goal of this adjustment is to ensure the sustainability of Anchor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## [[anchors_dynamic_earn_rates_and_yield_reserve_trends | Dynamic Earn Rate]] Mechanism

The extent of the [[anchor_interest_rate_changes | interest rate changes]] will depend on a specific formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. For instance, if the yield reserve increases by 5%, the interest will increase by 1.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Conversely, if the yield reserve drops by 5%, the interest will decrease by 1.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. These adjustments are scheduled to occur monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Yield Reserve Trends

Over the past 30 days, the yield reserve has been on a downward trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This decline indicates that more users are depositing funds than are borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Strategies to Improve the Gap

To address the imbalance between deposits and borrowings, Anchor plans to add more collateral options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This strategy aims to encourage more borrowing activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Recently, Avalanche (AVAX) was added as collateral, allowing AVAX users to borrow UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. However, adding new collateral takes time and cannot be done quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Outlook and Personal Strategy

Given the current trends, the [[interest_rates_and_yields_on_anchor | interest rate]] for Anchor is expected to start decreasing in the coming months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Despite the anticipated reduction, the speaker intends to continue using Anchor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, as even with a 1.5% monthly decrease, the rate is expected to remain higher than traditional bank offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The approach involves a "wait and see" strategy while also exploring other stablecoin yield opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

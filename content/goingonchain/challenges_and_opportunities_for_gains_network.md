## Overview
[[gains_network_overview | Gains Network]] is a synthetic exchange called Gains Trade, designed for leveraged traders on the Polygon chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. The platform aims to differentiate itself in the competitive decentralized leverage trading space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

## Key Challenges

### Past Challenges
*   **High Gas Fees on Mainnet**
    Initially launched on the Ethereum mainnet in January 2021, [[gains_network_overview | Gains Network]] faced problems due to high gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. This led to their transition to the Polygon chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.

### Current & Future Concerns
*   **Liquidity on Polygon vs. Mainnet**
    A potential concern is that most of the liquidity for market leaders like dYdX resides on the Ethereum mainnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. Building out on Polygon might present a challenge in attracting sufficient liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. However, if [[gains_network_overview | Gains Network]] can achieve multi-chain expansion, it could significantly increase its liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>.

## Opportunities and Strengths

### Addressing Trader Concerns
*   **Combating "Scam Week"**
    [[gains_network_overview | Gains Network]] tackles the issue of "scam week" (purposely manipulated price spikes to trigger stop losses) by building a custom Decentralized Oracle Network (DON) enabled by Chainlink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. This DON provides real-time prices to traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. The system aggregates median prices from eight different on-demand Chainlink nodes, each taking the median from seven exchange APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. If a price difference exceeds 1.5% from the Chainlink price feed, the node's answer is rejected, ensuring a real and fair spot price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.
*   **Low Gas Fees**
    Being built on the Polygon chain allows for cheap gas fees, enabling the platform to perform frequent price updates to reflect the best price for traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.
*   **Solving Low Liquidity**
    [[gains_network_overview | Gains Network]] addresses low liquidity by using its [[role_of_gns_tokens_in_gains_network | GNS token]] to build up liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. The GNS DAI pool acts as liquidity for the synthetic trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

### Product Features and Advantages
*   **Diverse Asset Selection & High Leverage**
    The platform offers a wide selection of assets, including crypto and forex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. It allows for high leverage, up to 150x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.
*   **Competitive Fees**
    Trading fees range from 0.06% to 0.08% for maker and taker, with no funding fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. A typical spread of about 0.025% needs to be accounted for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   **NFT Utility**
    [[arbitrage_opportunities_in_nfts | Gains Network]] NFTs offer real DeFi use cases, such as lowering spread fees, enabling bots for liquidation and limit orders, and boosting liquidity pool rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.

### Tokenomics and Growth
*   **Deflationary GNS Token**
    [[gains_network_tokenomics_and_statistics | GNS tokenomics]] are designed to be deflationary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. If the trading pool exceeds 110% capitalization, excess DAI is used to buy and burn GNS tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. If the pool falls below 100%, GNS is minted and sold for DAI to top it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. This creates buying pressure on GNS if more traders lose than win, which statistically has been the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. The current inflation rate for GNS is -25%, indicating deflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.
*   **Strong Growth Metrics**
    [[gains_network_tokenomics_and_statistics | Gains Network]] has accumulated approximately $2.8 million in fees since its inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>, with accelerated growth from December to February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. The platform has an accumulated trade volume of $5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a> and a growing number of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. These metrics suggest the project may have found product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.
*   **User-Friendly Interface**
    The G-Trade platform features a simple UI, allowing users to easily set collateral, leverage (up to 150x), stop loss, and take profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. A Polygon testnet version is available for practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.
*   **Staking Opportunities**
    Users can contribute liquidity to the GNS DAI pool and the trading pool, with the trading pool offering a 10% APY and the liquidity pool offering 47% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.

### Future Roadmap
The roadmap includes adding more crypto assets, GNS single-staking, multi-chain expansion, and plans to venture into a decentralized casino <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. The potential for multi-chain expansion could help attract significant liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>.

### Community
[[gains_network_overview | Gains Network]] has a vibrant Discord community and can be followed on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.

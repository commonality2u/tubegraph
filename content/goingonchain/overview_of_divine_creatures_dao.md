Divine Creatures DAO (DC DAO) is an upcoming OlympusDAO fork designed with a unique twist, aiming to become a "treasury of treasuries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. The platform's application was not yet launched at the time of this overview, but a preview of its functionalities was available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

## Core Mechanisms

Like other OlympusDAO forks, DC DAO allows users to bond or mint its native token, EGS, at a discount and stake it to earn interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. In its initial phase, the projected APY is around 50,000% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.

### Treasury Building

The primary goal of DC DAO is to build a robust treasury by accumulating assets from other prominent DAOs, such as wMEMO, OHM, and MIN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>.

### Integrated Decentralized Exchange (DEX)

The unique twist of DC DAO is its plan to build an integrated DEX filled with assets from its treasury, including wMEMO, OHM, Hector (HEC), and Exodia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>. This DEX will allow users to swap tokens:

*   **Token Cycle:** After an EGS rebase, users can swap EGS for wMEMO, then wMEMO for OHM, then OHM for Hector, and so forth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
*   **Potential Returns:** The team estimates that one full cycle could yield approximately 3.78% in returns, and performing this three times a day could result in about 11.34% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:07">[01:22:07]</a>.
*   **Automation:** While currently a manual process, the team is exploring ways to automate this swapping cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:07">[01:23:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. This would address the current issue of high slippage due to lack of deep liquidity for such multi-swaps across different platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.
*   **Revenue Model:** Swap fees generated from the DEX will flow into the DC DAO treasury, potentially helping to fund the EGS staking APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:03">[01:44:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:07">[01:53:07]</a>.

## Initial NFT Offering (INO) Launch

DC DAO plans an "Initial NFT Offering" for its launch, where users must purchase an NFT to gain an allocation for the EGS token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. This NFT sale will be conducted via an auction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:07">[02:10:07]</a>.

### NFT Tiers and Benefits

There are three NFT tiers, each offering specific benefits:

*   **God Tier:** The highest tier, with a starting bid of 4200 FTM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:05">[02:16:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:04">[02:22:04]</a>.
*   **Dante Tier:** For example, a Dante NFT purchased for 500 FTM would grant a maximum allocation of 600 FTM worth of EGS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:08">[02:24:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:02">[02:31:02]</a>.
    *   Special boosts for Dante tier holders include a 2.5% staking boost and a 5% bonding boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:08">[02:45:08]</a>.
    *   NFT holders also participate in a lottery, where a "Bronze Dante" NFT, for instance, could grant an additional 25% allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:04">[02:47:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
*   **Damning God Tier** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:04">[02:18:04]</a>

## Tokenomics

*   **Distribution:** 80% of the EGS token offering will go to the public through the NFT auction, indicating a significant public distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:03">[03:01:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
*   **Team Allocation:** 10% of tokens are reserved for the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.
*   **Initial Liquidity:** 10% is allocated for initial liquidity supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.
*   **Team Vesting:** Team tokens have a six-month vesting period with a two-month cliff, which some view as a relatively short vesting schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

## Team and Partnerships

The DC DAO team members are anonymous but claim to have diverse experience, including backgrounds in banking, science, and law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. DC DAO has partnered with SpiritSwap, with one of SpiritSwap's members serving as a multi-sig signer for DC DAO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

## Considerations

*   **Pros:**
    *   The concept is particularly interesting for users seeking high rebates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
    *   The high percentage of token sales going to the public (80%) is viewed favorably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.
    *   NFT benefits such as allocation bonuses, staking boosts, and bonding boosts are considered strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.
*   **Cons:**
    *   A desire for more utility beyond the initial benefits for the NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.
    *   The team is anonymous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.
    *   The team's token vesting period is considered somewhat short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

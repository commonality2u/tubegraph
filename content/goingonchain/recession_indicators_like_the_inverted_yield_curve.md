Economic signals can provide insights into potential market downturns. One such indicator is the inverted yield curve.

## The Inverted Yield Curve

The inverted yield curve is recognized as a signal of an impending recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This occurs in a market where there has been consistent selling activity, particularly since [[interest_rate_hikes_and_market_impacts | interest rate hikes]] began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Federal Reserve Policy and Market Impact

The actions of the Federal Reserve (Fed) are closely watched as they can significantly impact market liquidity and sentiment.

### Fed Tightening and Reduced Equity
The Fed's objective is to reduce inflation, and they are committed to raising rates until this goal is achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. A key reasoning shared by some analysts is that "fighting the Fed" is unwise due to the fact that Fed tightening reduces equity in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

### Market Irrationality
Despite signals, the market can remain irrational for longer than individuals can stay solvent, suggesting that further selling could occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

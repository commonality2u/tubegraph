A decentralized exchange (DEX) is a platform that allows users to trade tokens without a central intermediary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Examples include PancakeSwap and SushiSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Beyond trading, users can also become a liquidity provider (LP) to earn a portion of the trading fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## DEX Token Utilities

Typical utilities for a DEX token include:
*   **Governance Power:** Allowing holders to participate in the decision-making process of the exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   **Staking for Yield:** Staking tokens to earn more yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Launchpad Participation:** Staking tokens to take part in new project launchpads (Initial Farm Offerings or IFOs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

Several parties interact within a DEX ecosystem:

### Traders
Traders seek to trade a variety of protocol tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. They look for low slippage and good liquidity when executing trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The DEX earns a cut of the trading fees from these transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### Protocols
Protocols aim to set up their liquidity pools in places with high liquidity, similar to how companies list on exchanges with more trading activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. High liquidity is crucial for protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Liquidity Providers (LPs)
LPs help to provide the necessary liquidity for the DEX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. By providing liquidity, LPs earn a cut of the fees and can receive additional incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. For example, providing liquidity for a specific token pair might require purchasing the token to participate in a liquidity pool, benefiting both the protocol and the DEX by improving liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Stakers
Stakers either acquire DEX tokens from the open market or farm them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. They then stake these tokens to earn more yield or participate in IFOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Stakers can earn more DEX tokens through this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Challenges of DEX Token Investment

The speaker notes that many participants, including LPs and stakers, are "farming" DEX tokens through incentives rather than buying them from the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This creates misaligned incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

When the market enters a period of fear, these participants are likely to "dump" their farmed DEX tokens first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This behavior is evident in the price charts of tokens like Cake (PancakeSwap) and Sushi (SushiSwap) during market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. For this reason, the speaker avoids buying DEX tokens, preferring to farm them instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Emerging Changes

However, the dynamics for DEX tokens are evolving, with more people becoming willing to hold them due to a development known as [[crypto_bribes_in_decentralized_exchanges | crypto bribes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This concept will be explored further in a subsequent discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

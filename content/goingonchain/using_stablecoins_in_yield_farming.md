[[Yield farming to grow cryptocurrency | Yield farming]] can involve using stablecoins, which some people consider a less volatile strategy compared to using other cryptocurrency assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>.

## Benefits of Stablecoin Yield Farming

The primary advantage of using [[Types of Stablecoins | stablecoins]] in [[Stablecoin leveraged yield farming | yield farming]] is that they are not exposed to asset pricing fluctuations, as they are typically tied to one dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. This contrasts with scenarios where both the farming token and the liquidity pool assets can significantly drop in value, leading to substantial losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>.

For example, on a platform like Guys Farm, [[Dollar Stablecoin and Farming Opportunities | dollar stablecoin]] offerings include:
*   USDT with an 8% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>
*   DAI with a 5% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>
*   USDC with a 4.2% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>

This approach allows investors to "sit comfortably" and earn passive income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>.

> [!info] Price Stability
> With stablecoins, even if the price of the farming token (e.g., Guys token) drops significantly from $10 to $2, the value of the principal investment remains stable because the underlying asset is pegged to the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>.

## Considerations for Stablecoin Yield Farming

While stablecoin farming offers stability, it typically yields slower returns compared to highly volatile liquidity pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>. To generate a "significant" return or "degen" (engage in high-risk, high-reward farming), one needs a substantial capital investment, such as a five-digit amount like $20,000 or $30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>.

> [!warning] Capital Requirements
> Engaging in [[Comparison of yield farming on stablecoin platforms | stablecoin yield farming]] with smaller capital may not be as profitable, as the earnings can be "very slow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>.

### Contrast with Non-Stablecoin Farming
In contrast to stablecoin farming, liquidity pools involving volatile assets (e.g., a Guys token and FTM liquidity pool) carry a "triple hit" risk where:
1.  The price of the farming token decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.
2.  The Annual Percentage Yield (APY) drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>.
3.  The overall value of the liquidity pool diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>.

This combination can lead to significant losses, as experienced when the Guys token dropped from $8 to $1.95 and the liquidity pool value dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.

The rapid "capital fleeing" from new platforms can also be faster than anticipated, with funds quickly moving to other opportunities like Harmony's liquidity mining programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>. This necessitates constant monitoring if not using stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>.

Cidadao is a platform that integrates blockchain technology with real estate, distinct from other DeFi projects as it is backed by a physical asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The platform identifies commercial building owners interested in bringing their properties on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Introducing Real Estate On-chain (IRO) Process

The core mechanism for integrating real estate is called "Introducing Real Estate On-chain" (IRO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

### Commitment Phase
During an IRO, participants commit [[usdb_stablecoin_and_its_mechanics | USDC]] into a pool over a specified duration, typically 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. A minimum sum needs to be met by the participants for the IRO to be successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Once committed, the [[usdb_stablecoin_and_its_mechanics | USDC]] cannot be withdrawn until the IRO concludes (either successfully or unsuccessfully) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

The first project, the Cardiff building, has an IRO value of approximately $21 million, which is the amount that needs to be met by commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Detailed property information, including fair value, stable income, and rental income, is provided on a dedicated page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Reward Distribution
If the IRO is successful and the minimum sum is met, tokens and rewards are distributed to participants, signifying the integration of DeFi principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The IRO reward for the Cardiff building is approximately $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

Rewards are distributed proportionally based on commitment. For example, if the daily reward is $1,000, a participant committing $1,000, when no one else commits, would receive 100% of the daily reward ($1,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. However, if another participant commits $9,000, bringing the total committed to $10,000, the initial participant's $1,000 commitment represents 10% of the total, entitling them to 10% of the daily reward ($100) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

The platform provides these IRO rewards directly to participants and supporters instead of paying fees to third-party agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Post-IRO Outcomes
*   **Successful IRO**: If the project passes, the committed [[usdb_stablecoin_and_its_mechanics | USDC]] is swapped for Real Estate Token (RET) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Participants also receive their rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. RET can be sold on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap or used to earn KNIGHT, Cidadao's governance token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Owning KNIGHT provides exposure to other properties listed on the platform, as Cidadao collects 2% of all listed properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Unsuccessful IRO**: If the minimum sum is not met, the funds are refunded back to the participants, and the property is not brought on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Participants receive a refund of their commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Regulatory Responses to Stablecoin Instability

The volatility experienced by [[stablecoin_vulnerabilities | stablecoins]] like UST has drawn the attention of regulators, leading to calls for increased oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

### Treasury Secretary's Call for Regulation
Following the de-pegging of UST and the subsequent panic in the market, the Treasury Secretary explicitly addressed UST and called for its regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. This intervention occurred amidst broader macro-economic concerns, including high inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

### Impact of Instability
The de-pegging of UST, which saw its value drop, directly contributed to the decline in Luna's price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. The market instability was further exacerbated by a brief moment where USDT [[stablecoin_vulnerabilities | stablecoin]] also lost its peg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. These events underscore the fragility within the [[types_of_stablecoins | stablecoin]] ecosystem and highlight the urgency for regulatory frameworks.

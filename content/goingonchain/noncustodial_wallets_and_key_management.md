Recent events in the crypto space highlight the critical importance of [[importance_of_storing_crypto_assets_safely | self-custody]] of digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The principle "not your key, not your coin" underscores the need to remove assets from centralized exchanges (CeX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

On October 21st, Crypto.com sent 220,000 ETH to Gate.io <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Crypto.com's CEO stated it was a mistake and that the funds were recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This incident, however, fueled speculation about exchanges potentially transferring assets to assist with proof of reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Gate.io clarified that their proof of reserves from October 19th did not include the Crypto.com deposit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, but this did not prevent user withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## The Importance of Self-Custody

A significant percentage of individuals do not know how to properly store their crypto tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Non-custodial wallets are essential for maintaining direct control over one's assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. With non-custodial wallets, users are solely responsible for managing their private keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Losing these keys means permanent loss of all assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

Non-custodial wallets offer greater control, allowing users to add custom networks and configurations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Types of Non-Custodial Wallets

When choosing a non-custodial wallet, it's generally recommended to use a [[comparison_between_hot_wallets_and_cold_wallets | cold wallet]] for optimal [[security_measures_for_cryptocurrency_wallets | security]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

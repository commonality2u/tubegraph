The [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] campaign was paused due to a significant surge in gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. At one point, a single swap cost approximately $21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This was problematic as Layer 2 (L2) solutions are designed to offer cheaper gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## What is Arbitrum Nitro?

[[nitro_upgrade_for_arbitrum | Nitro]] is described as an "accelerated version of Arbitrum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Its primary purpose is to alleviate heavy loads on the chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, thereby reducing gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Impact on Arbitrum Odyssey

The [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] campaign will resume after the launch of [[nitro_upgrade_for_arbitrum | Nitro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This upgrade is expected to resolve the gas fee issues that led to the campaign's temporary halt.

This article explores the Kujira project, its strategic investors, and its upcoming Initial DEX Offering (IDO). Kujira provides a platform that allows users to acquire Luna at a discounted price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This discounted Luna primarily comes from liquidations, such as those occurring when users take loans against bLuna collateral on platforms like Anchor Protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. When a loan's Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio exceeds 60%, the bLuna collateral is liquidated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

Historically, this liquidated Luna was typically acquired by "whales" or "bots" through liquidation auctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Kujira's [[ocra_kujira_platform_for_buying_liquidated_bluna | OCRA platform]] now enables retail investors to participate and bid for this liquidated bLuna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Strategic Investors and Partners

The Kujira team has garnered support from strong investors and partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This backing is considered an interesting insight into the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Upcoming Initial DEX Offering (IDO)

Kujira is scheduled to conduct its IDO on November 12th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

While the concept of strong investors might not seem highly exciting in a bull market, Kujira's mechanism could offer opportunities to pick up good deals when market conditions shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This aligns with certain [[cryptocurrency_investment_strategies | investment strategies]] focusing on market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

Holders of LUNA can [[using_terra_luna_to_earn_more_luna | use it to earn more luna]] and receive airdrops by staking their LUNA tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## How to Stake LUNA

To stake LUNA, follow these steps within your Terra wallet:
1.  Navigate to the "staking" section in your Terra wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.
2.  A list of validators will appear, initially sorted by uptime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. You can change the sorting criteria to commission or voting power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. There are 105 validators available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

### Choosing a Validator

When selecting a validator, consider the following factors:
*   **Decentralization** It is generally not recommended to stake with the top 5 validators to avoid concentrating power at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Self-Delegation** This figure indicates the amount the validator has delegated to themselves, demonstrating their "skin in the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. A higher self-delegation amount is often preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Commission** This is the percentage of your rewards that the validator retains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Look for validators with 0% commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Uptime** Validators should ideally have 100% uptime, as you only earn rewards when they are actively working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Delegating Your LUNA

Once you have chosen a validator:
1.  Click "delegate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
2.  Input the desired amount of LUNA you wish to stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
3.  Click "next" and then "go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

After delegation, you can view a summary of your delegated amount and the rewards you are earning within your wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

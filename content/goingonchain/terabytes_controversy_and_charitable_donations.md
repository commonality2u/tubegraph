During a period of heightened NFT activity on Terra, characterized by numerous project launches including Galaxy Punk fetching good prices on the secondary market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, two significant incidents occurred that served as cautionary tales for [[crypto_scam_awareness | crypto scam awareness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. One of these involved a project known as Terabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Incident Overview

The artist behind the Terabytes project reportedly ceased operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, deleting all associated social media accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Charitable Action

Despite the artist's withdrawal, all funds associated with the Terabytes project were donated to the Angel Protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Unsubstantiated Narratives

Two different stories emerged regarding the Terabytes incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>:
*   One suggestion was that public discontent with the quality of the artist's work led to their departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   Another narrative claimed that the artwork itself was generated using a "pixel dupe maker," which can create pixel drawings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

Regardless of the specific reasons, the Terabytes project, like another project called Kara Waifu, is no longer active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. These events underscore the critical importance of conducting one's own research before engaging with any new projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

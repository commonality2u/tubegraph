Rabby is a Chrome extension [[types_of_crypto_wallets | wallet]] developed by Debank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## User Experience

While Rabby claims to offer a smooth multi-chain experience, the speaker noted issues during testing, such as the [[types_of_crypto_wallets | wallet]] sometimes misidentifying the active chain when visiting a Fantom site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Security Features

A significant feature of Rabby [[types_of_crypto_wallets | wallet]] is its comprehensive [[security_features_of_crypto_wallets | security]] section, particularly its token approval management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Token Approval Management
Rabby provides a list of all token approvals a user has made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This allows users to see which protocols have been granted access to their tokens, including "infinite" (unlimited) access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. If a project with infinite access is compromised, the user's funds could be affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Rabby enables users to decline or revoke these approvals, a feature not available in Metamask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

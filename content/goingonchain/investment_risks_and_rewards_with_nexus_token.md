The Nexus Protocol on Terra offers a unique arbitrage opportunity involving its liquid Pylon pool, which provides [[token_distribution_and_rewards | Nexus token]] rewards for [[investing_in_cryptocurrency | cryptocurrency]] deposits. This opportunity is linked to a temporary de-peg of a receipt token known as bPSI-DP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## The Liquid Pylon Pool

The liquid Pylon pool on Terra requires users to deposit UST for a 24-month lock-up period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. During this period, depositors earn [[token_distribution_and_rewards | Nexus token]] as a reward, with a stated annual percentage rate (APR) of approximately 15.73% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This mechanism behaves like a bond: a deposit of 1,000 UST is expected to yield 1,000 UST back plus accumulated rewards at the end of the term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

Unlike regular Pylon pools, the liquid Pylon pool issues a receipt token called bPSI-DP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This bPSI-DP token can be traded on Terraswap, allowing users to exit their position before the 24-month lock-up expires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Arbitrage Opportunity: The bPSI-DP De-peg

Currently, the bPSI-DP token is experiencing a de-peg, trading at a discount compared to the UST it represents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. For example, a deposit of 100 UST might yield 128 bPSI-DP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This means a 100 UST deposit is recorded as 128.973 UST deposited in Pylon, representing a de-peg of about 28% to 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This discrepancy presents an arbitrage opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The de-peg might be attributed to a bearish market causing increased selling activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## [[Investment strategies | Investment Strategies]] and [[Risks associated with new investment platforms | Risks]]

To take advantage of this situation, investors need to be bullish on the [[token_distribution_and_rewards | Nexus token]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

There are two potential [[investment_strategies_and_tokenomics_of_radiant_capital | strategies]]:

1.  **Waiting for Re-peg:** One approach is to acquire bPSI-DP at its de-pegged price and wait for it to return to its intended 1:1 peg with UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. If the peg is restored, the bPSI-DP can then be swapped back to UST at a profit.
2.  **Long-Term Hold with Nexus Rewards:** In a scenario where the de-peg persists, investors can choose to hold the bPSI-DP for the full 24-month duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. After 24 months, the original deposited UST amount will be returned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. During this holding period, the investor also earns [[token_distribution_and_rewards | Nexus token]] rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### [[Risks associated with new investment platforms | Investment Risks]]

*   **Long Waiting Period:** A significant risk is the 24-month lock-up period if the de-peg does not resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. In the volatile world of crypto, "24 months is a very, very, very long wait" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   **Nexus Token Price Volatility:** The profitability of the long-term hold strategy relies on the appreciation or stability of the [[token_distribution_and_rewards | Nexus token]] price, as these tokens are the primary reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

This arbitrage opportunity is seen as interesting due to the current market conditions which have led to the bPSI-DP de-peg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

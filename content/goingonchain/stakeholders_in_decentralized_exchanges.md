A [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | decentralized exchange]] (DEX) serves as a platform where users can trade their tokens and also become a liquidity provider to earn a portion of trading fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Examples include PancakeSwap and SushiSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The typical utilities for a DEX token are governance power, staking for yield, or participation in launchpads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

Key stakeholders in a DEX ecosystem include:

## Traders
Traders seek to trade a variety of protocol tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Their primary concerns are low slippage and good liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. When a trade occurs, the DEX earns a cut of the trading fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Protocols
Protocols look for platforms with high liquidity to set up their pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Similar to how a company might list on SGX (Singapore Exchange) for more liquidity, protocols choose DEXs with a high liquidity environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Liquidity Providers
Liquidity providers (LPs) are crucial as they help facilitate the high liquidity that protocols desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. By providing liquidity for specific pairs (e.g., FIGHT and BUSD), LPs can earn more yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This also benefits the protocol, as users might need to buy their token to participate in a liquidity pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. LPs earn a portion of the fees and often receive additional incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Stakers
Stakers are participants who either purchase DEX tokens from the open market or obtain them through farming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. They then stake these tokens to earn more yield or to take part in Initial Farm Offerings (IFOs), for example, by staking CAKE tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Stakers also have the potential to earn more DEX tokens through staking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Incentives and Market Behavior
Both liquidity providers and stakers are often involved in farming DEX tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. If these tokens are acquired through incentives rather than bought from the open market, there is a tendency for these participants to dump their DEX tokens first when market fear sets in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This misalignment of incentives, as seen in the price behavior of tokens like CAKE and SUSHI during market downturns, is a reason some individuals avoid buying DEX tokens, preferring to farm them instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

However, the landscape for DEX tokens is evolving, with more people becoming willing to hold them, partly due to phenomena like [[crypto_bribes_in_decentralized_exchanges | crypto bribes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

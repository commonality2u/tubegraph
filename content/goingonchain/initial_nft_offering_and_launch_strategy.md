DC Dao is implementing an "initial NFT offering" for its launch strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:06">[02:03:06]</a>. This method requires users to purchase an NFT to receive an allocation for the project's token, EGS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>. The NFT sale will be conducted as an auction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:04">[02:10:04]</a>. This approach is considered an interesting way to launch compared to other Olympus Dao forks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">[02:56:06]</a>.

## NFT Tiers and Benefits

There are three tiers of NFTs in the initial offering: God, Dante, and Damning God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:04">[02:14:04]</a>.
*   **God Tier** is the highest tier, with a starting bid of 4200 FTM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:07">[02:19:07]</a>.
*   **Dante Tier** provides specific benefits and allocation examples:
    *   If a Dante NFT is acquired at 500 FTM, it awards a maximum of 600 FTM worth of EGS token allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:08">[02:24:08]</a>.
    *   Assuming FTM is $3 and EGS is $1 at pre-sale, owning a Dante tier NFT allows the option to buy $1920 worth of EGS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:02">[02:31:02]</a>.
    *   Holders of the Dante tier receive special boosts: a 2.5% increase in staking rewards and a 5% bonding boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:04">[02:41:04]</a>.
    *   Possessing a Dante NFT also enters the holder into a lottery. For example, a "bronze Dante" can grant an additional 25% allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:09">[02:47:09]</a>.

## Tokenomics and Distribution

A significant portion of the token offering is allocated to the NFT auction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:02">[03:02:02]</a>.
*   **80%** of the offering will go to the NFT auction, meaning a large portion of tokens will be distributed to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.
*   **10%** is reserved for the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.
*   **10%** is for the initial liquidity supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

The team's tokens have a vesting period of six months with a two-month cliff, which is considered a relatively short vesting period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:09">[03:17:09]</a>.

## General Observations

The initial NFT offering concept is seen as interesting, particularly for users seeking rebates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. The idea of 80% of token sales going to the public is also favored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. While the NFT benefits like allocation bonuses and staking/bonding boosts are positive, more utility for the NFTs would be desirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Concerns include the anonymous nature of the team and the short vesting period for team tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

Finblox is presented as an alternative platform for parking stablecoins, offering competitive rates compared to Hodlnaut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Interest Rates

*   **Stablecoins**
    *   Finblox offers 15% APY on USDC and USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, which is higher than Hodlnaut's highest USDT rate of 13.86% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
    *   Finblox also accepts SGD Coin (XSGD) at 6.5% APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, a rate that no bank in Singapore can match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Other Cryptocurrencies (Finblox)**
    *   Finblox offers high APY rates for other cryptocurrencies, including Avalanche (AVAX) at 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, Polygon (MATIC) at 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, and AXS at 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Tiered Rates**
    *   Hodlnaut's interest rates are tiered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, while Finblox's rates are not tiered at the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## [[interest_payout_schedules_in_finblox_vs_hodlnaut | Interest Payout Schedules]]

*   Hodlnaut pays interest weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   Finblox pays interest daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Platform Access and Interface

*   Finblox currently only offers an app interface, with no web interface available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   The Finblox app interface is described as being "pretty similar to Hodlnaut," including features like a "saving board" and "crypto vault" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Deposit Options and Fees

*   Hodlnaut primarily uses the ERC20 chain for deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   Finblox integrates with Solana, BNB, and Polygon chains, which generally result in cheaper transfer fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
    *   However, if minting XSGD to deposit into Finblox, the transfer is still on ERC20, incurring higher fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
    *   For depositing MATIC, Finblox allows direct use of the Polygon chain, offering cheaper gas fees compared to ERC20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## [[platform_risk_and_security_concerns_with_finblox | Platform Risk and Security Concerns]]

*   Hodlnaut has received in-principle approval, suggesting a level of vetting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   Finblox is a newer platform, and at the time of signing up, there was no KYC (Know Your Customer) process required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This implies a higher platform risk compared to Hodlnaut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

[[speculation_on_arbitrum_token_eligibility | Speculation]] exists regarding a potential airdrop for Arbitrum, a Layer 2 solution with the highest Total Value Locked (TVL) that currently does not have its own token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Reasons for Speculation

One significant reason for the [[speculation_on_arbitrum_token_eligibility | speculation]] is the precedent set by its competitor, [[optimism_and_arbitrum_airdrops | Optimism]], which previously released an airdrop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Potential Eligibility Criteria

Learning from the [[optimism_and_arbitrum_airdrops | Optimism]] airdrop's eligibility criteria, it is believed that potential requirements for an Arbitrum airdrop could include:
*   [[Bridging to Arbitrum | Bridging]] assets over to the Arbitrum network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   Using the Arbitrum network for a sustained period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   Engaging in transactions as an early user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Connection to [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]]

The [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey program]], an eight-week initiative, invites users to [[Bridging to Arbitrum | bridge]] assets and test different protocols on the Arbitrum network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. As part of this program, participants are rewarded with unique NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. There is also [[speculation_on_arbitrum_token_eligibility | speculation]] that participation in the [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] could lead to an airdrop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] was anticipated to go live in mid-June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Potential Benefits and Risks

> [!INFO] Potential Benefits
> *   Receiving unique NFTs through the [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
> *   The opportunity for an Arbitrum airdrop, which is considered a positive outcome, especially during a bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Potential Risks
> The primary risk involves potentially wasting gas fees on transactions if no airdrop materializes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Bridging Considerations

Users have already begun [[Bridging to Arbitrum | bridging]] assets to Arbitrum in anticipation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Official Bridge:** Using the official "bridge.arbitrum.io" involves bridging time, and returning assets from Layer 2 (L2) to Layer 1 (L1) can take approximately eight days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Hop Exchange:** This platform offers a solution for faster withdrawals, allowing users to retrieve their ETH immediately for a small fee when transferring from Arbitrum back to the mainnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Centralized Exchanges (CEXs):** Binance, CDC, and KuCoin offer direct [[Bridging to Arbitrum | bridging]] to Arbitrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. It is currently unclear if bridging from exchanges will be considered equivalent to using the official bridge for airdrop eligibility, and further details are expected for "Week 1" of the [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

While the official [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey program]] has concluded, users are engaging in a new quest-to-earn-roles program on the Arbitrum Discord server, driven by ongoing [[arbitrum_airdrop_speculation | speculation on Arbitrum token eligibility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This program aims to grant participants various roles within the Discord community upon completion of specific tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Background: Arbitrum Odyssey

Previously, Arbitrum initiated the [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey program]], an eight-week event that offered NFTs for completing tasks like [[bridging_to_arbitrum | bridging to Arbitrum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This program was halted due to excessive network traffic and increased gas prices, largely attributed to users participating for [[arbitrum_airdrop_speculation | airdrop speculation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The [[nitro_upgrade_for_arbitrum | Nitro upgrade]] was introduced to address these scalability issues and went live on August 31st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Despite the upgrade, the original [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey program]] has not returned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Current Quest for Discord Roles

The current program, accessible via `guild.xyz/arbitrum`, involves connecting your wallet, Discord account, and Twitter handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Although the program explicitly states it's only for Discord roles, approximately 50,000 people have participated due to persistent [[arbitrum_airdrop_speculation | airdrop speculation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The estimated cost for participation is around 0.02 ETH plus gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Task Completion Guide

Most tasks require purchasing small amounts of specific tokens, such as 0.01 JMX or 0.001 of other tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

*   **Where to Buy Tokens**: Tokens can typically be acquired on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap or SushiSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Safety Tip for Token Purchases**: To avoid scam tokens, it is recommended to copy the token's contract address directly from an explorer (like Arbiscan) and paste it into the DEX, rather than searching by name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Arbitrum Odyssey Task**: For users aiming to complete every task, including the defunct [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] related ones, it may require purchasing an NFT from the external marketplace "extra toast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

After making the required purchases, returning to Guild.xyz will refresh the page and grant access to the respective Discord roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The entire process can take around 30 minutes to complete manually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

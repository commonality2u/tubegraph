During times of market volatility and rising interest rates, it is crucial to make crypto assets work harder to cover expenses like mortgage interest [00:00:11]. This requires a strategic approach to [[managing_crypto_investments_during_rapid_market_changes | managing crypto investments]].

## Challenges with Centralized Finance (CeFi) Platforms

Currently, many centralized finance (CeFi) platforms have faced significant issues, with some being exposed to failures like Terra or 3AC [00:00:25]. These platforms have either halted withdrawals or gone bankrupt [00:00:31]. For example, some investors have withdrawn assets from services like Hodlnaut and Vauld (Finblox) due to these concerns [00:00:36]. While removing assets ensures safety, it also means they are no longer earning yield [00:00:44].

## Strategies for Earning Yield and Managing Risk

To mitigate risks while still earning interest, a mixed approach combining different strategies can be beneficial [00:01:59].

### 1. Parking Assets on Exchanges (CeFi)
Many crypto exchanges offer services to lend out [[investing_in_cryptocurrency | crypto assets]] to earn interest [00:00:53].
*   **KuCoin:** Users can lend out crypto assets for terms like 7 or 14 days to earn interest [00:00:56]. KuCoin Earn allows parking stablecoins or Bitcoin to earn a certain APR, with flexible or fixed tenures [00:01:10].
*   **FTX App:** The FTX app offers a simpler interface primarily for buying, selling, depositing, and withdrawing [00:02:17]. Transfers of ERC20 tokens from FTX Pro to FTX are free [00:02:32].
    *   **APY:** The platform offers an Annual Percentage Yield (APY), for instance, 6.1% on USD (USDC) and Ethereum [00:02:54]. The first $10,000 typically earns 8%, with subsequent amounts dropping to 5% [00:02:59].
    *   **Withdrawals:** Users who have not completed Know Your Customer (KYC) verification can withdraw a maximum of $2,000 [00:03:25]. Withdrawals can be made via international wire transfer to a bank account or directly to crypto wallets like MetaMask, with withdrawal fees often being free [00:03:31].

> [!CAUTION] Platform Risk
>
> It is crucial to understand that parking assets on exchanges is **not risk-free** [00:03:59]. If the platform, such as FTX, experiences a collapse or halts withdrawals, all assets stored on it could be lost [00:04:03]. This is a significant consideration when developing a [[crypto_portfolio_strategy | crypto portfolio strategy]].

### 2. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Staking
Another option is to participate in [[risks_and_considerations_in_defi_investments | DeFi]] through liquid staking [00:01:30].
*   **Ethereum Staking:** Platforms like Lido or Rocket Pool allow users to stake Ethereum (ETH) to earn rewards, typically around 4% [00:01:33]. Running your own node can yield even higher rewards [00:01:41].

### 3. Self-Custody (Safest)
The safest approach is to store assets in a personal wallet and wait for crypto asset price appreciation [00:01:47]. This adheres to the principle: "your keys, your coin; not your keys, not your coin" [00:01:55], emphasizing the [[importance_of_storing_crypto_assets_safely | importance of storing crypto assets safely]].

## Understanding the Origin of Yield

It's important to question where the yield (e.g., 6.1% or 8%) comes from [00:04:11]. While there isn't always a fixed answer, potential explanations include:
*   **Lending to the platform:** Assets might be lent to the exchange platform (e.g., FTX) for margin trading and lending activities [00:04:32].
*   **Source of liquidity:** Funds could be used as a source of liquidity for lending and borrowing services available on platforms like FTX Pro [00:04:44].
*   **Marketing dollars:** The yield might also be partially funded by marketing budgets as a way to attract users to the platform [00:04:53].

## Key Considerations and Risk Management

> [!WARNING] Not Risk-Free
>
> Regardless of the method, investing in crypto and earning yield is **not risk-free** [00:05:00]. Platform risk remains a significant concern [00:05:06].

To manage these risks, it is advisable to practice prudent risk management and diversify assets [00:05:11]. By spreading investments across different strategies, such as a mix of exchanges, DeFi, and self-custody, investors can still have some assets earning yield while mitigating overall exposure [00:05:14].

During volatile times in the crypto market, especially with rising interest rates, it is important to make assets work harder, for instance, to cover mortgage interest [00:00:11]. One way to potentially earn yield on crypto assets is by parking them in centralized exchanges (CEXs) [00:00:53].

## Current Landscape and Challenges
Many centralized finance (CeFi) platforms have faced issues, including withdrawal freezes or bankruptcy, due to exposures to events like Terra or 3AC [00:00:25]. This has led some users to withdraw their assets from services like Hodlnaut and Finblox [00:00:36], which then means those assets are no longer earning yield [00:00:44].

## How Centralized Exchange Lending Works
Many crypto exchanges offer services that allow users to lend out their crypto assets in return for interest [00:01:25].

### KuCoin Example
KuCoin provides a lending service where users can lend out crypto assets for terms like seven or fourteen days [00:00:59]. Additionally, KuCoin offers "KuCoin Earn," where users can park stablecoins or Bitcoin to earn a certain Annual Percentage Rate (APR) [00:01:10]. The tenure for these earnings can be flexible or fixed [00:01:18].

### FTX Example
The FTX App (distinct from FTX Pro) is an example of a platform used for parking assets to earn yield [00:02:06].

#### FTX App Features
*   **Simple Interface**: The FTX App is designed with a straightforward interface, primarily for buying, selling, depositing, and withdrawing assets, without a complex trading interface [00:02:17].
*   **Transfers**: Transfers of ERC-20 tokens from FTX Pro to the FTX App are free [00:02:28]. For example, USDC transferred from FTX Pro to the FTX App via ERC-20 incurs no deposit fees [00:02:37].
*   **Yield Structure**: The Annual Percentage Yield (APY) can vary [00:02:52]. For instance, an APY of 8% might be offered for the first $10,000, with subsequent amounts earning 5%, potentially resulting in an overall APY of 6.1% for larger balances [00:02:57]. This yield applies to various assets, including Ethereum [00:03:16].
*   **Withdrawals**:
    *   Un-KYC'd (Know Your Customer) accounts may have a maximum withdrawal limit of $2,000 [00:03:25].
    *   Users can initiate international wire transfers directly to bank accounts that accept foreign currency (e.g., USD) [00:03:31].
    *   USDC can be withdrawn to [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | MetaMask]] or other crypto wallets [00:03:44].
    *   Withdrawal fees are typically free when sending assets out [00:03:51].

## Sources of Yield
The exact source of the yield on centralized exchanges can be unclear, but common explanations include [00:04:11]:
*   **Lending to the Platform**: Users might be lending their assets directly to the platform (e.g., FTX), which then uses them for margin and lending services [00:04:32].
*   **Liquidity for Lending/Borrowing**: The assets could be used as a source of liquidity for internal lending and borrowing markets on the platform, such as those found on FTX Pro [00:04:44].
*   **Marketing Dollars**: The high yield could also be a marketing strategy to attract users to the platform [00:04:53].

## Risks
Using centralized exchanges for crypto lending is **not risk-free** [00:03:59]. The primary concern is **platform risk** [00:05:06]. If the centralized exchange experiences a halt in operations or withdrawals, or faces bankruptcy, users could lose all their assets stored on the platform [00:04:03]. Therefore, it is advisable to practice prudent risk management and diversify assets [00:05:11].

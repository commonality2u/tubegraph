As of the current update, the market is experiencing a bearish sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The portfolio is currently down by approximately 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Investment Strategy During Bear Market

The current [[crypto_portfolio_strategy | crypto portfolio strategy]] involves continuing to dollar-cost average (DCA) into strong projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The best time to accumulate assets is generally considered to be during a bear market, though investors must be prepared to "stomach the pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Using the DCA strategy helps avoid "catching the falling knife" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

A key observation supporting this strategy is that crypto adoption continues to grow, and there have been no changes in the underlying technology itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Specific Asset Updates

### Core Holdings

The portfolio continues to DCA into strong projects such as Bitcoin (BTC), Fantom (FTM), and Merit Circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

### Luna

Luna is being accumulated using the Anchor Protocol strategy previously shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Frog Nation (Spell, wMEMO, ICE)

Both wMEMO and Spell are held in the main and gem portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **wMEMO**: This asset was sold three days prior to the update and bought back again after a recent AMA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The strategy for wMEMO involves scripting each time there is an AMA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This is explicitly stated as not a long-term hold, and selling is expected soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Spell and ICE**: These assets are still being held, as they are believed to be good products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. However, the team dynamics are noted as "not so good," but their performance will continue to be monitored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Important Disclaimer

Always invest only with money that can be afforded to lose, as cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

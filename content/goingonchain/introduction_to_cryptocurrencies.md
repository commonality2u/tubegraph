[[introduction_to_cryptocurrency_lending_platforms | Cryptocurrencies]] are a form of digital payment that can be used for trading or in exchange for items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## How Blockchain Works in Cryptocurrency

The fundamental concept behind [[introduction_to_cryptocurrency_lending_platforms | cryptocurrency]] is blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. You can think of blockchain as a public database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. To ensure the authenticity of transactions, "validators" are necessary to check the blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This validation process ensures that all transactions recorded are legitimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### Blockchain Algorithms: Proof of Work vs. Proof of Stake

Within blockchain technology, two prevalent algorithms are Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

*   **Proof of Work (PoW)**
    *   This algorithm requires significant hardware and consumes a lot of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
    *   An example is [[investing_in_cryptocurrencies_like_bitcoin_ethereum_and_dogecoin | Bitcoin]] mining, where individuals purchase machines to validate transactions on the [[investing_in_cryptocurrencies_like_bitcoin_ethereum_and_dogecoin | Bitcoin]] network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

*   **Proof of Stake (PoS)**
    *   PoS is increasingly favored by protocols because it does not require dedicated hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
    *   Unlike PoW, PoS does not face issues related to high energy consumption or hardware requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
    *   To gain control of a Proof of Stake network, one would need to own 51% of the [[introduction_to_cryptocurrency_lending_platforms | cryptocurrency]] on that specific network, rather than just having a more powerful computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Coins vs. Tokens

The terms "coins" and "tokens" refer to different types of [[introduction_to_cryptocurrency_lending_platforms | cryptocurrencies]]:

*   **Coins**
    *   These are [[introduction_to_cryptocurrency_lending_platforms | cryptocurrencies]] that operate on their own independent blockchain or network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
    *   Examples include [[investing_in_cryptocurrencies_like_bitcoin_ethereum_and_dogecoin | Bitcoin]], which runs on the [[investing_in_cryptocurrencies_like_bitcoin_ethereum_and_dogecoin | Bitcoin]] network, and [[investing_in_cryptocurrencies_like_bitcoin_ethereum_and_dogecoin | Ethereum]], which runs on the [[investing_in_cryptocurrencies_like_bitcoin_ethereum_and_dogecoin | Ethereum]] network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

*   **Tokens**
    *   Tokens are [[introduction_to_cryptocurrency_lending_platforms | cryptocurrencies]] that do not have their own native blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
    *   Instead, they run on top of an existing blockchain, such as USDC or DAI, which operate on the [[investing_in_cryptocurrencies_like_bitcoin_ethereum_and_dogecoin | Ethereum]] chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

Cryptocurrencies operate on the concept of blockchain, which can be thought of as a public database [00:00:26]. Validators are required to check on and validate this database to ensure all transactions are real [00:00:29]. Within blockchain technology, there are two popular algorithms used for this validation: Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) [00:00:36].

## Proof of Work (PoW)

Proof of Work is an algorithm that requires significant computational effort. For example, when people talk about Bitcoin mining, they are referring to the use of hardware-intensive Proof of Work to validate transactions on the Bitcoin network [00:00:46]. This process typically involves purchasing machines and consumes a lot of energy [00:00:48].

## Proof of Stake (PoS)

Proof of Stake is an alternative algorithm that is increasingly being chosen by more protocols [00:00:41]. A key advantage of Proof of Stake over Proof of Work is that it does not require dedicated hardware [00:00:42]. This means it avoids the problems associated with high energy consumption and the need for specialized mining equipment [00:00:55].

### Security in Proof of Stake

On a Proof of Stake network, a user cannot simply gain control by possessing a more powerful computer [00:00:57]. Instead, to take over the network, one would need to own 51% of the cryptocurrency on that specific network [00:01:02].

Cryptocurrencies are a form of payment used for trading or exchanging items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. They operate on the concept of blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. You can think of blockchain as a public database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. [[Choosing validators for staking | Validators]] are essential to check and validate transactions, ensuring their authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Within blockchain, two popular algorithms are used: Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Proof of Work (PoW)

Proof of Work is an algorithm used by networks like Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. It involves a process known as "mining" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. To validate transactions on a Proof of Work network, participants (miners) must purchase specialized hardware and consume a significant amount of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Proof of Stake (PoS)

Proof of Stake is increasingly chosen by protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. A key advantage of PoS is that it does not require dedicated hardware for validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, avoiding the energy consumption and hardware costs associated with Proof of Work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

On a Proof of Stake network, an individual cannot take over the network simply by possessing a more powerful computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Instead, to gain control, one would need to own 51% of the cryptocurrency on that specific network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Coins vs. Tokens

It's important to distinguish between "coins" and "tokens" within the cryptocurrency landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>:

*   **Coins** are cryptocurrencies that operate on their own independent blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Examples include Bitcoin, which runs on the Bitcoin network, and Ethereum, which runs on the Ethereum network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Tokens** are cryptocurrencies that do not have their own native blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Instead, they run on top of an existing blockchain. For instance, USDC and DAI are tokens that operate on the Ethereum chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

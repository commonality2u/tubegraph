Tornado Cash is a service described as a "washing machine" for cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Its primary function is to enhance the privacy of crypto transactions.

## How it Works
Users deposit their crypto into Tornado Cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. After processing, the crypto exits from a destination that is untraceable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Use in Incidents
In one instance, following a phishing attack on OpenSea, a hacker's wallet shares indicated that stolen Ethereum (ETH) had been sent to Tornado Cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This attack affected 17 users who accidentally fell victim to the phishing scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The overall situation involving the hack and the use of Tornado Cash is currently under investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Such incidents underscore the importance of [[security_measures_for_nft_buyers | security measures for NFT buyers]] and general [[crypto_scam_awareness | crypto scam awareness]].

OCRA is a project designed to allow users to buy [[Luna Classic and new Luna token airdrop | Luna]] at a discounted price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It facilitates participation in the [[liquidation_and_bidding_process | liquidation]] auctions of bLuna, which was previously only accessible to large investors or bots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Background: bLuna Liquidation on Anchor Protocol

Users can take [[Anchor Protocol and bLuna Loans | loans via Anchor Protocol]] by depositing bLuna as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The recommended Loan-to-Value (LTV) is 45%, and [[liquidation_process_for_bluna | liquidation]] occurs if the LTV reaches 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

For example, if a user deposits 2 bLuna worth $100 (at $50 per bLuna), they can borrow $45 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. If bLuna drops to $30, the 2 bLuna collateral becomes worth $60, pushing the LTV to 75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This exceeds the 60% liquidation threshold, leading to the bLuna collateral being liquidated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The borrower keeps the $45 but loses their [[Luna Classic and new Luna token airdrop | Luna]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

Previously, this liquidated [[Luna Classic and new Luna token airdrop | Luna]] was acquired by large investors ("whales") or bots through liquidation auctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. These entities could bid at a discount to the market price, for instance, acquiring bLuna at $25 when the market price was $30, representing a 16.6% discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## OCRA Kujira Platform

OCRA Kujira enables retail users to participate in the bidding process for liquidated bLuna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Bidding Process
*   Users place bids by specifying a "premium" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   A higher premium means the user is willing to pay less for the bLuna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   To place a bid, users deposit their [[UST mechanism and its impact on LUNA | UST]] amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   The system prioritizes bids with the lowest premium first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   A premium of 0% is equivalent to buying bLuna at the market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   The platform allows users to obtain discounted bLuna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## OCRA Kujira's Business Model

OCRA generates revenue from two main sources:
1.  **UST from Smart Contract Execution**: Fees collected from the execution of smart contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
2.  **Withdrawal Fee**: A 1% fee charged when users withdraw their bLuna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

The platform also has its own tokens called "Gucci tokens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. These tokens can be used to pay transaction fees, offering a discount of 50% to 90% off the [[UST mechanism and its impact on LUNA | UST]] value of the fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Team and Future

The OCRA Kujira team reportedly has strong investors and partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. An Initial DEX Offering (IDO) for the project was scheduled for November 12th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. While the concept might not seem "exciting" in a bull market, it could present opportunities for favorable deals when the market experiences downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

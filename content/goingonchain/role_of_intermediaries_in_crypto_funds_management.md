Intermediaries in the crypto space, such as Finblox, aim to provide users with a streamlined way to manage and potentially earn interest on their crypto assets. However, a detailed analysis of their operations, particularly in light of financial challenges, reveals important considerations regarding their role and the transparency of their [[strategies_for_earning_interest_on_crypto_assets | earning strategies]].

## How Intermediaries Manage Funds

Platforms like Finblox, [[overview_of_ftx_app_features_for_crypto_management | FTX]], [[centralized_exchanges_and_fund_mishaps | Binance]], and Celsius all follow a similar process for managing user deposits:
*   **Unique Deposit Addresses** Each user is assigned a unique deposit address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This unique address allows the platform to recognize the incoming funds as belonging to a specific user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.
*   **Consolidation to Hot Wallets** From these unique user addresses, funds are typically sent almost immediately to a main hot wallet (deposit wallet) controlled by the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. This aggregation makes it easier for the platform to manage large volumes of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Withdrawal Process** Withdrawals are generally handled from a separate withdrawal wallet for easier and safer management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. However, for some assets like Bitcoin, the same wallet might be used for both deposits and withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>.

## Fund Allocation and Stated Strategies

Finblox, for example, claimed to separate user funds across "eight sophisticated different yielding strategies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>. However, an analysis of their on-chain transactions raised doubts about this claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>:
*   **Movement to Other Platforms** A significant portion of Finblox's user funds were transferred to major [[centralized_exchanges_and_fund_mishaps | exchanges]] like [[overview_of_ftx_app_features_for_crypto_management | FTX]] and [[centralized_exchanges_and_fund_mishaps | Binance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.
*   **Transfers to Competitors** Interestingly, Finblox also moved funds to competitor platforms such as BlockFi and Nexo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. This suggests that Finblox may primarily function as an intermediary, providing user funds to these other platforms, which themselves have distinct lending and borrowing products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>.
*   **Idle Funds** The analysis of Finblox's Bitcoin wallet showed that the funds remained largely "idle" or stagnant, with minimal inflow and outflow over time, indicating they were not actively being used for yield generation, despite advertised APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>.
*   **Exposure to 3AC** Finblox faced issues due to its exposure to 3AC (Three Arrows Capital), which resulted in withdrawal limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Funds, particularly USD Coin (USDC) and Singapore Dollars, were sent from Finblox's deposit wallet to a 3AC-affiliated wallet, with notable "random amounts" during a period of market instability (May 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>. This suggests that Finblox was lending user funds to 3AC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>. When rumors of 3AC's insolvency emerged, Finblox stopped lending to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>.

## Implications for Users

The operational model of intermediaries like Finblox highlights several important considerations for users:
*   **Risk of Intermediary Failure** By acting as a gateway to other platforms, intermediaries introduce an additional layer of risk. If users had directly deposited their funds with the underlying platforms (like Nexo or Vault), they might not have faced the same liquidity issues as those using Finblox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>.
*   **Transparency of Yield Strategies** The discrepancy between stated "sophisticated" strategies and the observed direct transfer of funds to other [[centralized_exchanges_and_fund_mishaps | exchanges]] or competitors raises questions about the transparency of how these intermediaries generate their yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>. Users could potentially earn interest directly through larger platforms without the additional intermediary risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:53">[00:34:53]</a>.
*   **On-Chain Analysis for Due Diligence** Users are encouraged to conduct their own [[strategies_for_secure_crypto_asset_management | on-chain analysis]] before depositing funds with lending protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>. Tools like Bitquery.io, DeBank, Zapper.fi, and Ape Board Finance can be used to track wallet flows, identify deposit/withdrawal wallets, and assess where funds are actually being moved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This can help determine if a platform genuinely employs unique [[strategies_for earning_interest_on_crypto_assets | yield-earning strategies]] or merely acts as a pass-through to other entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>.

In summary, while intermediaries offer convenience, it is crucial for users to understand that their funds might simply be moved to other platforms, introducing additional counterparty risk and potentially obscuring the true [[strategies_for_earning_interest_on_crypto_assets | yield generation methods]].

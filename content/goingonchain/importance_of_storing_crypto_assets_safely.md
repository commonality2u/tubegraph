The cryptocurrency space is dynamic and volatile, making the [[importance_of_cryptocurrency_security | security]] and self-custody of digital assets paramount. Recent events have underscored the critical need for users to hold their assets in non-custodial wallets rather than relying on centralized exchanges (CeX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Incidents Highlighting Security Risks

On October 21st, Crypto.com mistakenly sent 220,000 ETH to Gate.io <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Crypto.com's CEO stated it was a mistake and they worked with Gate.io to recover the funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. While Gate.io clarified that their proof of reserves on October 19th did not include this deposit, the incident fueled speculation and concerns among users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This event emphasized the need for users to withdraw their assets from CeX platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## "Not Your Key, Not Your Coin"

A fundamental principle in cryptocurrency is "not your key, not your coin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This mantra highlights that if you do not control the private keys to your crypto assets, you do not truly own them. Therefore, it is crucial to move assets out of centralized exchanges (CeX) and into wallets where you control the private keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Types of Wallets for Crypto Storage

Storing crypto tokens safely is a concern for many. Ideally, the best method for [[importance_of_digital_security_and_asset_management_in_cryptocurrency | digital security and asset management]] of cryptocurrency is through a cold wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Cold Wallets

Cold wallets are hardware devices that store your private keys offline, providing the highest level of [[security_measures_for_cryptocurrency_wallets | security measures for cryptocurrency wallets]].
*   **Ledger** is a commonly used brand for cold wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Hot Wallets

Hot wallets are software-based wallets connected to the internet. While less secure than cold wallets, they offer convenience for active use.
*   **MetaMask**: Works for Ethereum (ETH), Polygon (MATIC), Avalanche (AVAX), Fantom (FTM), and other EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) chains like Cronos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Blue Wallet**: Necessary for storing Bitcoin (BTC), as MetaMask does not support it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Phantom Wallet**: Used for Solana (SOL) assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Keplr IBC Wallet**: Recommended for Cosmos (ATOM) and other IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### Non-Custodial Wallets and Key Management

The wallets listed above (MetaMask, Blue Wallet, Phantom, Keplr IBC) are all [[noncustodial_wallets_and_key_management | non-custodial wallets and key management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This means you are solely responsible for managing your private keys or seed phrases. If you lose your keys, your assets are permanently gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. These wallets also offer more control, allowing users to add custom networks and configurations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Multi-Chain Wallets (e.g., Trust Wallet)

For simplicity, a multi-chain wallet like Trust Wallet can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Trust Wallet** supports various assets like ETH, BTC, SOL, and Cosmos, allowing them to be stored within a single application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   It is maintained and supported by Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   While it supports 65 blockchains and covers most common assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, it offers less configuration flexibility compared to other hot wallets, with no option to add custom networks or set RPCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Important Note**: Trust Wallet is *only* available as a mobile application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Any Trust Wallet extension found in the Chrome Web Store is a fake and a scam that should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

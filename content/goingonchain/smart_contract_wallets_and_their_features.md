A [[smart_contracts_in_freelance_agreements | smart contract]] wallet, also known as a smart wallet, is a type of cryptocurrency wallet that is actually a [[smart_contracts_in_freelance_agreements | smart contract]] deployed on a blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:15">[02:49:15]</a>. Unlike traditional wallets, these wallets allow for programmable functionalities and enhanced security features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:23">[03:07:23]</a>.

## Key Features

[[argent_wallet_features_and_user_experience | Argent]] is highlighted as an example of a [[smart_contracts_in_freelance_agreements | smart contract]] wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:15">[02:45:15]</a>. It is written on a [[smart_contracts_in_freelance_agreements | smart contract]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:57">[02:55:57]</a> and supports Ethereum and ZK Sync networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:37">[03:42:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:40">[03:57:40]</a>.

### Enhanced Security Measures

[[argent_smart_wallet_and_security_setup | Smart contract wallets]] offer advanced security options not found in typical wallets like [[comparison_between_hot_wallets_and_cold_wallets | Metamask]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:30">[03:16:30]</a>.

*   **Guardians (Multisig)**: Users can add third-party signers, known as "Guardians," who can act as a multi-signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:55">[04:53:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:27">[05:00:27]</a>. Guardians can approve transactions that exceed a user-defined limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:20">[05:09:20]</a>, help recover a lost wallet address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:34">[05:26:34]</a>, and even instantly lock a compromised wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:39">[05:31:39]</a>.
*   **Transfer Limits**: The ability to set maximum transfer limits for transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:47">[03:09:47]</a>.
*   **Approved Addresses**: Users can pre-approve specific addresses for sending funds, such as frequently used wallets or friends' addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:44">[03:12:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:04">[05:52:04]</a>.
*   **Token Allowance**: Control how much of a specific token can be spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:43">[06:01:43]</a>.
*   **Open-Source Contracts**: The source code for the wallet's underlying [[smart_contracts_in_freelance_agreements | smart contracts]] is open-source, allowing technical users to review them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:26">[03:30:26]</a>.
*   **Wallet Connect Compatibility**: Works with Wallet Connect for interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:04">[03:37:04]</a>.

### User Experience and Built-in Functionality

[[argent_wallet_features_and_user_experience | Argent]] is noted for its user-friendly interface, especially compared to the mobile app for [[comparison_between_hot_wallets_and_cold_wallets | Metamask]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:34">[04:07:34]</a>.

*   **Built-in Trading/DEX**: Allows users to swap tokens directly within the wallet interface, functioning like a decentralized exchange (DEX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:19">[06:40:19]</a>.
*   **Staking Options**: Provides direct access to staking services, such as ETH2 staking via Lido <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:47">[06:48:47]</a>.
*   **Index Funds**: Integrates with services like Index Coop for investing in crypto index funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:34">[07:16:34]</a>.
*   **Stablecoin Yields**: Offers opportunities to earn yield on stablecoins from protocols like Yearn, Aave, or Zerion Protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:44">[07:23:44]</a>. This feature brings decentralized finance (DeFi) opportunities directly to the user within the wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:06">[07:37:06]</a>.

## Limitations and Costs

While [[argent_smart_wallet_and_security_setup | smart contract wallets]] like [[argent_wallet_features_and_user_experience | Argent]] offer top-notch security, they come with certain costs and limitations due to their nature as [[smart_contracts_in_freelance_agreements | smart contracts]].

*   **[[network_fees_associated_with_smart_contract_wallets | Network fees]] for Activation**: Activating an [[argent_wallet_features_and_user_experience | Argent]] wallet requires paying a gas fee, which can be significant (e.g., ~$44 for 0.0145 ETH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:02">[02:59:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:04">[03:59:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:25">[04:37:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:19">[07:54:19]</a>.
*   **[[network_fees_associated_with_smart_contract_wallets | Network fees]] for Upgrades**: Upgrading wallet features, such as enabling support for ERC-1155 tokens, also incurs [[network_fees_associated_with_smart_contract_wallets | network fees]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:54">[08:00:54]</a>.
*   **[[network_fees_associated_with_smart_contract_wallets | Network fees]] for Wallet Recovery**: Recovering a lost wallet address through Guardians also requires paying a [[network_fees_associated_with_smart_contract_wallets | network fee]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.
*   **[[network_fees_associated_with_smart_contract_wallets | Network fees]] for Funding**: Funding an [[argent_wallet_features_and_user_experience | Argent]] wallet involves moving funds from L1 (Ethereum mainnet) to L2 (ZK Sync), which incurs [[network_fees_associated_with_smart_contract_wallets | network fees]] that vary with Ethereum gas prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:34">[08:47:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.
*   **Limited Chain Support**: [[argent_wallet_features_and_user_experience | Argent]] specifically supports only Ethereum and ZK Sync, making it unsuitable for users who frequently interact with other chains like Fantom, Avalanche, or Polygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:37">[03:42:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:10">[06:29:10]</a>.

## Context of Wallet Security

Recent incidents, such as a DeFiance Capital founder losing $1.6 million in a [[comparison_between_hot_wallets_and_cold_wallets | hot wallet]] hack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, highlight the importance of wallet security. Many hacks occur due to phishing attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a>, compromised laptops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:23">[00:43:23]</a>, or signing malicious transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>. Mobile phone [[using_cold_wallets_versus_hot_wallets | hot wallets]] are considered less safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.

While [[comparison_between_hot_wallets_and_cold_wallets | hot wallets]] like [[comparison_between_hot_wallets_and_cold_wallets | Metamask]] and [[difference_between_trust_wallet_mobile_and_desktop_versions | Trust Wallet]] are connected to the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:19">[01:26:19]</a>, [[comparison_between_hot_wallets_and_cold_wallets | cold wallets]] are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:04">[01:32:04]</a>. Pairing a [[comparison_between_hot_wallets_and_cold_wallets | hot wallet]] like [[comparison_between_hot_wallets_and_cold_wallets | Metamask]] with a hardware device (like Ledger) can make it function more like a [[comparison_between_hot_wallets_and_cold_wallets | cold wallet]], requiring physical signing for transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:25">[01:37:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:34">[09:16:34]</a>. However, even with a hardware device, signing a malicious [[smart_contracts_in_freelance_agreements | contract]] remains the user's mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:19">[01:51:19]</a>.

Some users also employ multiple wallet addresses for different purposes (e.g., trading, DeFi, NFTs, testing) to manage risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:48">[02:10:48]</a>.

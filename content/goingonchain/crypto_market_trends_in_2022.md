The year 2022 was characterized by a significant downturn in the [[crypto_market_sentiment | crypto market]], with personal portfolios experiencing declines of approximately 80% to 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This period was marked by a series of events that impacted the broader market and investor confidence.

## Key Market Events

### January-February: Wonderland Rug Pull
The year began with the Wonderland rug pull, which significantly affected some investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, particularly those drawn into the "frog nation" narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### March: Federal Interest Rate Hikes
In March, the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates, increasing them from 0.25% to 4.375% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This action led to a cessation of "money printing," the withdrawal of risk capital, and the onset of a liquidity crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### May: Fall of Luna
May saw a major market event with the collapse of Luna (Terra) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This event triggered a "House of Cards" chain reaction throughout the crypto ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### June: Celsius and Three Arrows Capital
By June, Celsius halted withdrawals, followed by the liquidation of Three Arrows Capital (3AC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. During this period, Ethereum (ETH) dropped below $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### September: The Merge
September brought significant news with the successful completion of the Ethereum Merge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Late 2022: FTX Collapse
A major event towards the end of the year was the FTX Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing and associated fraud by Sam Bankman-Fried (SPF), who was later released on bail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Overall Environment

Beyond these specific incidents, 2022 was characterized by a pervasive presence of scams and fraud within the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Despite these challenges, the continued presence of individuals in the market demonstrated a strong belief in the future of crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

From: [[goingonchain]] <br/> 

Mofo is a lending and borrowing market with distinct "Earn" and "Borrow" sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Within the "Earn" feature, users can provide liquidity to "votes" and earn yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. These "votes" are created and managed by individuals known as curators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Functions of Curators

Curators play a key role in the "Earn" ecosystem by serving as [[role_of_intermediaries_in_crypto_funds_management | active managers]] of user funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Their responsibilities include:

*   **Creating Votes** Curators are responsible for establishing the "votes" where users deposit liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Fund Management** Curators actively manage the deposited assets within their respective "votes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This includes allocating capital to different markets to generate yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. For example, in a Seamless USDC vote, 77% of the deposited USDC might be allocated to the CBBTC USDC market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. The liquidity from these votes is then channeled into various [[advantages_of_isolated_lending_markets_in_mofo | isolated markets]] created within Mofo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Fee Collection** Curators charge a performance fee for their management services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. For instance, the Seamless USDC vote by Gunlett had a 15% performance fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

This modular and [[permissionless_and_customizable_markets_in_mofo | permissionless]] structure, allowing anyone to create markets and for curators to manage funds, contributes to Mofo's traction and its appeal for [[adoption_of_mofo_technology_by_other_platforms | adoption by other platforms]] like Compound and Verachain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

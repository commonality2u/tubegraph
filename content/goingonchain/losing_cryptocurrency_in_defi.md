Losing cryptocurrency in decentralized finance (DeFi) can be a painful experience, as illustrated by a personal account involving a hack on Grim Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. In this incident, a user lost their entire position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Specific Incident: Grim Finance Hack

A significant loss occurred when Grim Finance was hacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The user had placed their position on a Saturday night, and the hack took place the following Sunday morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This resulted in the user losing all their holdings within that protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Key Lesson: Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins

One of the most important lessons learned from such events is the principle of "not your keys, not your coins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This highlights the importance of retaining control over one's private keys to maintain true ownership of cryptocurrency.

## Mitigation: [[defi_insurance_options | DeFi Insurance Options]]

For individuals engaging in [[investing_in_cryptocurrency | investing in cryptocurrency]] within DeFi and holding large positions, acquiring [[defi_insurance_options | DeFi insurance options]] is a recommended strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Availability and Limitations

*   **Insure:** Platforms like Insure can be checked for coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. While it does not cover Grim Finance, it does cover other protocols within the Fantom ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Claim Process:** If a covered protocol, such as Abracadabra, gets hacked, users with insurance can claim back their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Anchor Protocol:** Insurance for protocols like Anchor Protocol is also available, but it tends to run out very quickly, requiring users to check frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

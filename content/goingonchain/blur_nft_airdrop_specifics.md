Blur is a new NFT marketplace and aggregator that also provides features like real-time pricing for NFT traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Unlike speculation surrounding other potential token drops like [[arbitrum_airdrop_speculation | Arbitrum]] or [[optimism_and_arbitrum_airdrops | Optimism]], Blur has a confirmed airdrop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Information about the airdrop is available on blur.io/airdrop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Airdrop Campaigns

Blur has two distinct airdrop campaigns: Airdrop 1 and Airdrop 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### Airdrop 1

Airdrop 1 targets users who have traded NFTs in the six months prior to the announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Qualification and the amount received are dependent on the user's trading volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Recipients receive "care packages," which will later convert into Blur tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Different types of care packages exist, with "legendary" packages containing significantly more Blur tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

Users had 14 days to claim Airdrop 1, starting from October 19th, suggesting the collection period concluded around the first week of November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### Airdrop 2

Airdrop 2 is designed for users who missed Airdrop 1 or wish to participate further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. To qualify, users must list at least one NFT on the Blur platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

The listing setup on Blur offers several [[blur_nft_marketplace_features | features]] and [[benefits_of_listing_nfts_on_blur | benefits]]:
*   **Cross-Marketplace Listing** Users can list an NFT on Blur or concurrently push it to other marketplaces like LooksRare and OpenSea (X2Y2 was temporarily disabled) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Flexible Pricing** Prices can be set at the floor price, top trade, or via a ladder system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Auto-Fee Adjustment** An option to auto-adjust for all fees is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **No Marketplace Fee** Blur does not charge a marketplace fee, and royalties are optional for users to contribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

#### Strategies to Maximize Airdrop 2

While there is no explicit formula for Airdrop 2, the following [[strategies_to_maximize_blur_token_airdrops | strategies]] are recommended to maximize the airdrop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>:
*   **List More NFTs** Listing a higher quantity of NFTs is encouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **List Blue-Chip and Active Collections** Listing blue-chip NFTs and those from active collections is beneficial because active collections generate more volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Incentivized Royalties** Users who choose to give royalties, even though optional, will be rewarded with Blur tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This incentivizes users to list more NFTs, attracting more platform usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Loyalty Points** Every wallet accrues loyalty points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. If a user lists their NFT on multiple marketplaces but lists it at the lowest price on Blur, they will earn high loyalty points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Higher loyalty points increase the odds of receiving "super rare" care packages, which contain a greater number of Blur tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Token Release

The Blur tokens themselves are expected to be released in January 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Currently, the focus is on collecting the care packages through the airdrop campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

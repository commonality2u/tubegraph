Tangible is a marketplace that facilitates [[converting_real_world_assets_into_nfts | converting real world assets into NFTs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Through Tangible, users can purchase physical items such as gold bars and watches using USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## How it Works

When a purchase is made on Tangible, an NFT (referred to as a tNFT) is minted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The corresponding real-world asset is stored in a vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

### Storage and Delivery

*   **Storage Fees**: Because the physical item is kept in a vault, a storage fee applies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. These fees are typically associated with [[storing_and_managing_highvalue_nfts_with_tangible | high-value items]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Delivery Option**: Users have the option to take delivery of their purchased item at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### Platform Fees

A platform fee of 2.5% is charged when an item is acquired from another seller on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This fee is distributed as follows:
*   33% is used to buy and burn Tangible tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   66.66% goes to Tangible stakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

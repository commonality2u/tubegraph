The [[argent_smart_wallet_features | Argent wallet]] is categorized as a "smart wallet" because it is a smart contract wallet, meaning its functionality is written on a smart contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:57">[02:51:57]</a>. This underlying structure enables advanced [[security_features_of_crypto_wallets | security features]] not typically found in traditional hot wallets like Metamask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:07">[03:19:07]</a>. The developers note that Argent's security is "top notch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:10">[07:47:10]</a>.

## Key Security Features

Argent's smart contract design allows for programmable [[features_of_argent_smart_wallet | features]] that enhance asset protection:
*   **Multisig Capabilities** Argent enables users to set up multi-signature (multisig) requirements for transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:07">[03:09:07]</a>.
*   **Guardians** A core security feature is the "guardian" system, which functions similarly to multisig <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:23">[04:53:23]</a>. Guardians are third-party signers who can:
    *   Approve transactions, especially those exceeding a user-defined limit (e.g., $5,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:42">[05:09:42]</a>.
    *   Aid in wallet recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:42">[05:26:42]</a>.
    *   Instantly lock a compromised wallet, for example, if a mobile phone is lost or compromised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:42">[05:34:42]</a>.
    *   Approve transactions to untrusted addresses and dApps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:23">[05:50:23]</a>.
*   **Transfer Limits** Users can set daily or per-transaction transfer limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:07">[03:12:07]</a>.
*   **Approved Addresses** The wallet allows users to pre-approve specific addresses for sending funds, making transactions to common contacts (e.g., friends' wallets) more secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:07">[03:14:07]</a>.
*   **Token Allowance** Users can set allowances for how much of a specific token can be spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:07">[06:01:07]</a>.
*   **Open Source Contracts** Argent's smart contracts are open source, allowing technical users to review the code for vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:17">[03:30:17]</a>.

## Costs Associated with Argent's Smart Contract Nature

While providing robust [[security_of_crypto_assets | security]], the smart contract nature of Argent does incur certain [[cost_associated_with_using_argent_wallet | costs]]:
*   **Activation Fees** When activating the wallet for the first time, users must pay a gas fee, which can be around $44 (e.g., 0.0145 ETH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:42">[02:59:42]</a>.
*   **Upgrade Fees** Upgrading the wallet's features (e.g., to support ERC-1155 tokens) also requires paying network fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:05">[06:06:05]</a>.
*   **Wallet Recovery Fees** If a wallet needs to be recovered, a network fee is charged because this process involves interacting with the smart contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:15">[08:11:15]</a>. Previously, Argent covered these costs, but now users are responsible for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:05">[08:18:05]</a>.
*   **Funding Fees** Funding the Argent wallet incurs a network fee, as it involves moving funds from Layer 1 (Ethereum mainnet) to Layer 2 (ZKsync) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:01">[08:26:01]</a>. The gas cost for such a transfer can be around $9.45, varying with Ethereum gas prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:49">[08:57:49]</a>.

## Comparisons to Other Wallets

Traditional hot wallets like Metamask and [[trust_wallet_app_risks | Trust Wallet app]] are connected to the internet, making them less safe than cold wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:49">[01:21:49]</a>. While hot wallets are convenient, they are more susceptible to [[hacking_incidents_in_cryptocurrency_wallets | hacking incidents]] like phishing attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:78">[00:37:78]</a>. The speaker highlights a founder who lost $1.6 million due to a hot wallet hack likely caused by phishing on a mobile phone, emphasizing that mobile hot wallets are "not safe enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Other incidents include MetaMask Chrome extension hacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:57">[00:54:57]</a> and NFT thefts via phishing attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

For enhanced [[security_of_crypto_assets | security]], connecting a Metamask wallet to a hardware device like Ledger (a cold wallet) allows transactions to be signed offline, making it more secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:07">[01:37:07]</a>. However, a hardware wallet cannot prevent mistakes like signing a malicious contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. Additionally, managing multiple wallet addresses for different purposes (e.g., trading, DeFi, NFT, storage, testing) can also improve security by compartmentalizing assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. For ultimate [[security_measures_for_nft_buyers | security]], seed phrases can be written on paper and stored offline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:43">[09:29:43]</a>.

## What are Crypto Bribes?

A bribe is traditionally an incentive, often given "under the table," for someone to act in a certain way, as long as they don't get caught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, [[Crypto Bribes in Decentralized Exchanges | crypto bribes]] operate differently; they are open and transparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. In this context, a protocol openly tells a token holder to vote for them, and in return, the holder receives a share of the bribe, which can be substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. For instance, an offering of 100K in F-beats has been observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## How Crypto Bribes Change the Game for DEX Tokens

Initially, the relationship in Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) involved [[Stakeholders in decentralized exchanges | liquidity pool providers]] (LPs) and stakers farming for DEX tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Protocols seek high liquidity, which LPs provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Previously, LPs were often ready to "dump" their DEX tokens at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

The introduction of crypto bribes fundamentally alters this dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. DEXs now openly announce that a percentage of their token emission (e.g., 30%) will be distributed based on votes, with the protocol receiving the highest votes getting the largest portion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Impact on Protocols

With the new system, protocols actively compete for votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. By securing more votes, they can:
*   **Increase DEX Token Rewards**: They increase the DEX token rewards for their pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Attract More Liquidity Providers**: Higher rewards draw more LPs to their pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Boost Protocol Token Purchases**: Participants might buy the protocol's own tokens to chase high Annual Percentage Rates (APRs), as seen with the "Sharp" protocol, which can also push up the price of the protocol's token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

Protocols also have the option to buy DEX tokens themselves, which adds buying pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. However, this isn't sustainable long-term as it would excessively drive up the DEX token price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This is where [[Crypto Bribes in Decentralized Exchanges | crypto bribes]] become crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Impact on DEX Token Value

[[Crypto Bribes in Decentralized Exchanges | Crypto bribes]] significantly influence DEX token value by aligning incentives among various [[Stakeholders in decentralized exchanges | stakeholders]]:

*   **Increased Demand from Protocols**: Projects offer direct incentives (e.g., 100K VIS) to DEX token holders to vote for their protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This attracts DEX token holders even if they are not part of the protocol's specific liquidity pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Liquidity Providers Retain Tokens**: LPs are less willing to sell their DEX tokens because they need them to vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. They typically vote for their own pools to help them win and earn more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Stakers Earn More Yield**: Stakers, who already hold DEX tokens, have no reason to sell them; instead, they use them to vote and earn additional yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Lower Slippage and Increased Trading**: The increased liquidity from LPs holding their tokens leads to lower slippage, which attracts traders and generates more trading fees for the DEX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Consistent Buying Pressure**: The desire for holders to get more of the "bribe" adds continuous buying pressure to the DEX token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

Essentially, [[Stakeholders in decentralized exchanges | stakeholders]] like stakers and LPs have no incentive to sell their DEX tokens because they can use them for [[Voting Dynamics in DeFi Protocols | voting]] and earn rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Traders benefit from low slippage and high liquidity, while protocols benefit from high liquidity and participants buying their tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Case Studies

*   **Bits**: Before January of a given year, Bits tokens tended to be "dumped" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. However, starting January 6th, they began offering bribes (30% of their emission), which generated traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. People started wanting more Bits tokens, leading to continuous buying pressure and holders experiencing the benefits of the bribe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. While selling pressure isn't entirely eliminated, the buying pressure from bribes becomes strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **SpiritSwap**: SpiritSwap is another DEX utilizing [[Crypto Bribes in Decentralized Exchanges | crypto bribes]], with examples like Greater DAO conducting bribes through SpiritSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Investment Considerations

When [[Challenges of investing in DEX tokens | investing in DEX tokens]], it's crucial to look for this type of incentive setup where all [[Stakeholders in decentralized exchanges | stakeholders]] are aligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This alignment provides a reason to hold the DEX token and participate in [[Crypto Bribes in Decentralized Exchanges | crypto bribes]], adding buying pressure to the underlying tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Without such a setup, the DEX token might simply remain a "farming token" susceptible to selling pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

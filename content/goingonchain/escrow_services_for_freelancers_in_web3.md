Freelancers and independent contractors often face the challenge of non-payment from clients, where differing interpretations of project standards can lead to disputes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Traditional Web2 platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, or Dynamic Design offer solutions, but the Web3 space requires a blockchain-based approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This is where Trust Treaty comes in, offering an escrow service built on a blockchain to address the [[challenges_faced_by_web3_freelancers | challenges faced by Web3 freelancers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Trust Treaty: A Refundable Smart Contract

Trust Treaty is a Web3 escrow service designed as a refundable smart contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. It aims to provide a secure and fair environment for transactions between clients and service providers in the decentralized space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### How Trust Treaty Works

The process on Trust Treaty involves several steps for both clients and service providers:

#### Client Contract Creation
1.  **Initiating a New Contract**: A client, such as an NFT client, can create a new contract on the Trust Treaty platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
2.  **Contract Details**: Key information is entered, including:
    *   Contract title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
    *   Clear expectations and requirements from both parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
    *   Start and end dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
    *   The agreed-upon price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
3.  **Payment and Fees**:
    *   The price can be locked in using stablecoins such as USD, USDT, and USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
    *   A platform fee is applied to the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
    *   A maximum dispute cost of 50% is set, which can decrease if the transaction value decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
4.  **Securing Funds**: When the client commits payment, the funds are moved to a new wallet address secured by the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The client does not have direct access to this wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
5.  **Anonymity**: Users on Trust Treaty are represented by their wallet addresses, allowing unknown designers or service providers to remain anonymous while participating in projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
6.  **Formalizing the Contract**: Once all details are filled, the client signs the contract, generating a unique link that can be shared with the service provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

#### Service Provider Interaction
1.  **Reviewing the Contract**: The service provider receives the link and can review the contract title, details, and settlement value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
2.  **Signing and Activation**: If everything is in order, the service provider signs the contract, making it effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
3.  **Communication**: Both parties can use the platform's UI to communicate throughout the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
4.  **Requesting Payment**: Upon completion of the work, the service provider can request payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

#### Payment and Dispute Resolution
1.  **Fund Release**: If the client is satisfied, they can finalize the agreement, which releases the funds to the service provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
2.  **Dispute Process**: If issues arise, the client can open a dispute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
    *   Both the client and service provider submit their evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
    *   Two independent dispute agents are assigned to analyze the situation and provide their assessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
    *   If both agents agree, their decision is final, and funds are either sent to the provider or refunded to the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
    *   If agents disagree, a manager intervenes to make the final decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### Use Cases and Risks

Trust Treaty is particularly useful for the growing volume of remote work in the Web3 space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. However, like any platform, it carries certain risks:

*   **Platform Risk**: If the Trust Treaty platform ceases to exist, the funds held in its secured wallet may also be lost, as neither the client nor the service provider holds the keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Dispute Decision Bias**: Although dispute agents make independent decisions, there is still a potential for human bias in their assessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

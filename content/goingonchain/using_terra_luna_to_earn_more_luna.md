[[significant_cryptocurrency_failures_in_2022_such_as_luna_and_ftx | LUNA]] has experienced significant growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. If you hold [[significant_cryptocurrency_failures_in_2022_such_as_luna_and_ftx | LUNA]], you can leverage it to earn additional [[significant_cryptocurrency_failures_in_2022_sLUNA|LUNA]] and qualify for airdrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This is primarily achieved through staking.

## Staking LUNA

To earn more [[significant_cryptocurrency_failures_in_2022_such_as_luna_and_ftx | LUNA]], you need to [[staking_luna_via_terra_wallet | stake]] it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

1.  **Access your Wallet**
    Go to your [[staking_luna_via_terra_wallet | Terra wallet]] and click on the "Staking" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

2.  **Choose a Validator**
    You will find a list of 105 validators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. They are typically sorted by uptime by default, but you can change the sorting to commission or voting power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. When selecting a validator, consider the following:
    *   **Voting Power** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>: It is generally not recommended to stake with the top 5 validators to avoid concentrating power at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
    *   **Self-Delegation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>: This indicates the amount a validator has delegated to themselves, demonstrating their "skin in the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. A higher self-delegation percentage is often preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
    *   **Commission** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>: This is the percentage the validator takes from your rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. You may want to look for validators with zero percent commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
    *   **Uptime** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>: Aim for validators with 100% uptime, as you will not earn rewards if they are not operational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

3.  **Delegate Your LUNA**
    Once you have chosen your validator, click "Delegate," enter the amount of [[significant_cryptocurrency_failures_in_2022_such_as_luna_and_ftx | LUNA]] you wish to stake, click "Next," and confirm the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

After successful delegation, you will be able to view a summary of your delegated amount and the rewards you are earning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

Blur is a new NFT marketplace and aggregator that provides features and real-time pricing for NFT traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. They have a confirmed airdrop, which is not speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Users can visit blur.io/airdrop to access the airdrop page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Airdrop 1

Airdrop 1 is for users who have traded NFTs in the last six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The amount received depends on trading volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Recipients receive "care packages" that will later be translated into Blur tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. There are different types of care packages, with legendary packages containing significantly more Blur tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

Users had 14 days to claim Airdrop 1 from the article's publication date of October 19, suggesting the collection period would end around the first week of November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Airdrop 2

For those who missed Airdrop 1, Airdrop 2 is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. To qualify for Airdrop 2, users must list at least one NFT on the Blur platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Listing Features

Blur's listing setup is designed to be user-friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>:
*   NFTs can be listed on Blur or concurrently pushed to LooksRare and OpenSea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   Users can easily set prices at the floor price, top trade, or using a ladder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   An auto-adjust feature is available for fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   Blur does not have a marketplace fee, and applying a royalty fee is optional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Incentivized Royalties

Blur offers "incentivized royalties," meaning if users choose to give royalties, they will be rewarded with Blur tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This strategy encourages users to list more NFTs, attracting more users to the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Maximizing Airdrop 2

While there is no explicit formula for Airdrop 2, the platform has shared [[strategies_to_maximize_blur_token_airdrop | strategies to maximize the airdrop]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>:
*   List more NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   List "blue chip" NFTs and those from active collections, as active collections generate volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   Opt-in to give royalties; while not mandatory, doing so will reward users with airdrop tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Loyalty:** Each wallet has a loyalty point system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. If NFTs are listed on different marketplaces but are priced lowest on Blur, the wallet will accumulate high loyalty points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Higher loyalty points increase the odds of receiving super rare care packages, which contain a significantly larger amount of Blur tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Token Release

The Blur tokens themselves are scheduled to be released in January 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Currently, the focus is on collecting the care packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

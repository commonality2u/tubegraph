The [[Interest rates on Anchor Protocol | Anchor Protocol]] has implemented a dynamic saving rate, adjusting its interest offerings based on a specific formula rather than a fixed 19.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This change is crucial for the [[sustainability_of_anchor_platform | sustainability of the Anchor platform]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Yield Reserve and Interest Rate Adjustments

The dynamic saving rate mechanism is directly tied to the yield reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. If the yield reserve increases by 1.5%, the earn rate will also go up by 1.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Conversely, if the yield reserve decreases by 1.5%, the earn rate will go down by the same percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. These adjustments occur monthly, with a maximum monthly change of plus or minus 1.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

The lowest possible earn rate is 15%, while the maximum is 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Given a downward trend in the yield reserve, it is anticipated that [[anchor_earn_interest_rate_changes | Anchor's interest]] will begin to drop in May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This trend indicates that more users are depositing funds than borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Market Sentiment and Borrowing

To narrow the gap between deposits and borrowing, Anchor needs to encourage more borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. One strategy is to add more collateral options to attract users from other ecosystems to borrow UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. For example, users can now borrow UST using staked AVAX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

However, the effectiveness of adding new collateral types is heavily influenced by overall market sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. In a bear market, individuals are generally less willing to take risks and, consequently, less willing to borrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This means that even with the introduction of additional collateral options, borrowing activity might not significantly increase if market sentiment remains negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

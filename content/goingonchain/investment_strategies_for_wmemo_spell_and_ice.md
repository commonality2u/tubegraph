During a period of bearish market sentiment where a portfolio might be down significantly (e.g., 30%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, specific strategies are employed for various crypto assets.

## General Investment Approach

A key strategy is to continue [[cryptocurrency_investment_strategies | dollar-cost averaging (DCA)]] into strong projects. The bear market is considered the best time to accumulate, provided one can endure the associated pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Using the [[cryptocurrency_investment_strategies | DCA strategy]] helps avoid "catching the falling knife" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This approach is underpinned by the observation that [[cryptocurrency_investment_strategies | crypto adoption]] continues to grow and the underlying technology remains unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Specific Asset Strategies

### wMEMO

For Frog Nation assets, specifically [[explanation_of_wmemo_in_wonderland | wMEMO]], a short-term, scalping strategy around AMAs (Ask Me Anything sessions) has been adopted. This involves selling [[explanation_of_wmemo_in_wonderland | wMEMO]] before an AMA and buying back after, or vice-versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This is explicitly stated as not a long-term holding strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### SPELL and ICE

Despite concerns about their [[investment_strategies_and_tokenomics_of_radiant_capital | tokenomics]], SPELL and ICE tokens are being held. The belief is that they are "good products" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Important Considerations

It is crucial to only invest money that one can afford to lose, as the crypto market is highly volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

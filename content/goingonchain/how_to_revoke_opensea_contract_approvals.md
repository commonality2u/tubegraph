Recent events highlight the importance of understanding and managing your contract approvals on platforms like Opensea.

## Why Revoke Approvals?

A [[opensea_phishing_attack_on_nft_users | phishing attack on Opensea]] has been observed, leading 17 users to accidentally fall victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The funds from the hacker's wallet have reportedly been sent to Tornado Cash, a service that makes crypto untraceable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

This situation arose following an [[opensea_smart_contract_migration_issue | Opensea smart contract migration issue]] where Opensea released a new smart contract and requested users to [[canceling_listings_and_offers_on_opensea | migrate the listing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This new contract was intended to upgrade and delete inactive NFTs on Ethereum, as previous hacks had occurred due to inactive NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Opensea shared the link for this new contract on its Twitter channel and via email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. It is believed that the hacker exploited this opportunity to target users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Some users have also indicated that the Opensea contract itself might contain a flaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

To enhance your security, it is advisable to revoke your existing approval to Opensea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

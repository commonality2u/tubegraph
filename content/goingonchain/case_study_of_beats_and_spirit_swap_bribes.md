## Understanding Crypto Bribes

[[Crypto Bribes in Decentralized Exchanges | Crypto bribes]] are a form of incentive, distinct from traditional "under the table" bribes because they are open and transparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. In the context of decentralized exchanges (DEXs), a protocol might openly tell a token holder to vote for them, offering a share of a bribe, which could be significant (e.g., 100k of FBEATS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

Traditionally, liquidity providers (LPs) and stakers would farm for DEX tokens, with LPs ready to dump the tokens at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Protocols seek high liquidity, and LPs can provide this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

The game changed when DEXs began to offer a portion of their token emissions (e.g., 30%) based on votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The protocol with the highest votes receives the largest portion of these emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### The Dynamics of Crypto Bribes

*   **Protocols Fight for Votes**: Protocols actively campaign for votes to increase their DEX token rewards for their pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This, in turn, attracts more liquidity providers to their pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Participant Engagement**: Participants might buy protocol tokens to chase high APRs (Annual Percentage Rates), which also helps push up the price of the protocol token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **LP Retention**: LPs become less willing to sell their DEX tokens because they need them to vote, often for their own pools to secure wins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Protocol Strategy**: Protocols can buy DEX tokens, adding buying pressure to the DEX token itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. However, continuous buying can push the DEX token price too high, making it unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Bribes for Holders**: This is where [[Crypto Bribes in Decentralized Exchanges | crypto bribes]] become crucial: projects offer significant incentives (e.g., 100k USD worth of tokens) to DEX token holders to vote for their protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This attracts even those DEX token holders who are not part of the protocol's specific liquidity pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Staker Involvement**: Stakers, who already hold DEX tokens, also participate by using their tokens to vote and earn more yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Benefits for Traders**: Increased liquidity from LPs leads to low slippage, allowing traders to trade more efficiently on the DEX, generating more trading fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### Aligned Incentives

With [[Crypto Bribes in Decentralized Exchanges | crypto bribes]], incentives align across all stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>:
*   **Stakers/LPs**: Have no reason to sell their DEX tokens as they can vote and earn bribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Traders**: Are drawn to the DEX due to low slippage and high liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   **Protocols**: Benefit from high liquidity and participants buying their tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **DEX Tokens**: Experience increased buying pressure as holders seek more of the bribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## Case Study: Beats

Before January, the Beats token often faced selling pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. However, starting January 6, Beats began offering [[Crypto Bribes in Decentralized Exchanges | bribes]] by dedicating 30% of their emission for voting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This initiative gained traction as people started voting, leading to increased demand for Beats tokens and sustained buying pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. While selling pressure didn't disappear entirely, the bribes generated strong buying pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Case Study: Spirit Swap

[[Partnership with Spirit Swap | Spirit Swap]] is another decentralized exchange that utilizes [[Crypto Bribes in Decentralized Exchanges | crypto bribes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. An example includes "Greater Dal" (likely Grail Dao or similar) conducting bribes with [[Partnership with Spirit Swap | Spirit Swap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This online incentive structure encourages users to hold DEX tokens and participate in sharing the crypto bribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. It also adds buying pressure to the "Greater Dal" token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

When considering investments in DEX tokens, it is advisable to look for incentive setups where all stakeholders are aligned, similar to the model seen with [[Crypto Bribes in Decentralized Exchanges | crypto bribes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Otherwise, the DEX token might primarily function as a mere farming token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

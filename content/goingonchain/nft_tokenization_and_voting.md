The Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT collection experienced a unique situation with the distribution of its accompanying APE coin tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The APE coin price was approximately $13 per token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Owning a single BAYC NFT entitled the holder to receive about 10,000 APE coin tokens, valued at approximately $130,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Airdrop Mechanism and "No Snapshot" Rule

A key aspect of the APE coin airdrop was the absence of a snapshot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This meant that as long as an individual owned a BAYC NFT, they could withdraw the associated APE coin tokens once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This mechanism led to an increase in the BAYC floor price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## NFT Tokenization for Flash Loan Exploitation

An individual, referred to as an "anon," leveraged a technique called a flash loan to capitalize on this airdrop rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### NFTX and Tokenized NFTs

The anon identified an NFTX vault containing five BAYC NFTs that had not yet claimed their APE coin tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. NFTX allows for the tokenization of NFTs, similar to how Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) represent ownership of underlying real estate assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. When a user buys a tokenized BAYC, they own a portion of the underlying BAYC NFTs within the vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### The Flash Loan Execution

The anon executed the following steps:
1.  **Initial Purchase**: Purchased a BAYC NFT from OpenSea for approximately $300,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
2.  **Flash Loan Initiation**: Used this purchased BAYC as collateral on the NFTX vault to take out a flash loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. A flash loan enables borrowing a large amount with low cost, provided the loan is repaid within the same blockchain block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
3.  **Borrow and Claim**: In a single transaction, the anon borrowed the five BAYC NFTs from the NFTX vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Using these borrowed NFTs, they claimed approximately 60,000 APE coin tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
4.  **Repay and Sell**: The borrowed BAYC NFTs were then returned to the NFTX vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The anon also sold the initial BAYC NFT they had bought back into the vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
5.  **Profit**: The claimed APE coins were sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, resulting in the anon walking away with an estimated $800,000 profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Attack or Arbitrage?

This incident raises questions about whether such an action constitutes an attack or an arbitrage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

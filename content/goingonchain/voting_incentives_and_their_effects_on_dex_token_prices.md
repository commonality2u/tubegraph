## What are Crypto Bribes?
Crypto bribes are a form of incentive, distinct from traditional, often "under the table" bribes because they are open and transparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. In the context of decentralized exchanges (DEXs), a protocol openly offers a share of a "bribe" (e.g., 100k FBEATS) to DEX token holders who vote for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. These [[impact_of_crypto_bribes_on_decentralized_exchange_dex_tokens | crypto bribes]] are changing the game for DEXs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## The Game-Changing Role of Crypto Bribes for DEXs
Previously, [[role_of_liquidity_providers_and_stakers_in_dex_token_systems | liquidity providers]] (LPs) and stakers would "farm" DEX tokens and might readily sell them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. With [[impact_of_crypto_bribes_on_decentralized_exchange_dex_tokens | crypto bribes]], DEXs now allocate a portion of their token emissions (e.g., 30% of BEATS emission) based on votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The protocol that garners the most votes receives the largest share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### How Protocols Engage in Voting
Protocols actively compete for votes to increase the DEX token rewards for their specific pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This competition attracts more [[liquidity_providers_and_incentives | liquidity providers]] to their pools and encourages participants to buy the protocol's own tokens to chase higher APRs (Annual Percentage Rates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. For example, high APRs can help push up the price of a protocol's token, like "SHARP" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Impact on DEX Token Holders
[[role_of_liquidity_providers_and_stakers_in_dex_token_systems | Liquidity providers]] are now less inclined to sell their DEX tokens because these tokens are essential for voting, often for their own pools, to ensure they win rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Protocols can also buy DEX tokens to gain voting power, which adds buying pressure to the DEX token itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

However, a more sustainable method is the [[impact_of_crypto_bribes_on_decentralized_exchange_dex_tokens | crypto bribe]] model. Protocols offer direct payments (like up to 100k USD) to DEX token holders who vote for their protocol, even if those holders are not part of their specific liquidity pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Stakers also benefit, as they can use their existing DEX tokens to vote and earn additional yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Aligned Incentives and Market Effects
The introduction of voting incentives creates an aligned ecosystem where all stakeholders benefit:
*   **[[role_of_liquidity_providers_and_stakers_in_dex_token_systems | LPs]] and Stakers:** They hold onto their DEX tokens because they can use them to vote and earn more yield from bribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This mitigates the [[challenges_with_holding_dex_tokens | challenge of DEX tokens being easily dumped]].
*   **[[role_of_traders_and_protocols_in_dex | Traders]]:** Increased liquidity from LPs means lower slippage, making it more attractive for traders to use the DEX and generating more trading fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **[[role_of_traders_and_protocols_in_dex | Protocols]]:** They benefit from higher liquidity for their pools and increased purchases of their own tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

This system collectively adds significant buying pressure to the DEX token, as holders are incentivized to acquire more to maximize their share of the bribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## Case Study: BEATS
The BEATS token historically faced selling pressure. However, starting January 6th, they began offering [[impact_of_crypto_bribes_on_decentralized_exchange_dex_tokens | crypto bribes]] with 30% of their emission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This initiative led to increased voting activity, a surge in demand for BEATS tokens, and consistent buying pressure, despite ongoing selling pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Other Examples
Besides BEATS, SpiritSwap is another DEX that has implemented [[impact_of_crypto_bribes_on_decentralized_exchange_dex_tokens | crypto bribes]], with projects like Greater DAO offering incentives through them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## Investment Considerations
When investing in a DEX token, it's crucial to look for an incentive structure where all stakeholders are aligned, particularly through voting mechanisms and crypto bribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This alignment provides a strong [[utility_of_dex_tokens | utility of DEX tokens]] beyond mere farming, adding sustained buying pressure to the token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Without such a setup, a DEX token risks remaining primarily a farming token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

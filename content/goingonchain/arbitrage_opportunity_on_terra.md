An [[arbitrage_opportunities_in_cryptocurrency | arbitrage opportunity]] exists on Terra, specifically within the Nexus Protocol's liquid pylon pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Overview of the Liquid Pylon Pool

The Nexus Protocol's liquid pylon pool is a 24-month investment where users deposit UST, which becomes locked for the duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. As a reward for participation, users receive Nexus tokens, with the current annual percentage rate (APR) around 15.73% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

A key distinction of this liquid pylon pool compared to a regular pylon pool is the issuance of a receipt token called bPsiDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This bPsiDP token can be traded on Terraswap for UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## The De-Peg Opportunity

Currently, there is a de-peg where the bPsiDP token trades at a discount to the UST deposited into the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This means a user might spend $100 to acquire bPsiDP tokens that represent $128 worth of deposited UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The de-peg is significant, fluctuating around 28% to 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## How to Leverage the Opportunity

To take advantage of this situation, one must be bullish on the Nexus token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. There are two primary strategies:

1.  **Wait for De-peg Correction**: If you acquire bPsiDP at a discount (e.g., $100 for $128 worth), you can wait for the de-peg to correct, allowing you to sell the bPsiDP for a value closer to its underlying UST equivalent on Terraswap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
2.  **Worst-Case Scenario (24-Month Wait)**: Should the de-peg not correct, the bPsiDP tokens can still be redeemed for their full UST value at the end of the 24-month lock-up period from the pylon pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. During this 24-month waiting period, users continue to earn Nexus token rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> While this presents an [[arbitrage_opportunities_in_cryptocurrency | arbitrage opportunity]], a 24-month wait is considered "very, very, very long" in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The de-peg might be a result of bearish market conditions causing people to sell off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

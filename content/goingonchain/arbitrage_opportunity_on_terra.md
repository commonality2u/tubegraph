An [[arbitrage_opportunities_in_nfts | arbitrage opportunity]] currently exists on the Terra blockchain, specifically involving the Nexus Protocol and its liquid Pylon Pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This opportunity arises from a de-peg in the value of a specific receipt token.

## Understanding the Liquid Pylon Pool

The Nexus Protocol's liquid Pylon Pool requires users to deposit UST for a 24-month lock-up period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. During this period, participants earn Nexus tokens as rewards, with a current Annual Percentage Rate (APR) of approximately 15.73% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

The key distinction of the liquid Pylon Pool compared to a regular Pylon Pool is the issuance of a receipt token called bPsiDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This bPsiDP token represents the locked UST deposit and can be swapped for UST on [[Comparisons between Astroport and other AMMs like Terraswap and Uniswap | Terraswap]] if a user wishes to exit their position early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## The De-Peg Phenomenon

Currently, the bPsiDP token is experiencing a de-peg, meaning its value is lower than the UST it represents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. For instance, an investment of $100 UST has been observed to yield $128 in bPsiDP tokens, indicating a de-peg of about 28-30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This suggests that for every $100 UST paid, the user receives bPsiDP representing $128.973 UST deposited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Leveraging the Arbitrage

To take advantage of this situation, participants generally need to be bullish on the Nexus token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Two primary strategies can be employed:

1.  **Waiting for De-Peg Resolution**:
    One approach is to acquire bPsiDP at the de-pegged price and wait for the de-peg to resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. If the bPsiDP token recovers its peg closer to its underlying value, the holder can then swap it back for UST at a profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

2.  **Holding for 24 Months**:
    In the worst-case scenario where the de-peg does not resolve, the holder can opt to wait for the full 24-month lock-up period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. After 24 months, the initial deposited UST amount (e.g., $128 from an original $100 investment) will be redeemable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. During this waiting period, Nexus tokens are continuously earned as rewards, further compounding the potential returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

> [!WARNING]
> While this presents an [[arbitrage_opportunities_in_nfts | arbitrage opportunity]], a 24-month waiting period is considered a very long duration in the volatile cryptocurrency market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Speculated Causes of De-Peg

The de-peg is speculated to be a result of bearish market conditions, leading some users to sell their bPsiDP tokens and create the observed discrepancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

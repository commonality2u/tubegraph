BNB (Binance Coin) was the cryptocurrency involved in a specific scam detailed in a YouTube video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Scam Involving BNB
A scam channel on YouTube promised users that they could create a bot to "front-run" transactions on PancakeSwap, guaranteeing a profit of at least 10 BNB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

### How the Scam Operated
1.  **Initial Hook**: The scam channel had 12,000 followers and many positive comments, leading people to believe it was legitimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
2.  **Engagement**: Individuals would message the scammer on Discord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
3.  **The "Test"**: Victims were asked to test the bot with "some BNB" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. When the bot inevitably failed, the scammer would claim insufficient BNB was provided to "trigger the front-running" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
4.  **Psychological Trick**: The scammer then requested more BNB, leveraging the victim's desire to recover their initial capital and earn the promised 10 BNB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Red Flags of the Scam
Several indicators pointed to the fraudulent nature of the operation:
*   The YouTube channel had 2,000 followers but only one video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   All comments were suspiciously positive, with no negative feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   The provided code was designed to trigger a transaction to an unknown wallet, allowing the scammer to steal funds without the user's explicit knowledge of the destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Users are advised against blindly copying and pasting such code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

One individual lost their initial BNB due to this scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Awareness of such scams is encouraged to prevent others from falling victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

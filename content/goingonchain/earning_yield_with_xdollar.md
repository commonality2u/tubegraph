[[overview_of_xdollar_protocol | xDollar]] is a lending protocol that enables users to borrow stablecoins with a low collateral ratio and zero percent interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While there is a one-time fixed fee for borrowing, the zero percent interest can be beneficial for long-term loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

xDollar is a crypto-backed stablecoin platform that aims to be multi-chain and multi-collateral, allowing users to borrow stablecoins using assets like MATIC, AVAX, or ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The collateral ratio is notably low at 110% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Yield-Earning Strategies on xDollar

xDollar offers several ways to earn yield or benefit from its protocol:

### 1. Providing Liquidity to the Stability Pool (xPool)
Users can provide xIM (xDollar's stablecoin for v2) to the stability pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This pool holds xIM and SPACE tokens (the protocol token) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. When borrowers' positions are liquidated due to a low collateral ratio, the xIM in this pool is used to purchase the liquidated assets, such as MATIC or ETH, at a discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. By depositing xIM, users can earn more ETH and SPACE tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### 2. Staking SPACE Tokens (xStake)
Staking SPACE, the protocol token for xDollar v2, allows users to earn xSPACE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. xSPACE is a governance token, granting holders the ability to participate in governance votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Additionally, stakers earn a cut of the protocol's revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. The amount of xSPACE received increases with a longer lock-up period for the staked SPACE tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### 3. Yield Farming (xFarm)
The xFarm feature allows users to farm SPACE tokens by staking their xIM 3-Curve LP tokens obtained via Curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### 4. Arbitrage Opportunities via Redemption
Users can participate in arbitrage events through the redemption feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. For instance, if xUSD (the stablecoin for xDollar v1) de-pegs to $0.90, a user can provide xUSD, which is valued at $1.00 by the protocol, to earn profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. While often carried out by bots, individual users can also perform this arbitrage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Redemption is distinct from repaying a loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Current State and Future Plans
Currently, [[xdollar_v1_and_v2_differences | xDollar v2]] is deployed only on Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. The team is working to onboard more Layer 2 solutions and protocols, with plans to expand v2 to other chains like Polygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

[[introduction_to_vader_protocol | Vader Protocol]] is a DeFi all-in-one protocol that incorporates elements from Thorchain and Luna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. It functions as an Automated Market Maker (AMM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Team and Community

The team behind Vader is anonymous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. The community lead is identified as Dogs Mervin, whose Twitter account is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. For further information and engagement, individuals can follow their Discord and Twitter channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

## Vader Tokenomics

The tokenomics of Vader involve a unique structure for early investors and specific allocations for the team and ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### vE Holders (Early Investors)
Early investors are referred to as "vE holders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. These investors took their ETH (Ether) and burned it to mint vE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. They then exchange their vE for Vader tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. The distribution for vE holders is 50% upfront, with the remaining 50% vesting over one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. The vesting period, however, is considered by some to be relatively short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

### Allocations
*   **Team Allocation:** The team receives 10% of the token supply with a two-year linear vesting schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Ecosystem and Liquidity Incentive:** The remaining tokens are allocated for ecosystem development and liquidity incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This includes the allocation used for [[Vaders use of bond sales and its impact | bond sales]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## USDB Stablecoin and Vader Token Dynamics

Vader features its own stablecoin called USDB, which serves as the base asset for its liquidity pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The supply of Vader is directly tied to the supply of USDB, operating similarly to the mechanics of Luna and UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Pegging Mechanism
*   **USDB at Peg:** One USDB is designed to equal one USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **USDB above Peg (> $1):** If USDB's value goes above one dollar, Vader supply is burned to mint more USDB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This increases the supply of USDB, bringing its value back to the peg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Simultaneously, the reduced supply of Vader causes its price to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **USDB below Peg (< $1):** If USDB's value falls below one dollar, USDB supply is burned to mint Vader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This lowers the supply of USDB, bringing its value back to the peg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. However, this also increases the supply of Vader, causing its price to drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

In summary, higher demand for USDB generally leads to a better price for Vader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The demand for USDB is driven by its role as the base asset for providing liquidity on the Vader AMM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## [[Vaders use of bond sales and its impact | Bond Sales]]

To protect its liquidity from leaving the protocol, Vader utilizes [[Vaders use of bond sales and its impact | bond sales]], similar to Olympus Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This mechanism allows the Vader protocol to buy back its own liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

Traditionally, AMM projects would offer tokens to liquidity providers (LPs) to encourage them to provide liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. However, LPs often "farm and dump" these tokens, then move to other pools, negatively impacting the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

To counter this, Vader purchases liquidity directly from LPs through its [[Vaders use of bond sales and its impact | Vader bond sales]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. LPs sell their liquidity pool tokens to the protocol and receive Vader tokens at a discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This strategy ensures the protocol itself owns the liquidity pool tokens, preventing liquidity from leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

The Vader tokens sold through [[Vaders use of bond sales and its impact | bond sales]] come from the community liquidity incentive allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. These sales occur at fixed times and are not perpetual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Vader's first bond sale sold out within 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

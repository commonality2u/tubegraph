Sudoswap is a new NFT marketplace that operates differently from traditional platforms like OpenSea, LooksRare, and Minted, especially concerning fees and royalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. While traditional marketplaces are based on auctions and order books, [[understanding_sudoswaps_automated_market_maker_amm_model | Sudoswap is an Automated Market Maker (AMM)]], similar to Uniswap, with pricing based on formulas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This difference in operational model leads to distinct fee structures.

## Traditional NFT Marketplaces (e.g., OpenSea)

Traditional NFT marketplaces like OpenSea charge a platform fee and allow creators to set royalty fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Platform Fee**: OpenSea charges a platform fee of 2.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
*   **Creator Royalty Fee**: Creators can set a royalty fee of up to 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. For example, some creators may set this fee at 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

## Sudoswap's Fee Structure

Sudoswap implements a different fee model primarily designed to benefit traders and [[market_making_and_trading_fees_on_sudoswap | market makers]].
*   **Platform Fee**: Sudoswap charges a platform fee of 0.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. This is 2% lower than OpenSea's fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   **Royalty Fees**: Sudoswap has no royalty fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. This means creators do not receive royalties from secondary sales on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

## Impact of Fee Differences

The absence of royalty fees and the lower platform fee on Sudoswap have several implications:

*   **For Traders**: Traders prefer Sudoswap because they do not have to pay royalty fees when setting up a pool or engaging in trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This allows them to keep more of the swap fees they earn as [[market_making_and_trading_fees_on_sudoswap | liquidity providers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **For Creators**: Creators generally dislike Sudoswap's model due to the lack of royalty fees, which impacts their passive income from NFT sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. For example, if a collection has a floor price of 72 ETH and a 5% royalty fee, creators would earn approximately 6.45 ETH per trade on a traditional marketplace, which does not happen on Sudoswap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Floor Price**: Due to the reduction in platform fees and the absence of royalty fees, the floor price for NFTs on Sudoswap can sometimes be lower than on OpenSea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Market Dynamics**: If few people set up pools on Sudoswap, there might be less selection of NFTs, and the floor price may not move significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

Sudoswap has seen growing traction, with a total volume of approximately $20 million and around 12,000 users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. The platform also accumulates total platform fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

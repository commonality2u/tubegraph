Hundred Finance is a multi-chain lending and borrowing platform, similar to Compound, currently operating on several networks, including the Fantom network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. It allows users to execute various strategies to earn yield.

## Yield-Earning Strategies on Hundred Finance

There are several ways to earn yield on Hundred Finance, including various leverage strategies:

### 1. Supply Assets and Borrow Stablecoins (Yield Farming Loop)
This strategy involves supplying an asset as collateral, borrowing a stablecoin, and then re-supplying the borrowed stablecoin back into the platform to earn additional yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. For example, a user can supply ETH as collateral, borrow MIM, and then supply the MIM back into Hundred Finance to earn an 11.11% supply and stake reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The stake reward is paid in HND tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This approach aims to make an asset like ETH "work harder" than simply staking it for a lower percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

#### Boosting Yield with veHND
To significantly increase the APR, such as to 27%, users can buy HND tokens and lock them up to receive veHND <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This veHND can then be used to vote on gauges, directing rewards to specific pools (e.g., the MIM pool) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. A boost calculator is available, with a maximum boost of 2.5x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. For instance, staking $3,000 and locking 300 HND for four years can achieve a 2.5x boost, while locking for one year yields a 1.46x boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### 2. [[backstop_provision_in_defi_platforms | Backstop Provision]]
Users can participate in providing liquidity for the platform to execute liquidations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. By supplying USDC for this purpose, participants can earn an estimated 8.79% eAPR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### 3. Leverage Long and Leverage Short
Hundred Finance allows for both [[leveraged_trading_on_polygon_chain | leveraged long]] and short positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

#### Leverage Long
To leverage long an asset, users supply a crypto asset (e.g., ETH), borrow a stablecoin (e.g., USDC), and then use that stablecoin to buy more of the crypto asset they wish to long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. If the price of the asset increases, the user can sell the asset, repay the stablecoin loan, and keep the profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

#### Leverage Short
To leverage short an asset, users supply either a stablecoin or another crypto asset (e.g., ETH), borrow the crypto asset they want to short (e.g., BTC), and then immediately sell the borrowed asset for a stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. If the price of the shorted asset decreases, the user can withdraw the stablecoins, buy back the asset at a lower price, and repay the loan, profiting from the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Hundred Finance provides documentation with examples and numbers for these strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### 4. Provide Liquidity
Users can provide liquidity to pools, such as a pool with a proportion of 60% HND, 20% FTM, and 20% USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This can result in a combined APR of 110% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### 5. Use Lendi
Lendi is a specific deployment by Hundred Finance where the team borrows USDC from users, using HND as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This allows the team to provide liquidity on the HND-WFTM pool in Solidly to receive SOLID emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Users providing USDC to Lendi can earn 34.25% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Rewards can be claimed under the "claim HND" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This is considered a strong yield, especially for stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

These strategies demonstrate the potential for earning yield and executing leverage on DeFi platforms like Hundred Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

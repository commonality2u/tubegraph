Following the collapse of Terra's ecosystem, Do Kwon introduced a new plan to revive the network [00:00:14]. This plan involves a hard fork of the existing blockchain [00:00:18].

## Do Kwon's New Plan for Terra
The new plan renames the current Luna as Luna Classic and introduces a new Terra, which will be called Luna and will not include a stablecoin [00:00:18]. The new Luna tokens are slated for an airdrop to existing Luna Classic holders, stakers, and even UST holders [00:00:30].

A critical component of this new chain's viability is the retention of app developers [00:00:38]. Without developers building on the new chain, its value could be compromised [00:00:44].

### Airdrop Details
For example, 25% of the new Luna tokens are specifically allocated to UST holders at launch [00:00:51]. While the airdrop is scheduled for around 4 AM on May 27th [00:01:01], most of these allocations will be vested [00:01:05]. UST holders, for instance, will only receive 10% of their allocation at unlock, with the remaining amount vested over two years [00:01:08].

## Luna Guard Foundation (LFG) Reserves
The Luna Guard Foundation (LFG), which had previously sold its Bitcoin (BTC) reserves to support UST [00:01:17], has since disclosed its remaining assets [00:01:23]. The total remaining asset pool is approximately $300 million [00:01:31]. These funds are designated to compensate remaining UST users, prioritizing the smallest holders first [00:01:38].

## Challenges and Trust Considerations
The new hard fork introduces a chain without a stablecoin, which is seen as a significant downside [00:01:50]. A primary concern revolves around trust in Do Kwon and his team [00:01:57].

There are also questions about how many developers will remain with the Terra ecosystem, especially given that other chains like Polygon, Juno, and Phantom are actively trying to attract Terra projects and their developers [00:02:03].

Concerns have also been raised about how the LFG managed their BTC holdings [00:02:16]. It is suggested that the BTC could have been used to compensate UST holders directly rather than being sold in an attempt to support UST on the open market, which might have inadvertently provided an exit opportunity for large holders ("whales") [00:02:19].

Despite the challenges, one strong and interesting aspect of Terra that remains is its user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) [00:02:36]. The experience of using the Terra wallet is noted as significantly better compared to Metamask [00:02:42]. If another chain could replicate this superior user experience, it would represent a substantial advantage [00:02:46].

The [[understanding_the_ethereum_merge | Merge]] marks a significant transition for Ethereum, moving it from a Proof of Work (PoW) system to a full Proof of Stake (PoS) system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. However, a common misconception is that this change will lead to lower gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Technically, the [[understanding_the_ethereum_merge | Merge]] will not lower gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Why Gas Fees Will Not Decrease

The primary reason gas fees will not change is due to the nature of the [[understanding_the_ethereum_merge | Merge]]'s modifications and how gas fees are calculated on the Ethereum blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Blockchain Layers

Blockchains like Ethereum consist of three main layers: the execution layer, the consensus layer, and the data availability layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The [[understanding_the_ethereum_merge | Merge]] specifically changes the consensus layer, transitioning it from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Gas fees, however, are paid for usage on the execution layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Since the execution layer remains unchanged by the [[understanding_the_ethereum_merge | Merge]], there will be no direct changes to gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### Supply and Demand of Block Space

Blockchain transactions are also influenced by the basic principles of supply and demand for "block space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. If more people want to use a particular block space, the gas fee will be higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. An example of this is the increase in Fantom's gas fees when many users piled into Solidly for farming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Block Size and Application Complexity

Gas fees are also affected by the Ethereum block size and the complexity of decentralized applications (dApps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. After the London upgrade (around August), Ethereum's block size became variable instead of fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Additionally, more complex dApps use more transactions, thus influencing gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. These factors, which are not directly altered by the [[understanding_the_ethereum_merge | Merge]], contribute to why there are no major changes to gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

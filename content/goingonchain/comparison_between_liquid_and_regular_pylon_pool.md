The Nexus Liquid Pylon Pool on the Terra protocol offers a distinct investment opportunity compared to the regular Pylon Pool. The primary difference lies in the liquidity provided by a unique receipt token.

## Nexus Liquid Pylon Pool Mechanics

The Nexus Liquid Pylon Pool is a 24-month pool where users deposit UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. During this 24-month lock-up period, participants receive Nexus tokens as rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Currently, the reward is approximately 15.73% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The pool behaves like a bond, meaning if you deposit $1,000, you are expected to receive $1,000 back at the end of the term, plus accumulated rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

### Key Distinction: The `bpsiDP` Receipt Token

The main differentiating factor of the [[nexus_liquid_pylon_pool_mechanics | Nexus Liquid Pylon Pool]] from a regular Pylon Pool is the issuance of a receipt token called `bpsiDP` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This token provides an exit strategy for investors who might regret their 24-month lock-up, as `bpsiDP` can be sold on Terrawap for UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Arbitrage Opportunity: The De-peg Situation

Currently, there is a de-peg occurring with the `bpsiDP` token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This means the `bpsiDP` token is trading at a significant discount relative to the UST deposited. For example, $100 USD can be used to acquire $128 worth of `bpsiDP` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Although only $100 was paid, Pylon records the deposited amount as $128.973 USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This represents an ongoing de-peg of approximately 28% to 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### How to Take Advantage

This situation presents an arbitrage opportunity, but it requires a bullish outlook on the Nexus token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The strategy involves:

1.  **Buying the De-pegged `bpsiDP`**: Acquire `bpsiDP` at its discounted rate.
2.  **Waiting for De-peg Resolution**: Hope for the `bpsiDP` price to return closer to its peg (e.g., from 98 cents to 120 or 127 cents) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Worst-Case Scenario

Even if the de-peg does not resolve, the investor can wait for the full 24-month term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. At the end of 24 months, the original deposited amount (e.g., $128) will be returned, even though only $100 was initially paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Additionally, investors continue to earn Nexus token rewards throughout the 24-month period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Risk

The primary risk associated with this strategy is the significant waiting period, as 24 months is considered a very long time in the fast-paced crypto market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. The de-peg may be a result of a bearish market causing people to sell off their positions, creating the discrepancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

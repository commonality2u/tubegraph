Stablecoins are a crucial part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. There are generally three main types of stablecoins, each distinguished by its underlying mechanism and collateral. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>

## 1. Fiat-Backed Stablecoins
Fiat-backed stablecoins are the most straightforward type. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   **Mechanism:** These stablecoins are backed 1:1 by traditional fiat currency reserves (like USD) held by a centralized entity. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> This means that for every stablecoin in circulation, there is an equivalent amount of fiat currency held in reserve. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   **Example:** USDC is a prominent example, where for every USDC, one USD is controlled by Circle, the company that owns USDC. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>

## 2. Algorithmic Stablecoins
Algorithmic stablecoins do not rely on traditional fiat or cryptocurrency collateral in the same way. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>
*   **Mechanism:** They use smart contracts and algorithms to maintain their peg by dynamically adjusting the supply of the stablecoin in response to demand. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a> This often involves a dual-token system where one token is the stablecoin and the other is a volatility token that absorbs price fluctuations.
*   **Example:** Terra UST was a famous algorithmic stablecoin, where the supply of UST was backed by the supply of Luna. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>

## 3. Crypto-Backed Stablecoins
Crypto-backed stablecoins use other cryptocurrencies as collateral. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>
*   **Mechanism:** To ensure stability and account for the volatility of the underlying crypto collateral, these stablecoins are often over-collateralized. This means that a higher value of cryptocurrency is locked up than the value of the stablecoin borrowed or minted. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>
*   **Example:** DAI is a well-known crypto-backed stablecoin. To borrow $500 worth of DAI, one might need to collateralize $1000 worth of ETH, resulting in a collateral ratio of 200%. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>
*   **X-Dollar (XIM):** The X-Dollar protocol's stablecoin, XIM (formerly xUSD), falls into this category. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a> It aims to be multi-chain and multi-collateral, allowing users to borrow stablecoins using assets like MATIC, Avalanche (AVAX), or Ethereum (ETH) with a low collateral ratio of 110% and zero percent interest, though a one-time fixed fee applies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>

A Decentralized Exchange (DEX) is a platform where users can trade cryptocurrencies and provide liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Examples include PancakeSwap and SushiSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. DEX tokens are integral to the operation and participation within these platforms.

## Core Utilities of DEX Tokens

The typical utilities of DEX tokens include:
*   **Governance Power**: Token holders can vote on proposals and changes to the DEX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Staking for Yield**: Users can stake their tokens to earn additional yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. For example, staking CAKE tokens can earn more yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Launchpad Participation**: DEX tokens can be staked to participate in Initial Farm Offerings (IFOs) or launchpads for new projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. For instance, holding CAKE allows participation in IFOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Stakeholder Interactions and Token Usage

The different [[stakeholders_in_decentralized_exchanges | stakeholders]] on a DEX interact with DEX tokens in various ways:

### Liquidity Providers (LPs)
LPs contribute tokens to pools to facilitate trading, earning a cut of the trading fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Providing liquidity can also come with additional incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. In some cases, to earn more yield through liquidity provision, users might need to purchase the DEX token to participate in a specific security pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This mechanism benefits both the protocol and the DEX by improving liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Stakers
Stakers either acquire DEX tokens from the open market or farm them, then stake them to earn more yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Stakers can also earn more DEX tokens through their staking activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Challenges with DEX Token Value

The presenter notes a personal strategy to avoid buying DEX tokens directly, preferring to farm them instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This is due to a perceived misalignment of incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Many participants who farm DEX tokens receive them as external incentives, and may not have purchased them from the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. When the market experiences fear or downturns, these participants are likely to be among the first to sell or "dump" their farmed DEX tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This behavior has been observed in the price performance of tokens like CAKE and SUSHI during market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This highlights the [[challenges_of_investing_in_dex_tokens | challenges of investing in DEX tokens]].

However, the dynamics for DEX tokens are evolving, with more people becoming willing to hold them due to phenomena like [[impact_of_crypto_bribes_on_dex_token_value | crypto bribes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

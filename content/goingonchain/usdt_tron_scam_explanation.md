This article details a specific type of [[common_cryptocurrency_scam_tactics | common cryptocurrency scam tactic]] revolving around USDT on the Tron network, designed to siphon gas fees from unsuspecting victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## How the Scam Works

The scam typically begins with an individual contacting the victim, usually through [[Social media and Telegram scams | social media]] platforms like [[Social media and Telegram scams | Telegram]] or Instagram (IG) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

1.  **Initial Contact & Plea for Help**: The scammer DMs the victim, claiming to be ill or unable to withdraw assets from their wallet due to difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. They then provide their wallet address and seed phrase, asking for help to withdraw the assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
2.  **Wallet Contents**: Upon loading the provided wallet, the victim will observe a significant amount of USDT (e.g., $1135) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. However, there will be no Tron (TRX), which is required for [[Gas fees siphoning in crypto scams | gas fees]] to perform transactions on the Tron network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
3.  **The Trap**: The victim, intending to help, will then load TRX into the wallet to cover the [[Gas fees siphoning in crypto scams | gas fees]] for the USDT withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
4.  **Immediate Siphoning**: The moment TRX is deposited into the wallet, it is immediately sent to another wallet controlled by the scammer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This happens automatically, making the victim's loaded gas fee disappear without any successful USDT withdrawal.

## Technical Explanation of [[How to recognize scam wallets | Scam Wallets]]

The core of this scam lies in the manipulation of wallet permissions on the Tron network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

*   **Inspecting a Scam Wallet**: When a victim loads the scammer's provided wallet (e.g., address ending in `gt9h`), they can check its details on TronScan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. By looking at the "Account" section, it's revealed that the "owner permission" of the wallet is not the public address provided (`gt9h`), but a different address (e.g., `w19c`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The "active permission" also belongs to this separate, hidden address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Attempting to Change Permissions**: A victim might try to "edit access" to put their own address as the permission holder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. However, clicking "save" on this action costs 100 TRX, which is also immediately sent to the scammer's wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Comparison to a Normal Wallet**: In a legitimate, normal wallet, the "owner permission" and "active permission" addresses are identical to the wallet's public address (e.g., `knifi au` for both) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the setup of a scam wallet.

## Scammer's Profit and Awareness

Scammers continue to accumulate [[Gas fees siphoning in crypto scams | gas fees]] from victims falling for this trick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Any TRX transferred into the scam wallet is automatically redirected to the scammer's actual wallet (e.g., `2qpe`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. This wallet quickly accumulates significant amounts, demonstrating that people are actively falling victim to this scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. For example, in a short period, over $2,000 worth of TRX was accumulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

While some suggest this scam might also target other scammers, many ordinary people also fall victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. It is crucial for individuals in the crypto space to be aware of such tactics to avoid losing their funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Always exercise [[crypto_scam_awareness | caution]] as there are many scams operating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

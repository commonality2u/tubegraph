The importance of securing crypto assets outside of centralized exchanges (CeX) has been highlighted by incidents in the crypto space, such as the Crypto.com and Gate.io transfer event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While the Crypto.com CEO stated a 220k ETH transfer to Gate.io on October 21st was a mistake and the funds were recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, this incident fueled speculation about exchanges assisting each other for "proof of reserve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Although Gate.io clarified that their October 19th proof of reserves did not include the Crypto.com deposit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, such events underscore the critical need for users to hold their own assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The principle "not your key, not your coin" emphasizes the importance of self-custody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Many individuals are unaware of how to securely store their crypto tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Therefore, it is essential to remove assets from centralized exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## [[types_of_crypto_wallets | Types of Non-Custodial Wallets]]

Non-custodial wallets give users complete control over their private keys and, consequently, their funds. A crucial responsibility when using these wallets is taking care of your keys, as losing them means losing all your assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. These wallets also offer more control, such as the ability to add networks and configurations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Cold Wallets

Ideally, the best method for storing crypto assets is using a [[comparison_between_hot_wallet_and_cold_wallet | cold wallet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Ledger is a commonly used brand, but many different brands of cold wallets are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Hot Wallets

*   **MetaMask**: This wallet supports ETH, BSC, Tron, Polygon, and all EVM chains, including AVAX, FTM, Matic, and Cronos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. However, it cannot be used for Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Blue Wallet**: This is specifically for Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

While it supports 65 blockchains and covers most commonly owned assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, it offers fewer configuration options, such as the inability to add custom networks or set custom RPCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

From: [[goingonchain]] <br/> 

Astroport is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) designed for the [[Terra]] blockchain, functioning similarly to SushiSwap. Its primary purpose is to facilitate decentralized exchange between various tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Why Terra Needs Another AMM
Despite the existence of Terraswap, [[Terra]] required a more robust and versatile AMM solution. The limitations of existing platforms highlight the necessity for Astroport's advanced features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

### Limitations of Terraswap
[[comparison_between_astroport_and_terraswap | Terraswap]], while functional, was originally built to support Miro Protocol and was not intended as a comprehensive AMM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. It offers only basic functionalities, lacking features like chart trends or detailed APY displays common in more advanced AMMs such as SpiritSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Issues with Traditional AMM Pools
Most traditional AMMs, including Terraswap, utilize a single type of product pool known as the "constant product" formula, popularized by UniSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. While effective for highly volatile pairs like Bitcoin and Ethereum, this [[how_amm_automated_market_maker_works | AMM]] approach is not ideal for stablecoin pools or newly launched tokens, often leading to significant slippage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Loss of Liquidity Provider Benefits
A significant drawback of providing liquidity on Terraswap is the forfeiture of native protocol benefits. For example, providing ANC-UST liquidity on Terraswap means losing the specific benefits associated with the Anchor protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Astroport's Solutions and Innovations
Astroport aims to address these deficiencies by offering a more comprehensive and user-friendly experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Enhanced User Interface and Experience
Astroport provides a superior UI/UX, featuring chart trends and a more intuitive interface compared to a simple swap screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Multiple Pool Types
Moving beyond the single constant product pool, Astroport introduces three different types of pools. This diversification is designed to optimize exchange rates and minimize slippage for users, accommodating various asset classes including stablecoins and new tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Astro Generators
[[innovative_features_of_astroport_like_astro_generators | Astro Generators]] are a key innovation, enabling "double farming." For instance, when providing ANC-UST liquidity to an Astro Generator, a proxy smart contract connects the liquidity to Anchor, allowing users to earn both the Astroport token and the Anchor benefits simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Team Behind Astroport
Astroport is developed by a collaborative group known as "Astroport Joint Ventures," comprising members from prominent entities like Delphi Digital, IDEO, and Terraform Labs (TFL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Tokenomics and Distribution
[[tokenomics_and_distribution_for_astroport | Astroport's token distribution]] allocates 55% of tokens to liquidity pool providers over four years, while the core team and investors receive 30% over three years. The platform also features two sub-tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Launch Details and Token Drop Strategy
Astroport was undergoing auditing and was anticipated to launch around mid-November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Instead of an Initial DEX Offering (IDO), Astroport implemented a three-phase [[astroport_launch_details_and_token_drop_strategy | token drop strategy]]:

1.  **Phase 1 (DeFi Participation):** Tokens were allocated to users who participated in [[Terra]] DeFi activities, likely related to farming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
2.  **Phase 2 (Terraswap Migration):** Users who migrated their liquidity from Terraswap to Astroport were rewarded with tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
3.  **Phase 3 (Astroport UST Pool Commitment):** Tokens earned in phases one and two could be committed to the Astroport UST pool to earn additional tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

Phases two and three included lockup periods, allowing users to choose the duration, similar to Pylon Protocol's vesting periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

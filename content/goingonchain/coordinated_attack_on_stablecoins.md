The significant downfall of Luna and UST was attributed to several contributing factors, with a coordinated attack being the primary one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This event led to a personal loss for the speaker, who had a large position in Luna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## The Attack Mechanism

The coordinated attack involved the attackers acquiring 1 billion UST and then loaning 3 billion BTC with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. After selling these assets, it triggered a bank run on Anchor Protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This action caused UST to depeg, leading to widespread worry and selling among users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Terra's UST Mechanism and Vicious Cycle

A secondary factor contributing to the collapse was Terra's UST mechanism itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. When users sold UST, it inherently minted more Luna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This created a "dead loop" or "vicious cycle": the more people sold UST, the greater the supply of Luna, further driving down its price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

The Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) attempted to stabilize UST by using its Bitcoin reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. However, their continuous selling of BTC to stabilize UST inadvertently caused panic in the broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Broader Market Impact and Contributing Factors

The selling of Bitcoin by LFG contributed to a general panic in the entire crypto market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This situation was exacerbated by negative macroeconomic events, including unfavorable economic data and persistent high inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Furthermore, the U.S. Treasury Secretary commented on UST and called for [[Regulatory implications and future of stablecoins | regulation]] of stablecoins, adding to market uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Aftermath and Short-Term Outlook

Following these events, UST depegged and Luna's price fell below 10 cents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Terra's immediate priority, based on their latest tweets, was to restore the UST peg rather than support Luna's price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. To achieve this, they continued burning UST, which consequently minted more Luna, further driving down Luna's price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

In addition to Luna's decline, Bitcoin continued to fall due to large sell-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Even [[Types of stablecoins and their distinctions | USDT]], another major stablecoin, briefly lost its peg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The speaker notes the challenging nature of this period for crypto investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

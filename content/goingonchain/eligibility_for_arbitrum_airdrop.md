It is widely believed that Arbitrum will introduce its own token, similar to Optimism's OP token, and that users will need to complete specific tasks to qualify for a potential airdrop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. However, it's important to note that this is currently [[speculations_about_an_arbitrum_airdrop | pure speculation]] regarding an airdrop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Historical Context: Arbitrum Odyssey

Initially, a program called [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] was launched, which involved several tasks for early users to complete to qualify for rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. One of the tasks included [[bridging_process_and_options_for_arbitrum | bridging]] assets, which would reward users with an NFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The [[arbitrum_odyssey_campaign_overview | Arbitrum Odyssey program]] was designed to be an eight-week campaign with new tasks released each week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

The [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey program]] was paused due to excessive traffic and a spike in gas prices, largely attributed to [[speculations_about_an_arbitrum_airdrop | airdrop speculation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The proposed solution to this traffic issue was the introduction of [[arbitrum_nitro_and_its_potential_benefits | Arbitrum Nitro]], an upgrade designed to handle more traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. While [[arbitrum_nitro_upgrade | Nitro]] went live on August 31st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, the [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey program]] did not immediately resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Current Engagement: Discord Role Quests

Currently, there is a program that involves "quests to earn roles" on the Arbitrum Discord server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. While the official communication states this is solely for obtaining Discord roles and "literally nothing" else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, approximately 50,000 people have participated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Participation Details

*   **Cost**: The estimated cost to participate is around 0.02 ETH plus gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: Completing all tasks grants access to different roles on the Arbitrum Discord server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Platform**: Participation involves connecting your wallet, Discord account, and Twitter handle on guild.xyz/arbitrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Tasks**: Participants need to complete various tasks, primarily involving purchasing small amounts of specific tokens (e.g., 0.01 JMX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Most of these tokens are available on Uniswap or SushiSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### Important Considerations for Tasks

*   **Arbitrum Odyssey Task**: For those who wish to complete the [[arbitrum_odyssey_week_2_overview | Arbitrum Odyssey]]-related task, even though the program is over, it requires [[collecting_nfts_and_airdrops_in_arbitrum_odyssey | purchasing an NFT]] from OpenSea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Token Safety**: When purchasing tokens on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, it is crucial to avoid pasting the token name directly into the search bar due to the risk of encountering scam tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
    *   **Safer Method**: The recommended approach is to view the token on an explorer, copy its contract address, and then paste the contract address into Uniswap to ensure you are selecting the correct token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Time Commitment**: Completing all tasks can take approximately 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Verification**: After making a purchase, returning to Guild.xyz will refresh the page and grant access to the relevant Discord role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

The year in crypto was characterized by a significant downturn, described as "down back," with popular assets falling around 80% to 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14"></a>. This challenging environment was largely shaped by macro-economic factors and a subsequent liquidity crisis.

## The Onset: Interest Rate Hikes
The year's difficulties began to escalate in March when the Fed started to raise its [[interest_rate_hikes_and_market_impacts | interest rate hikes and market impacts]] from 0.25% to 4.375% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32"></a>. This action signified the end of "money printers" and led to risk capital flowing away, which in turn initiated a liquidity crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39"></a>.

## Cascading Failures and Market Turmoil
The [[interest_rate_hikes_and_market_impacts | interest rate hikes and market impacts]] and the subsequent liquidity crisis triggered a series of major collapses in the crypto market:
*   **Wonderland Rock**: Early in the year, around January to February, the Wonderland rock event had a significant impact, drawing the speaker into the "frog nation" narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23"></a>.
*   **Fall of Luna**: May marked a major event with the collapse of Luna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43"></a>. This failure, tied to the [[ust_mechanism_and_market_panic | UST mechanism and market panic]], led to a "House of Cards" effect, initiating a chain reaction across the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51"></a>.
*   **Celsius and 3AC**: In June, Celsius halted withdrawals, and Three Arrows Capital (3AC) faced liquidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54"></a>.
*   **FTX Collapse**: The year concluded with the significant event of FTX filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06"></a>.

## Overall Impact and Lessons
Beyond these major collapses, the market environment in 2022 was also plagued by numerous scams and frauds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14"></a>. Despite these challenges, continued belief in crypto was demonstrated by those remaining in the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19"></a>.

A key takeaway from this period of market instability and significant yield failures was the understanding that "if I do not understand the yield, where the yield is coming from, I am the yield" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38"></a>. The speaker, having been affected by Wonderland and Terra Luna, emphasized the importance of learning skills like Python and SQL to extract and better understand on-chain data for more informed decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54"></a>.

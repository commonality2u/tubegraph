[[CitaDAO platform overview | CitaDAO]] is a platform that aims to merge blockchain technology with real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. It facilitates bringing physical commercial properties on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

## Knight Governance Token

The Knight token is CitaDAO's governance token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:57">[01:55:57]</a>. Owning Knight tokens provides holders with exposure to other properties listed on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:03">[02:01:03]</a>.

## Platform Revenue

CitaDAO generates revenue by collecting two percent of all property listed on its platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:01">[01:58:01]</a>. This revenue stream is linked to the Knight governance token, as owning Knight tokens gives exposure to these listed properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:03">[02:01:03]</a>.

### The [[IRO process in CitaDAO | IRO process]] (Introducing Real Estate On-chain)

The [[IRO process in CitaDAO | IRO process]] is central to how properties are brought onto the CitaDAO platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. During an IRO, participants commit USDC into a pool, and if a minimum sum is met, real estate tokens (RET) are distributed along with rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>. The IRO rewards are distributed to participants and supporters instead of paying third-party agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:03">[01:31:03]</a>.

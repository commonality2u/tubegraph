## Incentivized Royalties

Blur features "incentivized royalties," which means that if a user chooses to give royalties, they will be rewarded with [[token_distribution_and_rewards | Blur tokens]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:04">[01:32:04]</a>. The platform uses this strategy to encourage users to list more [[overview_of_blur_nft_marketplace | NFTs]], thereby attracting more users to the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>. While it is optional to give royalties, doing so will result in an [[strategies_to_maximize_blur_token_airdrop | airdrop]] reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:06">[02:04:06]</a>.

## Loyalty Points

Blur also implements a loyalty point system, with every wallet having a loyalty point score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:02">[02:09:02]</a>. Users can achieve high loyalty points by listing their [[overview_of_blur_nft_marketplace | NFTs]] across different marketplaces while ensuring the lowest listing price is on Blur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:04">[02:11:04]</a>. A higher loyalty point score increases the odds of receiving "super rare care packages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>, which contain a significantly larger amount of [[token_distribution_and_rewards | Blur tokens]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:04">[02:22:04]</a>. These [[token_distribution_and_rewards | Blur tokens]] are expected to be distributed in January 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

[[radiant_capital_overview_and_status | Radiant Capital]] is a cross-chain money market protocol that has quickly risen to prominence on the Arbitrum Chain, ranking among the top 10 protocols with a Total Value Locked (TVL) of close to $54 million. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> It has attracted significant attention from yield farmers due to its high yields, including a locking APR of 100% and a liquidity provision (LP) APR of 542% at the time of reporting. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>

## Initial Concerns and Team Updates

Initially, concerns were raised about [[concerns_and_updates_on_radiant_capital | Radiant Capital]], including:
*   Lack of contract audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   No KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>
*   Absence of a time lock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>
*   Alleged association with Sifu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>
*   Reports of LP snipers at launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>

The [[concerns_and_updates_on_radiant_capital | Radiant]] team has addressed these concerns and implemented updates:
*   Oracle ownership was moved to a Tudor multi-sig wallet. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
*   A time lock has been added. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
*   The contract is now verified and audited. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   They clarified their stance on KYC with Off-chain Labs, indicating they are still not KYC. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>

## [[cryptocurrency_investment_strategies | Investment Strategies]] and Functionality

[[functionality_and_benefits_of_radiant_capital | Radiant Capital]] offers interesting iterations on the traditional lending protocol model. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>

### Money Market Use Cases
Typically, money markets allow users to:
1.  **Lend Assets:** Deposit assets to earn yield and money market tokens. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a> For example, depositing ETH on [[functionality_and_benefits_of_radiant_capital | Radiant]] can yield 2.54% on ETH plus an additional 5.61% APR in [[radiant_capital_overview_and_status | Radiant]] token incentives. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
2.  **Borrow Assets:** Use deposited assets as collateral to borrow other assets. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a> For instance, if bullish on ETH but lacking stablecoins, one can deposit ETH as collateral and borrow stablecoins to buy more ETH, thus increasing leverage without selling existing ETH. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>
    *   Borrowing USDC with ETH collateral on [[functionality_and_benefits_of_radiant_capital | Radiant]] incurs a borrowing cost of 3.63% but also provides a 5.31% APR incentive. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a> The total incentive for lending and borrowing can be around 10-11%. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>
3.  **Looping:** A strategy where users repeatedly deposit stablecoins, borrow, and redeposit to farm more platform tokens. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a> [[functionality_and_benefits_of_radiant_capital | Radiant]] has streamlined this process with a "one-click" looping feature. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a> Using DAI as an example with 4x leverage (looping four times), the net APY can be 32.88% with a reward APR of about 41.5%. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>

### [[radiant_capitals_unique_crosschain_borrowing_feature | Unique Cross-Chain Borrowing]]
[[radiant_capitals_unique_crosschain_borrowing_feature | Radiant]] introduces a unique cross-chain borrowing feature. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a> Unlike other markets where borrowed assets are confined to the chain they were borrowed on, [[radiant_capitals_unique_crosschain_borrowing_feature | Radiant]] allows users to borrow on one chain (e.g., Arbitrum) and bridge the asset to another chain (e.g., Polygon) if needed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a> This is facilitated by the Stargate protocol. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>

### Rewards and Vesting
All yields earned from lending, borrowing, and LP are vested for 28 days. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a> Users can choose to break the vesting period, but they will only receive 50% of their rewards, with the remaining 50% going to [[radiant_capital_overview_and_status | Radiant]] token lockers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>

### Locking Tokens
Locking [[radiant_capital_overview_and_status | Radiant]] tokens allows users to receive both platform and penalty fees. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a> However, locked tokens cannot be unstaked at any time. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a> The APR for locking was approximately 800% at the time of reporting, though this rate is dynamic. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a> This system is similar to [[cap_finance_token and its potential | Gains Finance]] on FTM, as [[radiant_capital_overview_and_status | Radiant]]'s base code forms the foundation for it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>

Platform fees, derived from users' borrowing costs, are distributed in various assets, including stablecoins, ETH, and wBTC. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>

### Providing Liquidity
For users interested in providing liquidity, the APR was about 542% at the time of reporting. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a> It is crucial to be aware of the risk of impermanent loss when providing liquidity. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a> This high APR is partly due to 20% of [[radiant_capital_overview_and_status | Radiant]] token emissions being allocated to pool rewards. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>

## [[tokenomics_and_team_structure | Tokenomics]]

The [[tokenomics_and_team_structure | tokenomics]] of [[radiant_capital_overview_and_status | Radiant Capital]] are structured primarily around incentives:
*   About 70% of tokens are allocated for incentives. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>
*   50% goes to supply and borrowing incentives. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>
*   20% goes to Pool 2 rewards. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>

Most of the token unlock schedule takes place within 24 months. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>

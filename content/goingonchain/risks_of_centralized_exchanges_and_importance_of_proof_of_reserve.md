The cryptocurrency space is dynamic, and concerns about [[importance_of_cryptocurrency_security | asset security]] on centralized exchanges (CeX) are paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Recent events have highlighted the risks associated with holding funds on these platforms.

## Risks Associated with Centralized Exchanges

A significant concern emerged when Crypto.com reportedly sent 220,000 ETH to Gate.io on October 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The CEO of Crypto.com stated this was a mistake and that they worked with Gate.io to recover the funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This incident fueled speculation that exchanges might be assisting each other by moving assets to facilitate their "proof of reserve" audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

Despite Gate.io clarifying that its proof of reserve, conducted on October 19th, did not include the Crypto.com deposit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, people continued to withdraw their funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This emphasizes the fundamental principle in crypto: "not your key is not your coin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The immediate priority for users is often to remove their assets from CeX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Importance of Proof of Reserve

While exchanges attempt to provide transparency through "proof of reserve" audits, the Crypto.com and Gate.io incident illustrates potential challenges and trust issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Such events underscore the need for verifiable and independent proof of reserve mechanisms that prevent speculative asset movements. Despite these efforts, user confidence can be shaken, leading to withdrawals.

## Mitigating Risks: Self-Custody of Crypto Assets

A significant percentage of people are unaware of how to securely store their crypto tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. To mitigate the risks associated with CeX, holding assets in non-custodial wallets is highly recommended.

### Cold Wallets

Ideally, the best way to store crypto is using a cold wallet, such as Ledger, though many other brands are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. These hardware wallets keep your private keys offline, providing a higher level of security.

### Hot Wallets

If a cold wallet is not an option, hot wallets can be used:
*   **MetaMask**: Suitable for Ethereum (ETH), Avalanche (AVAX), Fantom (FTM), Polygon (MATIC), Cronos, and other EVM-compatible chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Blue Wallet**: Used for Bitcoin (BTC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Phantom Wallet**: Used for Solana (SOL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Keplr IBC Wallet**: Used for Cosmos (ATOM) and other IBC-compatible chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

These are non-custodial wallets, meaning users retain full control over their private keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. However, this also means that if you lose your keys, your assets are permanently gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. These wallets also offer greater control, allowing users to add networks and configure settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

#### Trust Wallet
For simplicity and a multi-chain solution, Trust Wallet can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. It supports storing ETH, BTC, SOL, Cosmos, and other assets in one app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Important Considerations**:
    *   Trust Wallet is maintained and supported by Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
    *   It offers less configuration, such as the inability to add custom networks or set RPC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
    *   It supports 65 blockchains and covers most commonly owned assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
    *   **Crucially**: Trust Wallet is *only* available in a mobile version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. To use it on a desktop, you must connect via WalletConnect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
    *   **Scam Alert**: Any Trust Wallet Chrome extension found in the Chrome Web Store is a scam and is fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

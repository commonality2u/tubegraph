[[Real Yield in DeFi | Real Yield]] is an emerging concept within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This new narrative offers a different approach compared to traditional [[yield_farming_to_grow_cryptocurrency | yield farming]] strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Traditional Yield Farming

In the past, [[yield_farming_to_grow_cryptocurrency | yield farming]] often featured very high Annual Percentage Yields (APYs), sometimes exceeding 10,000% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This model was often considered "ponzu-like," where users would buy the platform's native token, lock it, and earn more of the same inflationary platform tokens, which they would then rush to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The tokens in these systems were highly inflationary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. [[Lessons from high APY yield farming | Lessons from high APY yield farming]] have shown the unsustainability of such models.

## Real Yield

[[Real Yield in DeFi | Real Yield]] protocols differentiate themselves by providing rewards in a different format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. When users engage with a [[Real Yield in DeFi | Real Yield]] protocol, token holders receive a portion of the revenue generated by the protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. These rewards are typically paid out in mainstream assets like Ethereum (ETH) or [[using_stablecoins_in_yield_farming | stablecoins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This direct distribution of protocol revenue is what defines [[Real Yield in DeFi | Real Yield]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### Examples of Real Yield Protocols

[[Examples of Real Yield Protocols | Examples of Real Yield Protocols]] include:

*   **GMX**: When staking GMX, users earn GMX tokens and also receive ETH rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **GNS**: Staking GNS can yield a 4% reward in DAI [[using_stablecoins_in_yield_farming | stablecoins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **Umami**: Depositing assets into Umami can earn ETH rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Kujira**: Now its own blockchain, staking Kujira tokens allows users to collect rewards in various asset types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Valuation Models for Real Yield Protocols

Common valuation models for [[Real Yield in DeFi | Real Yield]] protocols often involve comparing metrics to assess a protocol's revenue and fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Analysts typically calculate the fees generated from trading volume, then use a ratio to estimate the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The P/E ratio can then be used to determine if a platform is undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Tools for Data Collection

Several tools and resources can help in gathering the necessary data for valuation:

*   **Token Terminal**: Provides aggregated data for various protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Dune Analytics**: Features user-built dashboards with detailed protocol information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Protocol Statistic Pages**: Many protocols host their own dedicated statistics pages with relevant information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Key Considerations for Valuation

When evaluating [[Real Yield in DeFi | Real Yield]] protocols, several factors are crucial:

*   **Supply Figures**: Using circulating supply versus total supply can significantly alter valuation results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Expenses**: Emissions (rewards used to attract users) should be considered as expenses when calculating profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Chain Migration**: If a protocol moves to a new blockchain (e.g., dYdX moving to Cosmos), it's important to assess how likely users are to follow, considering factors like changes in security from the previous chain (like Ethereum), and new wallet and interface requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

There is no single "right" or "wrong" valuation model; the choice depends on how one chooses to construct it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

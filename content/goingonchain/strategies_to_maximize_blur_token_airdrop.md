Blur is a new NFT marketplace and aggregator that offers confirmed token airdrops to its users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The airdrop program involves collecting "care packages" that will later translate into Blur tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The Blur tokens are expected to be released in January 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Airdrop 1: Initial Eligibility

[[blur_token_airdrop_details_and_conditions | Airdrop 1]] was designed for users who had traded NFTs in the six months prior to October 19, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The number of "care packages" received depended on the trading volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Legendary care packages contain significantly more Blur tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Users had approximately 14 days from October 19 to claim their packages, with the collection period likely ending around the first week of November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### Maximizing Airdrop 2 Rewards

While there's no explicit formula for [[blur_token_airdrop_details_and_conditions | Airdrop 2]], the following strategies are shared to maximize rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>:

*   **List Blue-Chip Collections:** Listing NFTs from blue-chip collections is encouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **List Active Collections:** Focus on listing NFTs from active collections, as they generate more volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### Incentivized Royalties and Loyalty Points

[[incentivized_royalties_and_loyalty_points_on_in_blur | Blur incentivizes users]] to choose to pay royalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. If users opt to give royalties, they are rewarded with Blur tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This strategy aims to encourage more NFT listings on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

Furthermore, every wallet on Blur has a loyalty point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. To earn high loyalty points:
*   List your NFTs on Blur at the lowest price compared to other marketplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   High loyalty points increase the odds of receiving super rare care packages, which contain a significantly larger amount of Blur tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

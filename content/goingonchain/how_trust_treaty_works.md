Trust Treaty is a Web3 service built on a blockchain, designed to address the challenges faced by freelancers and independent contractors in securing fair payment and contract terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It acts as a refundable smart contract, offering a structured solution for freelance work in the decentralized space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Problem Solved by Trust Treaty

Freelancers often find themselves at a disadvantage, particularly when clients refuse to pay or when there are disagreements about work standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Without formal contracts, disputes can devolve into "your words versus my words" situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. While Web2 platforms like Upwork or Fiverr exist, Trust Treaty provides a Web3 native alternative for the growing remote workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Core Mechanism: Refundable Smart Contract

Trust Treaty functions as an escrow service where funds are locked in a smart contract until the agreed-upon terms are met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Contract Creation Process

A client initiates a contract by specifying the following details:
*   **Contract Title** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>
*   **Critical Information**: What is expected from both the client and the service provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Start and End Dates** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>
*   **Price**: The agreed-upon payment, which can be locked in USD, USDT, or USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
    *   A platform fee (tax) is applied to the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
    *   A maximum dispute cost is also set (e.g., $50), which scales down with smaller contract values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

When the client commits the payment, the funds are moved to a new wallet address secured by the Trust Treaty platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Neither the client nor the service provider has direct access to these funds until the contract is finalized or a dispute is resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Users are represented by their wallet addresses, allowing for anonymity even when hiring unknown designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

Once all details are filled, the client signs the contract, generating a unique link that can be shared with the service provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Service Provider Interaction and Finalization

Upon receiving the link, the service provider reviews the contract title, details, and settlement value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. If acceptable, the service provider signs the contract, making it effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. The platform's UI can be used for communication between parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

When the work is completed, the service provider requests payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. If the client confirms everything is in order, they finalize the agreement, releasing the funds to the service provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### [[dispute_resolution_process_in_trust_treaty | Dispute Resolution Process]]

Should issues arise, either party can open a dispute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Both the client and service provider submit their evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Two independent dispute agents are assigned to analyze the situation and provide their assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   If both agents agree, their decision is final, and funds are either sent to the provider or refunded to the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   If the agents disagree, a manager is called in to render the final decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Use Cases

Trust Treaty's escrow-like functionality is particularly useful for upcoming remote work in the Web3 space, offering a secure way to manage contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Risks and Considerations

While beneficial, there are risks associated with using Trust Treaty:
*   **Platform Risk**: If the Trust Treaty platform ceases to exist, the funds held in its secured wallet addresses could also be lost, as neither the client nor the service provider holds the keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Dispute Decision Bias**: Although dispute agents make independent decisions, human bias can still be introduced into the resolution process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

As of the transcript, Trust Treaty does not yet have its own token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

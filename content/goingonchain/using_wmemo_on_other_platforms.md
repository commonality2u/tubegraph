Holding wMEMO allows for a variety of uses across different DeFi platforms, expanding its utility beyond just holding [[what_is_wmemo | Wonderland]] assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. These applications enable users to potentially increase their yield or engage in other financial strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Abracadabra

wMEMO can be used on the [[abracadabra_platform_and_mim_stablecoin | Abracadabra]] platform to borrow the MIM stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. After borrowing, users can further leverage or "degen" with the MIM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## SushiSwap

Users can become a liquidity provider on [[sushi_swap_platform_and_liquidity_provision | SushiSwap]] by pairing their wMEMO with MIM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Pendle Service (Structured Products)

For those interested in structured products, wMEMO can be "broken apart" using the Pendle service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

*   **OT (Original Token)**: Represents the time value of wMEMO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **YT (Yield Token)**: Represents the yield value of wMEMO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

If a user anticipates a drop in [[what_is_wmemo | Wonderland]]'s interest rates, they can sell their YT and purchase OT to lock in their yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Tracking wMEMO Value

The value of wMEMO can be tracked using a service called "The Bank" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This eliminates the need to constantly [[how_to_convert_time_and_memo_to_wmemo | wrap and unwrap]] wMEMO just to check its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Eligibility for Airdrops

Holding wMEMO makes users eligible for [[tracking_the_value_of_wmemo_and_eligibility_for_airdrops | Wonderland airdrops]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This applies whether wMEMO is held on the Avalanche, Ethereum, or Fantom networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

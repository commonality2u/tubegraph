[[bridging_to_arbitrum | Bridging]] assets between different blockchain layers can sometimes involve significant waiting periods. For instance, using the [[bridging_to_arbitrum | official bridge]] to transfer assets back from [[bridging_to_arbitrum | Arbitrum]] (L2) to mainnet (L1) can take approximately eight days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

## Addressing Official Bridge Limitations

This extended waiting period for transfers from L2 to L1 can be mitigated by using [[bridging_to_arbitrum | Hop Exchange]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

## Benefits of Hop Exchange

When transferring assets, such as ETH, back from [[bridging_to_arbitrum | Arbitrum]] to the mainnet via [[bridging_to_arbitrum | Hop Exchange]], users incur a small fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. However, the primary advantage is that users can receive their funds almost immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. This provides a significantly faster alternative to the standard eight-day withdrawal period of the [[bridging_to_arbitrum | official bridge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

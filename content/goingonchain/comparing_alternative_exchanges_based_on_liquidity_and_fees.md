After Binance announced service restrictions for users in Singapore, a need arose to identify and compare alternative cryptocurrency exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This comparison focuses on key aspects such as liquidity, number of available coins, and trading fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>, using Binance as a benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

## Binance Service Restrictions

Effective September 27, 2021, Binance announced that users in Singapore would no longer have access to fiat deposit and withdrawal services, meaning DBS Remit would cease to function for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Additionally, spot trading and liquid swap services were discontinued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. Users were advised to exit all their assets by October 26, 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. While staking withdrawals after the deadline were uncertain, it was recommended to move coins to self-custody wallets like Trust Wallet or MetaMask for peace of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. Futures trading was reportedly unaffected as it's considered a different service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.

## Comparison of Alternative Exchanges

The primary criteria for comparing alternative exchanges are liquidity, the number of coins available, and fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Data for this comparison was sourced from CMC (CoinMarketCap) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

### Liquidity

Liquidity is crucial for tighter spreads in trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.
*   **4P** (likely referring to Huobi, based on later mentions) appears to have decent liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>.
*   **FTX** follows closely in terms of liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:80">[01:16:80]</a>.
*   For those interested in more unknown coins, **KuCoin** stands out, followed by **Huobi** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

### Fees

Trading fees are a significant factor, especially for active traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.
*   **FTX** offers the lowest fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:40">[01:29:40]</a>.
*   Holding FTX tokens provides an additional 3% discount on fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:80">[01:30:80]</a>.

## Personal Trading Flow Example

One suggested strategy involves a combination of exchanges to optimize for free withdrawals and earning interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:70">[01:37:70]</a>. This demonstrates a practical application of [[alternatives_to_binance_for_trading | alternatives to Binance for trading]].
1.  **DBS Remit to Gemini**: Funds are deposited into Gemini via DBS Remit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.
2.  **Convert to UST**: Funds are converted to UST (a [[using_stablecoins_and_other_exchanges_for_better_rates | stablecoin]]) on Gemini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.
3.  **Free Withdrawal to KuCoin**: Gemini offers 10 free withdrawals per month, which can be used to send UST to KuCoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.
4.  **Coin Purchase on KuCoin**: Desired coins are purchased on KuCoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.
5.  **Exit Strategy Options**:
    *   Sell coins and send to BSC to exit through an external platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
    *   Sell for UST and send the UST to Anchor Protocol to earn approximately 19.44% APY, treating it like a bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

6.  **Huobi Standby**: A Huobi account is kept as a standby option for peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions with Singapore dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

From: [[goingonchain]] <br/> 

wMEMO is the wrapped version of staked TIME, also known as MEMO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. It incorporates the price of TIME and all earned rebases (interest) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Wonderland is prioritizing its focus on TIME to wMEMO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## [[benefits_of_switching_to_wmemo | Benefits of Switching to wMEMO]]

Converting to wMEMO allows for a wider range of functionalities compared to holding MEMO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. [[using_wmemo_on_other_platforms | Using wMEMO on other platforms]] can help increase your yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

Key benefits and uses include:
*   **Abracadabra**: Use wMEMO as collateral to borrow MIM stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **SushiSwap**: Become a liquidity provider by pairing wMEMO with MIM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Pendle**: If you are interested in structured products, wMEMO can be broken down into OT (time value) and YT (yield value) using the Pendle service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. If you anticipate a drop in Wonderland's interest rates, you can sell your YT wMEMO and purchase OT to lock in the yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## [[how_to_convert_time_and_memo_to_wmemo | How to Convert TIME and MEMO to wMEMO]]

If you are already staking on Wonderland, you can find a "Wrap" function on the website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. By clicking "wrap," you can convert your MEMO to wMEMO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. To convert back from wMEMO to MEMO, click the arrow icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

It is important to note that the quantity of your wMEMO does not change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. However, the quantity of MEMO you can unwrap will increase over time because it includes the price and rebases (interest earned) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## [[tracking_the_value_of_wmemo_and_eligibility_for_airdrops | Tracking the Value of wMEMO and Eligibility for Airdrops]]

You can track the value of your wMEMO using a service called "The Bank" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. There is no need to constantly wrap and unwrap your tokens to check their value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

Holding wMEMO makes you eligible for Wonderland airdrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This eligibility extends to wMEMO held on Avalanche, Ethereum, and Fantom networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

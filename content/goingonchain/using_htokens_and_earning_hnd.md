When participating in [[earning_yield_on_hundred_finance | Hundred Finance]], it's important to understand the distinction between the supply APY and the staked APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## hTokens: Your Supply Receipt

When you supply a stablecoin or crypto asset to [[staking_and_yield_earning_on_hundred_finance | Hundred Finance]], you begin earning the supply APY on that asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. As a receipt for your supplied assets, you receive an "h token" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. For example, if you supply MIM, you will receive hMIM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

At this stage, you are only earning the supply APY on your deposited asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Earning HND Tokens

To earn the HND token APR, you must stake your hToken receipt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This process is referred to as "supply and stick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. For example, after supplying MIM to get hMIM, you would then choose to stake your hMIM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Staking Implications

It is critical to note that once your hTokens are staked, you will no longer be able to take a loan against your supplied assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. If your primary objective is to take a loan, you should only supply assets and take the loan, without staking your hTokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

If you choose to stake only a portion of your hTokens (e.g., half of your hMIM), your supply value and the available borrowing limit will drop proportionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Withdrawing HND Rewards

To collect the HND rewards you have earned from staking, navigate to the HND section on the platform and click the "collect" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The dashboard provides an overview of your supply APY and your staking APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Utilizing HND Tokens

Once you have HND tokens, you can further enhance your rewards by locking them up to receive [[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | veHND (Vote Escrowed HND)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This process involves [[locking_hnd_for_vehnd_rewards | locking HND for veHND Rewards]] by choosing a lockup period, with a maximum of 4 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The amount of [[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | veHND]] received is directly proportional to the amount of HND locked and the duration of the lockup (e.g., 100 HND locked for 4 years yields 100 [[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | veHND]]; 2 years yields 50 [[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | veHND]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

With [[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | veHND]], you can:
*   [[boosting_rewards_with_vehnd_voting | Vote]] to direct HND rewards to specific pools, influencing their average APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   [[boosting_rewards_with_vehnd_voting | Boost your own rewards]] on staked assets by up to 2.5 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

Hundred Finance provides a calculator to determine the [[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | veHND]] needed for maximum boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Voting and boosting can only be performed every 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Your boosted APR will be reflected in the next epoch, the end of which is displayed on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

Convex Finance is a significant protocol within the [[Curve and its algorithm | Curve]] ecosystem, acting as the largest holder of veCRV (Vote-Escrowed CRV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. Its primary function is to allow [[Curve and its algorithm | CRV]] token holders to receive boosted rewards within [[Curve and its algorithm | Curve]] pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

## How Convex Finance Works

Convex Finance optimizes the process of earning [[Curve and its algorithm | CRV]] rewards and participating in [[Curve and its algorithm | Curve]] governance:
*   **CRV to cvxCRV Conversion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>: Users can convert their [[Curve and its algorithm | CRV]] tokens into cvxCRV. This conversion is a one-way process; users cannot convert cvxCRV back to [[Curve and its algorithm | CRV]] directly through Convex, only via a secondary market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.
*   **Staking cvxCRV for Rewards** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>: Once converted, cvxCRV can be staked to earn [[Curve and its algorithm | CRV]] rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>. Convex achieves this by pooling users' [[Curve and its algorithm | CRV]], locking it as veCRV, and using it to vote for gauges that direct [[Curve and its algorithm | CRV]] emissions to specific pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. The rewards generated are then shared with the cvxCRV stakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.
*   **vlCVX for Governance and Rewards** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>: In addition to cvxCRV, users can lock their CVX tokens for 16 weeks to receive vlCVX (Vote-Locked CVX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. Holding vlCVX provides more rewards and allows participation in Convex's governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

## Role in the [[partnerships_and_strategies_in_the_curve_ecosystem | Curve War]]

Convex Finance plays a central role in the phenomenon known as the "[[partnerships_and_strategies_in_the_curve_ecosystem | Curve War]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. Protocols seeking to increase liquidity and [[Curve and its algorithm | CRV]] rewards for their specific pools on [[Curve and its algorithm | Curve]] often find it more efficient to "bribe" vlCVX holders rather than acquiring and locking large amounts of [[Curve and its algorithm | CRV]] themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

Platforms like Votium facilitate this process, allowing other protocols to offer bribes to vlCVX users in exchange for their votes to direct [[Curve and its algorithm | CRV]] emissions to their respective pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. For instance, FLUX and UST have been observed paying significant amounts per vlCVX to influence votes for their pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

## Strategic Partnerships and Influence

Convex's large holding of veCRV makes it a powerful entity in the [[Curve and its algorithm | Curve]] ecosystem. Protocols like Frax and Terra (TFL) are among the largest protocol holders of CVX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a> and provide substantial volume incentives to vlCVX holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

These strategic alliances, including partnerships with Frax, Terra, Retracted, Badger, Olympus, and Token Reader, enable a collective effort to influence CVX governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. For example, in the context of the "4pool" initiative (a partnership between UST, FLUX, USDC, and USDT aiming to replace DAI in the dominant stablecoin pool) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>, these partners can collectively push a significant amount of CVX governance towards the 4pool, aiming to make it the most liquid stablecoin pool across chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. This demonstrates how Convex centralizes influence over [[Curve and its algorithm | Curve]]'s liquidity direction.

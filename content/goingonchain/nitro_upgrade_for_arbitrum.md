Arbitrum, a major Layer 2 (L2) solution, introduced the [[introduction_to_arbitrum_nitro_upgrade | Nitro]] upgrade as a solution to handle increased network traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This upgrade was designed to allow for more transactions and user activity on the chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Background: The Arbitrum Odyssey Program

Prior to the [[introduction_to_arbitrum_nitro_upgrade | Nitro]] upgrade, Arbitrum initiated a program called [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This program involved several tasks, such as [[bridging_to_arbitrum | bridging]] assets over to Arbitrum, which would reward users with an [[nft_incentives_from_bridging_on_arbitrum | NFT]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It was intended to be an eight-week program with new tasks released weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### Why Nitro Was Needed

The [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] program was paused because of an overwhelming surge in traffic, which caused gas prices to spike significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This increase in activity was largely driven by [[speculation_on_arbitrum_token_eligibility | speculation]] regarding a potential [[arbitrum_airdrop_speculation | airdrop]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. To address these scalability issues, [[introduction_to_arbitrum_nitro_upgrade | Nitro]] was introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Launch and Aftermath

[[introduction_to_arbitrum_nitro_upgrade | Nitro]] officially went live on August 31st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. However, even after the upgrade, the [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] program did not resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### Subsequent Programs

While [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] did not return, another program emerged, focusing on quests to earn roles within the Arbitrum [[completing_tasks_for_discord_roles_in_arbitrum | Discord]] server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Despite the organizers clarifying that this program only grants [[completing_tasks_for_discord_roles_in_arbitrum | Discord]] roles and nothing more, approximately 50,000 people have participated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The cost to complete these tasks is around 0.02 ETH plus gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

Completing all tasks grants access to various roles within the Arbitrum [[completing_tasks_for_discord_roles_in_arbitrum | Discord]] server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Users can connect their wallet, [[completing_tasks_for_discord_roles_in_arbitrum | Discord]], and Twitter accounts via guild.xyz/Arbitrum to participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

Some tasks require purchasing small amounts of tokens (e.g., 0.01 JMX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. These tokens are typically available on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap or SushiSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. For safety, it's recommended to find token contract addresses via an explorer and then paste them into the DEX rather than directly searching by name to avoid scam tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

If a user wishes to complete tasks related to the concluded [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] program, they would need to purchase the corresponding [[nft_incentives_from_bridging_on_arbitrum | NFT]] from a secondary marketplace like TofuNFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

The year 2022 was described as "down" for the crypto market, with portfolios being down around 80% to 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. It was characterized by a multitude of market failures, scams, and a significant shift in the broader economic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Timeline of Key Events

*   **January - February:** The year began with the Wonderland rug pull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, which significantly impacted some investors who were drawn into the "Frog Nation" narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **March:** The Federal Reserve began raising interest rates, moving from 0.25% to 4.375% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This marked the end of the "money printers," leading to a withdrawal of risk capital and a liquidity crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **May:** The collapse of [[significant_cryptocurrency_failures_in_2022_such_as_luna_and_ftx | Luna]] occurred, which was a particularly hard hit for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This event initiated a "House of Cards" chain reaction throughout the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **June:** The repercussions continued with Celsius halting withdrawals, followed by the liquidation of Three Arrows Capital (3AC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. At one point, Ethereum (ETH) dropped below $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **September:** A notable positive event was "The Merge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Late 2022:** The year concluded with the [[significant_cryptocurrency_failures_in_2022_such_as_luna_and_ftx | FTX]] Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing and revelations about Sam Bankman-Fried (SPF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. At the time of this review, SPF was out on bail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Overall:** Beyond major events, 2022 was plagued by numerous scams and instances of fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Personal Investment Approach and Learnings

Despite the challenging environment, some continued to invest, demonstrating their belief in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This included continuing to [[dca_strategy_during_bear_market | DCA (Dollar-Cost Average)]] into "blue chip" cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### [[key_takeaways_and_lessons_learned_in_crypto_investing | Key Takeaways and Lessons Learned]]

1.  **Understanding Yield Origin:** A crucial lesson was the importance of truly understanding where yield is generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The saying, "If I do not understand the yield, where the yield is coming from, I am the yield," became apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Past experiences with Wonderland and Terra Luna highlighted a misconception of understanding yield sources during the bull market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
    *   **Action:** To make more informed decisions, individuals are now picking up skills like Python and SQL to extract and understand on-chain data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Tools like Nansen can be leveraged to analyze on-chain actions, which provides a deeper understanding than merely following thought leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
2.  **Self-Custody:** The adage "Not your keys, not your coins" proved critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Cases like Celsius and [[significant_cryptocurrency_failures_in_2022_such_as_luna_and_ftx | FTX]] underscored the importance of self-custody for assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   **Action:** While centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance and Crypto.com are still used for on-ramping and off-ramping, large sums of assets are quickly moved to personal wallets for self-custody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
    *   **Impact on DeFi:** The increased concern regarding trust in CEXs is seen as building a stronger use case for Decentralized Finance (DeFi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Other Observations

*   **Career Shift:** Some individuals joined Web3 companies, gaining insight into the inner workings of crypto and building networks through travel opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Social Media:** Social media can be a valuable tool for connecting, but it also contains unhelpful comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This has led to a re-evaluation of online access and managing one's digital footprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

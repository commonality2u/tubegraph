The concept of blockchain is fundamental to how [[introduction_to_cryptocurrencies | cryptocurrencies]] operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Blockchain as a Public Database

You can visualize blockchain as a public database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This database requires "validators" to continuously check it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Validation Process

By validating the blockchain, it is ensured that all transactions within the network are real and legitimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Blockchain Algorithms: Proof of Work vs. Proof of Stake

Within blockchain, there are two primary algorithms used for validation: Proof of Work and Proof of Stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Proof of Work (PoW)

*   Proof of Work is the algorithm used by networks like Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   When people engage in "Bitcoin mining," they purchase specialized hardware and consume significant energy to validate transactions on the Bitcoin network using Proof of Work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Proof of Stake (PoS)

*   Proof of Stake is increasingly favored by protocols because it eliminates the need for dedicated hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, unlike Proof of Work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   On a Proof of Stake network, taking control does not depend on having a more powerful computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Instead, an entity would need to own 51% of the network's cryptocurrency to exert control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Coins vs. Tokens

When discussing [[introduction_to_cryptocurrencies | cryptocurrencies]], the terms "coins" and "tokens" refer to different operational structures on a blockchain:
*   **Coins** are [[introduction_to_cryptocurrencies | cryptocurrencies]] that operate on their own independent blockchain, such as Bitcoin running on the Bitcoin network or Ethereum on the Ethereum network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Tokens** are [[introduction_to_cryptocurrencies | cryptocurrencies]] that do not run on their own chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Examples include USDC and DAI, which operate on top of existing chains like the Ethereum chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

Having understood the basics of how blockchain underpins [[introduction_to_cryptocurrencies | cryptocurrencies]], the next step involves exploring different ways to [[investing_in_cryptocurrency | invest in cryptocurrency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

DC DAO's native token is called EGS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Users can mint EGS tokens at a discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Tokenomics

The distribution of the EGS token offering is structured as follows:
*   **Public Allocation**: 80% of the offering is directed towards the NFT auction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Team Allocation**: 10% is reserved for the DC DAO team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. The team's tokens are subject to a vesting period of six months, with a two-month cliff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. This vesting period is noted as potentially being short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Initial Liquidity**: 10% is allocated for the initial liquidity supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

When users mint EGS tokens, DC DAO is able to build up its treasury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The DAO's objective is to become a "treasury of treasuries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, accumulating assets such as wMEMO, OHM, and MIN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Staking EGS Tokens

Users have the option to [[staking_on_snowbank | stake]] their EGS tokens to earn interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. In its initial phase, DC DAO aims for a 50,000% APY for staked EGS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### NFT Benefits for Staking and Bonding

DC DAO employs an Initial NFT Offering (INO) where users purchase NFTs to gain an allocation of EGS tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. These NFTs are sold via auction and are categorized into three tiers: God, Dante, and Damning God <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Owning certain NFT tiers provides benefits for EGS token holders:
*   **Staking Boost**: A Dante tier NFT offers a 2.5% boost in staking rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Bonding Boost**: The Dante tier also provides a 5% bonding boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Additional Allocation**: Certain NFT levels, such as a Bronze Dante, can provide an additional 25% allocation of EGS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Revenue Model for APY Sustainability

DC DAO intends to build a decentralized exchange (DEX) that will hold assets from protocols like wMEMO, OHM, Hector, and Exodia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This DEX will allow users to swap tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Users can swap EGS tokens for other assets after rebases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The swap fees generated on this DEX will contribute to the treasury as revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This revenue is expected to help fund the APY provided to EGS stakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

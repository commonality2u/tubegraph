[[gains_network_overview | Gains Network]] operates a synthetic exchange called Gains Trade for leveraged traders on the Polygon chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The platform ensures fair spot prices through a custom decentralized oracle network (DON) built with Chainlink, addressing issues like "scam weeks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## [[role_of_gns_tokens_in_gains_network | GNS Token]]omics

The [[gains_network_overview | Gains Network]] platform uses the [[role_of_gns_tokens_in_gains_network | GNS token]] to build its liquidity and manage trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Trades on Gains Trade are synthetic, meaning there is no real underlying asset being bought or sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The platform is supported by two key pools: the [[role_of_gns_tokens_in_gains_network | GNS]] DAI pool, which acts as liquidity, and the trading vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### Liquidity and Trading Vault Mechanism
When a user enters a trade, they deposit DAI into the trading vault, and profits or losses are drawn from this vault upon exiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The DAI trading vault is designed to maintain a 110% over-collateralized ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

- If the trading vault balance exceeds 110%, the excess DAI is used to buy [[role_of_gns_tokens_in_gains_network | GNS]] from the liquidity pool, and that [[role_of_gns_tokens_in_gains_network | GNS]] is then burned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
- If the trading vault balance falls below 100%, [[role_of_gns_tokens_in_gains_network | GNS]] is minted and sold for DAI to top up the trading vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

This mechanism creates buying pressure on the [[role_of_gns_tokens_in_gains_network | GNS token]] when more traders are losing, contributing to its deflationary nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Historically, data indicates that more traders have lost than won on the platform, leading to [[role_of_gns_tokens_in_gains_network | GNS]] burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Token Supply and Deflation
The platform launched in January 2021 on the Ethereum Mainnet, but due to high gas fees, it transitioned to the Polygon chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. During this transition, a 1:1000 token split occurred, meaning 1,000 [[role_of_gns_tokens_in_gains_network | GNS]] tokens were issued for every gphantom token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

-   **Current Supply:** 38.5 million [[role_of_gns_tokens_in_gains_network | GNS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
-   **Maximum Supply:** 100 million [[role_of_gns_tokens_in_gains_network | GNS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
-   The [[role_of_gns_tokens_in_gains_network | GNS]] token is built to be deflationary; as more traders lose, more [[role_of_gns_tokens_in_gains_network | GNS]] tokens are burned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
-   The current inflation rate for [[role_of_gns_tokens_in_gains_network | GNS]] is negative 25%, indicating a deflationary state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## Future Roadmap
The [[gains_network_overview | Gains Network]] roadmap includes:
-   Adding more crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
-   Implementing [[role_of_gns_tokens_in_gains_network | GNS]] single staking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
-   Multi-chain expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
-   Plans to enter the decentralized casino space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

Despite its market capitalization being relatively small compared to leaders like dYdX, [[gains_network_overview | Gains Network]] aims to capture market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. A potential concern is that most liquidity for decentralized exchanges remains on the Ethereum Mainnet, posing a challenge for platforms built on Polygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. However, a multi-chain strategy could attract more liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

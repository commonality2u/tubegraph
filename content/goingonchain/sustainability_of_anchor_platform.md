The high interest rate offered on the Anchor platform, previously at 19.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, is undergoing changes to ensure the platform's long-term sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Dynamic Interest Rate Mechanism

A new vote has been passed to make the [[interest_rates_on_anchor_protocol | earn rate]] (the interest paid to depositors) dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This adjustment is based on a specific formula tied to the yield reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>:
*   If the yield reserve increases by 5%, the interest rate will increase by 1.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   If the yield reserve drops by 5%, the interest rate will decrease by 1.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

These adjustments are scheduled to take place monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Current Yield Reserve Trend

Over the past 30 days, the yield reserve has shown a downward trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This is primarily due to an imbalance where more users are depositing funds than borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Strategies to Improve Sustainability

To address the imbalance and improve the sustainability gap, Anchor plans to:
*   **Add more [[role_of_collateral_in_anchor_protocol | collateral]]**: The goal is to onboard more collateral assets to encourage an increase in borrowing activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
    *   Recently, [[AVAX_Collateral_and_Borrowing_on_Anchor | AVAX]] was added as collateral, enabling AVAX users to borrow UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
    *   It is important to note that adding new collateral options is a time-consuming process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

It is anticipated that the [[interest_rates_on_anchor_protocol | interest rate]] on Anchor will likely decrease in the coming months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. However, even with a potential decrease of 1.5% per month, the rate is expected to remain significantly higher than traditional local bank offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Users are advised to take a wait-and-see approach while also exploring other stablecoin yield opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

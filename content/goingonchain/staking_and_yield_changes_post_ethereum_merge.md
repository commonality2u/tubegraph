The [[The Merge on Ethereum | Merge]] marks a significant transition for [[ethereum_merge_and_its_implications | Ethereum]] from a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a full Proof of Stake (PoS) system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. While the [[The Merge on Ethereum | Merge]] will not directly lower [[impact_of_ethereum_merge_on_gas_fees | gas fees]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, it has profound implications for staking and the yield earned by participants.

## Current Staking (Pre-Merge)

The [[ethereum_merge_and_its_implications | Ethereum]] Proof of Stake system, known as the Beacon Chain, has been operational since December 1, 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Platforms like Binance, KuCoin, and Lido allow users to stake [[ethereum_merge_and_its_implications | ETH]] 2.0 on the Beacon Chain, even though it is not yet producing blocks for the mainnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Currently, the typical Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for staking [[ethereum_merge_and_its_implications | ETH]] is between 3% to 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. As of the discussion, approximately 10 million [[ethereum_merge_and_its_implications | ETH]] are already staked and locked on the Beacon Chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

## Expected Yield Changes Post-Merge

A significant change anticipated post-[[The Merge on Ethereum | Merge]] is a substantial increase in staking yield, projected to be between 50% to 100% higher than current rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. This could result in expected yields around 10% for [[ethereum_merge_and_its_implications | ETH]] staking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

The reasons for this increase include:
*   **Lower Security Cost:** Moving to Proof of Stake significantly reduces the cost of securing the network, as it eliminates the need for expensive mining rigs and high energy consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. This allows more individuals to participate as validators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Rewards to Stakers:** Post-[[The Merge on Ethereum | Merge]], rewards that were previously distributed to miners in the PoW system will instead be given to stakers (validators) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

## Impact on [[ethereum_merge_and_its_implications | ETH]] Supply (Deflationary Pressure)

The [[The Merge on Ethereum | Merge]] combined with the EIP-1559 upgrade, which burns a portion of transaction base fees, is expected to make [[ethereum_merge_and_its_implications | ETH]] deflationary in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
*   **Issuance Reduction:** The daily issuance of new [[ethereum_merge_and_its_implications | ETH]] is expected to drop by approximately 90% after the [[The Merge on Ethereum | Merge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. For example, daily issuance could fall from about 13,500 [[ethereum_merge_and_its_implications | ETH]] (around 4.3% of total supply) to 0.3-0.4% after the switch to Proof of Stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **EIP-1559 Burn Mechanism:** EIP-1559, implemented in August 2021, changed the fee mechanism to burn the base fee of transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:49]</a>. During periods of high network activity, such as the peak of NFT hype, the burning of base fees led to deflation, with more [[ethereum_merge_and_its_implications | ETH]] being burned than produced daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This combined effect of reduced issuance and burning contributes to a potential decrease in the overall supply of [[ethereum_merge_and_its_implications | ETH]] in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

## How to Stake Post-[[The Merge on Ethereum | Merge]] (and Pre-Merge)

To participate in staking, one can become a validator by holding 32 [[ethereum_merge_and_its_implications | ETH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. For those with less than 32 [[ethereum_merge_and_its_implications | ETH]], pooling options are available:
*   **Lido:** Allows staking with as little as 0.1 [[ethereum_merge_and_its_implications | ETH]], currently offering around 3.9% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. It provides liquid staking tokens (e.g., stETH) that can be used in other [[Real Yield in DeFi | DeFi]] protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
*   **Rocket Pool:** Another pooling option where users can contribute their [[ethereum_merge_and_its_implications | ETH]] and typically earn around 4% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

These pooling options provide a receipt token (e.g., r[[ethereum_merge_and_its_implications | ETH]] for Rocket Pool) that represents the staked [[ethereum_merge_and_its_implications | ETH]] and can be used for other purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

## Withdrawal of Staked [[ethereum_merge_and_its_implications | ETH]]

A key concern is the unlocking of the 10 million [[ethereum_merge_and_its_implications | ETH]] currently staked on the Beacon Chain once withdrawals are enabled post-[[The Merge on Ethereum | Merge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **No Immediate Unlocking:** Withdrawals will not be enabled immediately after the [[The Merge on Ethereum | Merge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. They are planned to be released during a subsequent hard fork, which could take 6 to 8 months after the [[The Merge on Ethereum | Merge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
*   **Built-in Queue System:** Even when withdrawals are enabled, a built-in queue system will limit the amount of [[ethereum_merge_and_its_implications | ETH]] that can be released daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. A maximum of 1,125 validators (or roughly 36,000 [[ethereum_merge_and_its_implications | ETH]]) can be released per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. This mechanism is designed to prevent a sudden mass sell-off of [[ethereum_merge_and_its_implications | ETH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Incentive to Hold:** With the anticipated 10% staking yield post-[[The Merge on Ethereum | Merge]], many stakers may choose to continue holding and restaking their [[ethereum_merge_and_its_implications | ETH]] rather than selling it, further mitigating potential selling pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

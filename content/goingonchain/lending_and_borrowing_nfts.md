[[introduction_to_cryptocurrency_lending_platforms | BenDAO]] is a platform focused on [[peer_to_peer_lending_and_borrowing | lending and borrowing]] Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. It has recently gained attention in the NFT market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Key Features of BenDAO

### Borrowing Against NFTs
Users can deposit their NFTs and [[borrowing_against_crypto_assets | borrow]] Ethereum (ETH) against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. As of a recent period, the interest rate for borrowing ETH with an NFT was significantly high, at minus 92% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This extreme rate is attributed to an insufficient supply of deposits on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. BenDAO selectively accepts only seven specific "blue-chip" NFTs for collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Buying NFTs at a Discount
The platform allows users to purchase NFTs at a discount through a "down payment" system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. For instance, a Mayc (Mutant Ape Yacht Club) NFT with a full price of 14.6 ETH could be acquired for 11.05 ETH, with the remaining amount being borrowed from the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The borrowed amount can be repaid at any time, subject to interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Supplying ETH for Interest
Users can supply ETH to the platform to earn a high Annual Percentage Rate (APR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Currently, the earnings are 72% in ETH plus additional platform token rewards, totaling 77% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The ETH utilization rate on the platform is approximately 95% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Bidding on Liquidating NFTs
BenDAO provides an option to bid on NFTs that are in the process of liquidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. An example given is a MAYC NFT where the owner borrowed 10.82 ETH, and the floor price has reached 12.32 ETH, triggering a liquidation state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The owner has 48 hours to redeem their NFT; otherwise, it will be sold to the highest bidder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Bids must always be greater than the current highest bid price plus an additional 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Challenges and Considerations
While BenDAO aims to provide [[instant_liquidity_for_nft_buyers_and_sellers | liquidity for NFT holders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, it faces certain challenges:
*   **High Utilization Rate:** The high utilization rate means that users who have lent ETH may not be able to withdraw their funds easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Locked Funds for Bidders:** When participating in bids for liquidating NFTs, bidders must lock up their ETH for 48 hours, which introduces a risk for the bidder and can deter participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

It is noted that purchasing Ape NFTs from the platform might not always be the best deal due to these factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The platform's success hinges on its ability to address these underlying problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

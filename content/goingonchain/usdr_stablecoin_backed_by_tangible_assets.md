USDR is an over-collateralized stablecoin developed by Tangible, a marketplace that converts real-world assets into NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

## Collateralization and Backing
USDR is backed by a diversified mix of assets, including:
*   Real estate assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>
*   Tangible tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>
*   DAI (a different stablecoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>
*   Protocol-owned liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>

## Preventing a Death Spiral
Learning from past incidents involving other stablecoins like UST (TerraUSD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>, Tangible implements safeguards to prevent USDR from falling into a "death spiral" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. Their strategy ensures that at least 88% of the backing assets are not their native Tangible tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. Only when this 88% threshold of other assets is met is it possible to use Tangible's native tokens to mint USDR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

## Yield on USDR
Currently, USDR offers a yield of 4.25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. However, Tangible considers this yield to be low and plans to subsidize it to push the yield to approximately six to nine percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

## Role of Tangible Tokens
Tangible tokens are integral to the ecosystem, as they can be used for minting USDR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. They also generate revenue from product sales on the Tangible platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. The platform uses a "ve-concept" (vote-escrow) for Tangible tokens, where staking and locking them turns them into an NFT, with longer lock-up periods resulting in higher rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. If users wish to exit, they can sell their locked NFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

The USDR stablecoin is backed by real estate and other assets that are physically available through the Tangible marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:14">[01:38:14]</a>.

## How USDR is Collateralized
USDR is an over-collateralized [[types_of_stablecoins | stablecoin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:26">[01:44:26]</a>. Its backing includes a mix of assets:
*   Real estate assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:03">[01:49:03]</a>
*   Tangible tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:03">[01:50:03]</a>
*   DAI (a [[dollar_stablecoin_and_farming_opportunities | dollar stablecoin]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:53">[01:50:53]</a>
*   Protocol-owned liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:83">[01:51:83]</a>

## Preventing a "Death Spiral"
Learning from previous incidents, Tangible aims to prevent USDR from entering a "death spiral" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:26">[01:54:26]</a>. To achieve this, at least 88% of the backing must consist of other assets before their native token can be used to mint USDR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:27">[02:00:27]</a>.

## USDR Yield
Currently, USDR offers a yield of 4.25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:48">[02:10:48]</a>. However, this is considered low, so Tangible plans to subsidize it, aiming to push the yield to approximately six to nine percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:68">[02:15:68]</a>.

## Role of Tangible Tokens
Tangible tokens, which are part of the collateral mix for USDR, can also be used for minting USDR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

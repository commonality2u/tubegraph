Tangible is a [[marketplace_converting_real_world_assets_to_nfts | marketplace that converts real-world assets into NFTs]] (Non-Fungible Tokens) through [[methods_for_buying_and_selling_cryptocurrency | cryptocurrency adoption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This platform allows users to purchase tangible items like gold bars, silver, and watches using USDC (USD Coin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## How Tangible Works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>

When a purchase is made on Tangible, an NFT (tNFT) is minted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The physical item is stored in a vault, which incurs a storage fee, especially for high-value items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Users have the option to take delivery of their items at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>

For items acquired from another seller, a platform fee of 2.5% is charged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This fee is distributed as follows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>:
*   33.33% is used to buy and burn Tangible tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   66.66% goes to Tangible stakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Types of Tangible Assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>

### Physical Goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>

Tangible allows for the purchase of physical items like gold bars, silver, and watches using USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. These high-value items are stocked in a vault and are subject to storage fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Real Estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>

Tangible also offers real estate, where users can purchase fractions of a property or acquire all fractions to own the entire real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The focus for real estate assets is on capital appreciation and rental yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

For example, a property might have a rent of $494 per month, with a net yield of approximately 15.17%, inclusive of capital appreciation and rental yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Yield calculations must account for management and other fees, as Tangible handles the legal, maintenance, and paperwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

There is a minimum fraction required for purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Rental yield begins only after all property fractions have been sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## USDR Stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>

Tangible is involved in backing the [[usdr_stablecoin_backed_by_tangible_assets | USDR stablecoin]] using its physically available real estate assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. USDR is an over-collateralized stablecoin backed by a mix of real estate assets, Tangible tokens, DAI, and protocol-owned liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

Learning from the UST incident, Tangible ensures that USDR will not enter a "death spiral" by maintaining at least 88% backing from other assets before allowing its native token to be used for minting USDR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

Currently, USDR offers a yield of 4.25%, but Tangible plans to subsidize this to push the yield to approximately 6% to 9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Tangible Token Usage and Rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>

Tangible tokens are used for minting USDR and generate revenue from product sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The platform implements a ve-concept for Tangible tokens, where staking and locking them converts them into an NFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The longer the tokens are locked, the higher the rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Should users wish to exit, they can sell their tokenized NFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. More information can be found via Tangible DAO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

The year 2022 was described as "down back" for many in the crypto space, with one investor's portfolio seeing a decline of 18% to 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The period was marked by significant challenges and events that shaped key lessons for [[investing_in_cryptocurrency | crypto investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Recap of the 2022 Crypto Market Downturn
The year began with significant disruptions and continued market contractions:
*   **January-February:** The Wonderland rug pull occurred, impacting investors who were drawn into the "frog nation" narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **March:** The Federal Reserve began raising interest rates, moving from 0.25% to 4.375% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This action halted the "money printers," led to a withdrawal of risk capital, and initiated a liquidity crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This was a significant factor in the [[2022_crypto_market_downturn_and_key_events | 2022 crypto market downturn and key events]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **May:** The "big one" arrived with the fall of Luna, which initiated a "House of Cards" chain reaction throughout the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This was a critical event in the [[2022_crypto_market_downturn_and_key_events | 2022 crypto market downturn and key events]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **June:** Celsius halted withdrawals, Three Arrows Capital (3AC) faced liquidation, and Ethereum's price briefly dropped below $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. These incidents were also part of the [[2022_crypto_market_downturn_and_key_events | 2022 crypto market downturn and key events]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **September:** The Merge successfully took place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Late 2022:** FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and its founder, SPF, was released on bail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This event also contributed to the severity of the [[2022_crypto_market_downturn_and_key_events | 2022 crypto market downturn and key events]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

Beyond macroeconomic factors, 2022 also saw a significant increase in scams and fraud within the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Despite the challenges, those who remain in the space demonstrate a strong belief in crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Personal Investment Approach and Learnings
During this turbulent period, one investor continued to [[cryptocurrency_investment_approach | Dollar-Cost Average (DCA)]] into "blue chip" crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Additionally, joining a Web3 company provided an opportunity to understand the "inner workings of crypto" and expand professional networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Key Takeaways from 2022 Crypto Investing

### 1. Understanding the Source of Yield
A crucial lesson learned is: "If I do not understand the yield, where the yield is coming from, I am the yield" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. During the bull market, it was easier to feel confident about yield sources, but experiences with Wonderland and Terra Luna revealed a lack of true understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

To make more informed decisions, skills like Python and SQL are being acquired to extract and analyze on-chain data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. While following thought leaders is helpful, observing their on-chain actions provides deeper insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Tools like Nansen Scan can be leveraged to make better decisions by analyzing on-chain activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This directly impacts [[managing_risk_with_crypto_investments | managing risk with crypto investments]] and [[managing_crypto_investments_during_rapid_market_changes | managing crypto investments during rapid market changes]].

### 2. The Importance of Self-Custody: "Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins"
The collapses of centralized exchanges and platforms like Celsius and FTX underscore the critical importance of self-custody of crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. While centralized exchanges (CEX) like Binance and Crypto.com are still used for on/off-ramping, large sums of assets are not kept on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Instead, assets are quickly moved to personal wallets once acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The concerns over trust in CEXs may also build a stronger case for decentralized finance (DeFi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This highlights the [[importance_of_storing_crypto_assets_safely | importance of storing crypto assets safely]].

### 3. Managing Digital Footprint and Online Interactions
A personal reflection from the year involves managing one's digital footprint and re-evaluating online access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. While social media can facilitate connections, it also exposes users to unhelpful comments and self-doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Instead of deleting accounts, a re-evaluation of online engagement is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

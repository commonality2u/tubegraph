From: [[goingonchain]] <br/> 

The second week of the [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey program]] was temporarily paused due to unforeseen network congestion and high transaction fees on the [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum]] network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Pause of Arbitrum Odyssey Week 2

The main reason for the pause was a surge in gas fees, with some users reportedly paying around $21 for a single swap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This was considered "very uncool" for an L2 (Layer 2) solution, which is intended to offer cheaper gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

The program will restart after the launch of [[nitro_upgrade_for_arbitrum | Nitro]], which is described as an "accelerated version" of [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum]] designed to reduce heavy network load and subsequently lower gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Previous Week's NFT Collection

Before the planned Week 2 activities, participants who had completed [[bridging_to_arbitrum | bridging to Arbitrum]] in Week 1 were able to collect their NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Those who used Hop for bridging could check their Discord for instructions on collecting a bonus NFT, as Hop had the highest volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Hop also announced winners for a small NFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Protocols for Arbitrum Odyssey Week 2

For the second week of the [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey program]], two protocols were slated for tasks: Yield and GMX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Yield Protocol

Yield is a fixed-rate borrowing platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Users can provide collateral to borrow stablecoins like USDC or DAI at a fixed interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. If loans are not repaid by the maturity date (e.g., September 30, 2022, for a specific example), the interest rate converts to a variable rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Users can also lend assets, with the ability to withdraw early, though this may incur slippage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

To qualify for tasks on Yield, participants needed to complete one of three options with a minimum sum of $50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>:
*   Lend $50 of an asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>
*   Provide $50 in LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>
*   Borrow $100 or more of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>

The easiest way to qualify was by lending $50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### GMX

GMX is a perpetual trading platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, popular on crypto Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. It allows users to long or short positions and swap tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

To qualify for tasks on GMX, participants needed to complete three actions with a minimum sum of $10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>:
1.  Open a leverage trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>
2.  Perform a token swap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>
3.  Mint GLP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>

GLP is a liquidity provider token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. When GLP is purchased, it is automatically staked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. At the time, the APR for GLP was approximately 16.87%, with an additional 10% in ETH as part of the reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This ETH reward made it a popular method for accumulating ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Future of Arbitrum Odyssey

The [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey program]] will only resume after the [[introduction_to_arbitrum_nitro_upgrade | Nitro upgrade for Arbitrum]] is released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Further updates on the program's continuation and potential [[arbitrum_airdrop_speculation | airdrops]] are expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

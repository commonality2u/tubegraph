From: [[goingonchain]] <br/> 

The [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] campaign was paused due to excessive network congestion, particularly during what was intended to be Week 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. A primary reason for this pause was a significant surge in gas fees, with some swap transactions costing around $21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This high fee was notable given that Layer 2 solutions like [[comparisons_between_arbitrum_and_optimism | Arbitrum]] are designed to offer cheaper transaction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

The campaign is set to resume following the launch of [[arbitrum_nitro_and_its_potential_benefits | Arbitrum Nitro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. [[arbitrum_nitro_and_its_potential_benefits | Nitro]] is described as an accelerated version of [[comparisons_between_arbitrum_and_optimism | Arbitrum]], intended to alleviate heavy network loads and consequently reduce gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Pre-Week 2 Reminders and Rewards

Before diving into the planned Week 2 activities, there are a few important points for participants who have already bridged assets to [[comparisons_between_arbitrum_and_optimism | Arbitrum]]:

*   **NFT Collection**: If you have already bridged over to [[comparisons_between_arbitrum_and_optimism | Arbitrum]], you can now collect your [[collecting_nfts_and_airdrops_in_arbitrum_odyssey | NFT]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Protocols and Tasks for the Supposed Week 2

The planned Week 2 of the [[arbitrum_odyssey_campaign_overview | Arbitrum Odyssey]] was set to involve two protocols: Yield and GMX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Yield Protocol

Yield is a fixed-rate borrowing platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

*   **Borrowing**: Users can deposit collateral and borrow stablecoins like USDC or DAI at a fixed interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. As of the time of the recording, the fixed rate was 0% with a maturity date of September 30, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Failing to repay on time would convert the interest to a variable rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Lending**: Users can also lend assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. For example, lending 50 USDC with a September maturity allows withdrawal anytime, though early withdrawal might incur slippage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

To qualify for the [[arbitrum_odyssey_campaign_overview | Arbitrum Odyssey]] tasks on Yield, participants needed to complete one of three actions, with a minimum sum of $50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>:

*   Lend $50 or more of an asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   Provide $50 or more in liquidity (LP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   Borrow $100 or more in assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

The easiest way to qualify was to simply lend $50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### GMX Protocol

GMX is a perpetual trading platform that is highly discussed on Crypto Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. It allows users to long, short, and swap tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

To qualify for the [[arbitrum_odyssey_campaign_overview | Arbitrum Odyssey]] tasks on GMX, participants needed to complete three actions with a minimum sum of $10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>:

*   Open a leverage trade (long or short) using various assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   Perform a token swap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   Mint GLP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

**Minting GLP**: GLP is a liquidity provider token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. When GLP is purchased, it is automatically staked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. At the time of recording, the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for GLP was 16.87% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Notably, 10% of the rewards were given out in ETH, making it an attractive option for those looking to accumulate ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## Conclusion of the Pause

The [[arbitrum_odyssey_campaign_overview | Arbitrum Odyssey]] remains paused and will only resume after [[arbitrum_nitro_and_its_potential_benefits | Nitro]] is released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This phased approach aims to ensure a smoother experience for participants, allowing them to continue collecting [[collecting_nfts_and_airdrops_in_arbitrum_odyssey | NFTs]] and potentially qualify for future [[speculations_about_an_arbitrum_airdrop | airdrops]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

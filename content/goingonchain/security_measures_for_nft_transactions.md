[[importance_of_cryptocurrency_security | Digital security]] in the realm of [[NFT and tokenization | NFT]] transactions is crucial, particularly due to the prevalence of phishing attacks and contract vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Recent OpenC Phishing Attack

A notable incident involved a phishing attack on OpenC, which resulted in 17 users inadvertently falling victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The funds stolen by the hacker were reportedly sent to Tornado Cash, a service described as a "washing machine" that renders deposited crypto untraceable upon withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The situation is currently under investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

The attack originated after OpenC released a new smart contract, asking users to migrate their listings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This contract was intended to upgrade and delete inactive [[NFT and tokenization | NFTs]] on Ethereum, addressing previous instances where users lost [[NFT and tokenization | NFTs]] due to inactive listings being exploited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. OpenC had shared the link to this new contract on its Twitter channel and via email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. It is believed that hackers exploited this legitimate communication as an opportunity to conduct phishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Some users have also suggested that the OpenC contract itself might have a flaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Recommended Security Measures

To enhance [[security_measures_for_cryptocurrency_wallets | security measures for cryptocurrency wallets]] and mitigate risks associated with [[NFT and tokenization | NFT]] transactions, particularly on platforms like OpenC, consider the following steps:

### Revoke Approvals

It is advisable to revoke approvals given to platforms like OpenC to reduce potential exposure to vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

*   Navigate to D Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   Select the "approval" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   If OpenC has been granted access, revoke it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Important Note:** Revoking a contract approval incurs gas fees, especially on the Ethereum network, so be mindful of the gas price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Stay Informed

Regularly check the main Twitter channels of platforms you use for the latest updates and advisories regarding [[protection_against_scams | security]] incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

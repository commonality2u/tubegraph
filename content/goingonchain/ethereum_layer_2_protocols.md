For 2022, Ethereum Layer 2 protocols are identified as a significant area of focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This sector is expected to generate considerable discussion, having already begun to see attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Market Trends and Adoption
*   **Smart Money Movement** Smart money has started to invest in Layer 2 protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Centralized Exchange Integration** Centralized exchanges are incorporating Layer 2 networks. For example, Binance has added [[layer_2_solutions_and_arbitrums_role | Arbitrum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, and OKX has added ZK-Sync <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Key Layer 2 Networks of Interest
Specific Layer 2 networks currently operating that are of high interest include:
*   Optimism Arbitrum One <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>
*   ZK-Sync <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>

## Multi-Chain Development and Layer 2 Implications
The move towards multi-chain operations by various DeFi protocols also intersects with Layer 2 development, particularly with the growth of [[polygon_and_layer_2_development | Polygon]].
*   **Popsicle Finance (ICE)** This protocol, which performs yield optimization on Uniswap V3, is expanding to [[polygon_and_layer_2_development | Polygon]] as Uniswap V3 also moves there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. This expansion is expected to bring a large influx of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Abracadabra (SPELL)** Abracadabra is currently on BSC (Binance Smart Chain) and plans to go to [[polygon_and_layer_2_development | Polygon]] very soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

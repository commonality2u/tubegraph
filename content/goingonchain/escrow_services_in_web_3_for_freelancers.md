Freelancers and independent contractors often face challenges with client non-payment or disagreements over work standards in traditional Web 2 environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Countries like Singapore even have websites dedicated to creating fair and progressive contracts for freelancers, as the absence of a contract can lead to "your words versus my words" situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. While Web 2 platforms like Dynamic Design, Fiverr, or Upwork provide services, the Web3 space offers new solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Trust Treaty: A Web3 Escrow Service

Trust Treaty is a Web3 escrow service that functions as a refundable [[smart_contracts_in_freelance_agreements | smart contract]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. It aims to address the common pain points for freelancers by securing funds and providing a [[Dispute resolution in Web 3 freelance contracts | dispute resolution]] mechanism on the blockchain.

### How Trust Treaty Works

The process typically begins with a client (e.g., "Client Alice") looking to hire a service provider (e.g., "Service Provider Bob") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

1.  **Contract Creation**:
    *   The client creates a new contract on the Trust Treaty platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
    *   Essential information such as the contract title, detailed expectations from both parties, start and end dates, and the agreed price are entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
    *   Prices can be locked in using stablecoins like USD, USDT, and USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
    *   Platform fees and potential dispute costs are calculated and displayed, with these figures decreasing as the total price decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

2.  **Fund Commitment**:
    *   When the client commits payment, the funds are moved to a new wallet address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
    *   This new wallet is secured by the platform, and neither the client nor the service provider has direct access to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
    *   Users are represented by their wallet addresses, allowing for anonymity, which is beneficial for designers showcasing work on platforms like Twitter who wish to remain pseudonymous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

3.  **Contract Formalization**:
    *   Once all information is filled, the client signs the contract, which formalizes it and generates a unique link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
    *   This link is shared with the service provider. Upon clicking the link, the service provider can review the contract details, title, and settlement value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
    *   If satisfied, the service provider signs the contract, making it effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

4.  **Work and Payment**:
    *   With an effective contract, both parties can communicate using the platform's UI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
    *   Once the work is completed, the service provider can request payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
    *   If everything is satisfactory, the client finalizes the agreement, releasing the funds to the service provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### [[Dispute resolution in Web 3 freelance contracts | Dispute Resolution]]

Should issues arise, the client can initiate a dispute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

*   Both the client and service provider submit their evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   Two independent dispute agents are assigned to analyze the situation and provide assessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   If both agents agree, their decision is final, and funds are disbursed accordingly (either to the provider or refunded to the client) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   If the agents disagree, a manager is called in to provide the final decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### [[Risks and considerations in using Web 3 platforms for freelancers | Risks and Considerations]]

Despite its benefits, using such platforms comes with certain [[Risks and considerations in using Web 3 platforms for freelancers | risks]]:

*   **Platform Risk**: If the platform ceases to operate, the funding wallet, which is controlled by the platform and not accessible by the client or service provider, could become inaccessible, leading to potential loss of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Dispute Decision Bias**: While dispute agents make independent decisions, the human element might still introduce bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

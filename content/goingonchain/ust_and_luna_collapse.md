The collapse of Terra's native token, LUNA, and its algorithmic stablecoin, UST, was a "super tough" event for many investors, leading to liquidations and significant losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The event was attributed to several contributing factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Contributing Factors to the Downfall

### Coordinated Attack
One primary factor was a coordinated attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Attackers acquired 1 billion UST, leveraged it to borrow 3 billion BTC, and then sold the BTC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This action caused a de-peg of UST, triggering a bank run on Anchor Protocol as people began to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### [[ust_mechanism_and_market_panic | UST Mechanism and Market Panic]]
The [[ust_mechanism_and_market_panic | Terra UST mechanism]] played a critical role in the collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. When UST is sold, it causes more LUNA to be minted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This created a "dead loop" or "vicious cycle": the more people sold UST, the more LUNA supply was created, driving down LUNA's price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

The Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) attempted to stabilize UST using a reserve of Bitcoin (BTC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. However, their continuous selling of BTC to support UST also contributed to panic in the broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Macroeconomic and Regulatory Factors
The situation was exacerbated by wider macroeconomic events, including unfavorable economic data and high inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Additionally, the U.S. Treasury Secretary commented on UST, calling for increased regulation of stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This contributed to a general sense of unease regarding [[stablecoin_vulnerabilities | stablecoin vulnerabilities]] and the cryptocurrency market as a whole, which also saw [[significant_cryptocurrency_failures_in_2022_such_as_luna_and_ftx | significant cryptocurrency failures in 2022]].

## Immediate Aftermath and Outlook
Following these events, UST de-pegged, and LUNA's price dropped significantly, falling below 10 cents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Terra's stated priority, according to tweets, was to restore the UST de-peg over stabilizing the price of LUNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This strategy involved continued burning, which paradoxically produced even more LUNA, causing its price to drop further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

The large sell-off related to LUNA also led to a decline in Bitcoin's price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. There was even a brief period where USDT, another major stablecoin, lost its peg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Despite the pain experienced by investors, some in the community remain committed to the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Further details from one of the attackers' "victory lap" Twitter threads offer additional insight into the coordinated attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

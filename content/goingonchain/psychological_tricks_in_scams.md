Scammers often employ psychological tactics to manipulate victims into losing their funds. One such example involves a scam promising a "front running bot" for PancakeSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## The "Front Running Bot" Scam Example

This particular [[crypto_scam_awareness | scam]] uses a YouTube channel to promote a script that allegedly creates a bot capable of [[front_running_scams | front-running]] transactions on PancakeSwap to generate profits, specifically promising at least 10 BNB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

### Initial Lure

The initial lure is the promise of easy, significant profit (10 BNB) through an automated system, preying on the desire for quick returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

### The "Sunk Cost" Trap

A key psychological trick in this scam involves the "sunk cost" fallacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. After an initial, smaller investment of BNB, the bot is designed not to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The scammer then provides a lame excuse, claiming the victim didn't invest enough BNB to trigger the [[front_running_scams | front running]] and pressures them to put in more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. At this point, victims might be willing to invest more to try and recover their original capital and achieve the promised 10 BNB, making it a psychological trick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Artificial Social Proof

The scam channel attempts to build credibility through fabricated social proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. It displays a large number of followers (e.g., 12,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Crucially, the comments section is filled with overwhelmingly positive comments, with no negative feedback, which is "too good to be true" and a significant red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This creates a false sense of legitimacy and encourages others to believe the scam is real due to the apparent success of others.

## Recognizing Red Flags

Beyond the psychological manipulation, there are often clear red flags to identify such scams:
*   A channel with many followers but only one video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   Comments that are uniformly positive and seem "too good to be true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   Code that triggers calls to an unknown wallet address, as blindly copying and pasting code without understanding where funds are being sent is dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

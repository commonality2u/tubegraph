NFTs can be used to generate [[NFT with Passive Income | passive income]] not through trading, but through the utility of their associated tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The market for these tokens exists because they have specific utilities and use cases within their respective ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## CyberKongz

CyberKongz are considered an "OG" in providing [[NFT with Passive Income | passive income]] via NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. There are 1,000 CyberKongz in total supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. As of the recording, the floor price for a CyberKong NFT was 155 ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### Bananas Token Utility

Purchasing a CyberKong allows the owner to earn 10 "bananas" per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Each banana is valued at $75, meaning a CyberKong generates $750 per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

Bananas have several key utilities within the CyberKongz ecosystem:
*   **Set Biography:** Users need bananas to set a biography for their CyberKong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Rename:** Bananas are required to rename a CyberKong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Breeding:** Bananas are essential for breeding new "Baby Kongz" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Bear Deluxe

Bear Deluxe NFTs have a total supply of 6,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The floor price for a Bear Deluxe NFT is 2.55 ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Honey Token Utility

Each Bear Deluxe NFT can earn one "jug of honey" per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. While the price of honey was not yet established at the time of recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, honey has specific utilities:
*   **Transformation:** Honey can be combined with a beehive to create a "b the lightning" NFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Minting:** A "b the lightning" NFT is capable of minting 0.13 honey per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   > [!INFO] Game-like Economy
    > NFTs, like Bear Deluxe, are increasingly becoming more like a game in their utility and economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Anon-Mine

Anon-Mine NFTs have a floor price of approximately 9 ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. There were originally 10,000 "minted mice" NFTs, but 6,450 have been burned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The remaining 3,550 mice are crucial as they are the only ones capable of breeding and producing new mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### Cheese Token Utility

Anon-Mine uses a different mechanism for its utility token, "cheese" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Staking:** Users can stake their mice to earn cheese, specifically one cheese for one mouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. A maximum of 10 mice can be staked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Purchase:** Cheese can also be acquired through Uniswap or private sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Breeding:** The primary utility of cheese is to breed new mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
    *   To breed, two mice are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
    *   The two mice used for breeding must be burned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
    *   The newly produced mouse cannot be bred further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

These examples demonstrate how NFTs, through their associated utility tokens like bananas, honey, and cheese, create ecosystems where the tokens have clear use cases beyond simple speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. However, it is important to conduct thorough personal research, as these are considered "farming tokens" that could be subject to dumping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

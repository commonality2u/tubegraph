The inverted yield curve is identified as a signal of a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This occurs in a market environment where the Federal Reserve is actively working to drive down inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Their objective is to continue raising interest rates until inflation decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The market has demonstrated selling activity ever since the [[impact_of_interest_rate_hikes_on_the_market | interest rate hikes]] began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This tightening by the Fed results in less equity within the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

Despite these signals, the market can remain irrational for longer than an individual can stay solvent, potentially leading to more selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

The Phantom Network is a blockchain platform that initiated operations on October 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Decentralized Nature
Projects operating on the Phantom Network, such as 'Guys', aim to be decentralized and non-custodial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. A key differentiator for these platforms is the absence of traditional governance structures or Venture Capital (VC) involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. All revenue generated from such platforms is designed to be distributed back to token holders and equity providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### Multisig Implementation
Despite some project teams on Phantom being [[team_anonymity_and_potential_risks_in_cryptocurrencies | anonymous]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, they can implement security measures like multi-signature (multisig) protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. For instance, 'Guys' implemented a multisig system where any code changes require the signatures of three out of five high-profile individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. These individuals are recognized within the Phantom and wider [[risks_associated_with_decentralized_finance_defi_and_centralized_finance_cefi | DeFi industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Additionally, a two-day time lock delay is in place for proposed changes, enhancing transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:24]</a>.

## Market Position
The Phantom Network is characterized by rapid capital movement within its ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. As of the transcript's recording, a project like 'Guys Finance' maintained the second-highest Total Value Locked (TVL) among protocols running on the Phantom Network, indicating its strong potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:37]</a>.

Tornado Cash is a service designed to make cryptocurrency transactions untraceable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. It functions as a "washing machine" where users deposit their crypto, which then becomes untraceable upon withdrawal to a new destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Role in the OpenSea Phishing Attack

Following a phishing attack on OpenSea, where 17 users fell victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, the hacker's wallet was tracked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The stolen Ethereum (Eth) was subsequently sent to Tornado Cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The situation is currently under investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

This attack was prompted by OpenSea's release of a new smart contract, intended to upgrade and delete inactive NFTs on Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. OpenSea communicated this through their Twitter channel and email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, which may have been exploited by the hacker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Some users have also suggested a flaw in OpenSea's contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Countermeasures and Prevention

To help [[preventing_cryptocurrency_scams | prevent cryptocurrency scams]] and protect against similar incidents involving [[how_cryptocurrency_wallets_are_manipulated_in_scams | cryptocurrency wallets manipulated in scams]], users can revoke approval given to OpenSea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This can be done via platforms like Dbank, where users can see and revoke OpenSea's access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. It's important to note that revoking a contract incurs gas fees on the Ethereum network, so users should be aware of the gas price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Users can also check OpenSea's main Twitter for the latest updates on the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

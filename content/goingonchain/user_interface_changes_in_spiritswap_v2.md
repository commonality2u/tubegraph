The development team behind Spirit Swap has undertaken a complete revamp of their user interface (UI) for [[spiritswap_v2_features_and_improvements | V2]], aiming for a significantly improved and more seamless user experience [00:00:38]. While many changes are "under the hood," the cosmetic updates are substantial [00:00:48].

## Revamped Homepage

The homepage of [[spiritswap_v2_features_and_improvements | Spiritswap V2]] provides a clear overview of a user's portfolio [00:00:52]. This comprehensive view incorporates five key components:
*   Tokens held in the wallet [00:01:01]
*   Liquidity provided on Spirit Swap [00:01:03]
*   Inspirit holdings [00:01:05]
*   Set limit orders [00:01:07]
*   Lending and borrowing activities [00:01:09]

## Simplified Bridge Functionality

The bridge interface has also received a revamp [00:01:13]. Previously, users had to bridge assets from a mainnet (e.g., Ethereum) to the Fantom chain first, and then execute a separate swap to acquire Spirit Swap tokens [00:01:16]. In [[spiritswap_v2_features_and_improvements | V2]], users can now swap while they bridge, consolidating the process into a single transaction [00:01:34]. This means assets can be moved from Ethereum to the Fantom chain and immediately converted into Spirit Swap tokens or other Fantom chain tokens [00:01:37]. Users can also choose between "cheapest" or "fastest" bridge modes based on their needs [00:01:50].

## Dedicated Liquidity Tab

The liquidity section in [[spiritswap_v2_features_and_improvements | V2]] now has its own dedicated tab [00:02:01]. Within this tab, users will find two distinct sections: "Classic" and "Stable" [00:02:06].

## Enhanced Inspirit Page

A significant improvement has been made to the Inspirit page's UI [00:03:36]. Compared to the more cluttered and messy V1 interface, the [[spiritswap_v2_features_and_improvements | V2]] Inspirit page is much clearer [00:03:44].

Key improvements include:
*   **Clear Voting Page** Users can easily see where their votes are directed and how to execute them [00:03:53].
*   **Comprehensive Dashboard** The dashboard displays current Inspirit balance and locked Spirit [00:03:59].
*   **Claimable Bribes Reward** A new feature allows users to claim their bribe rewards directly from the Inspirit page [00:04:07]. This addresses the previous difficulty in tracking and the tediousness of protocols dropping bribes to users [00:04:09].

These UI enhancements aim to make tracking and claiming rewards more straightforward for Inspirit holders [00:04:17].

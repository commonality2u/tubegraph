During what is described as the [[terra_nft_market_trends | NFT season on Terra]], the Galaxy Punks project has demonstrated significant success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Secondary Market Performance

Upon their release, Galaxy Punks were observed to be "fetching very good prices on the secondary market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This indicates strong demand and value retention or appreciation shortly after their launch.

> [!CAUTION] Market Risks and Due Diligence
> While projects like Galaxy Punks experience success, the [[terra_nft_market_trends | Terra NFT market]] is also characterized by scam incidents and "funny things" when activity is high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Two notable incidents highlight the risks:
>
> *   **Kara Waifu**: This project conducted a "rug pull," deleting all social media accounts after launching. It was also noted that their artwork was copied from other projects on different chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
> *   **Terabytes**: The artist behind this project also disappeared and deleted social media accounts; however, all collected funds were reportedly donated to the Angel Protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Speculation arose that the community's negative feedback on the artwork or the use of a pixel drawing generator contributed to this outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

> These incidents underscore the importance of conducting thorough personal research before investing in any projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

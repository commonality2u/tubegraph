Inverse Finance recently upgraded its governance token, introducing [[Inverse Plus tokenomics and value proposition | Inverse Plus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This upgrade aims to add more value to the governance token, addressing a common issue where such tokens often do not accrue value or are solely used for voting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. [[Inverse Plus tokenomics and value proposition | Inverse Plus]] is described as a "positive sum rewards token" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Components of Inverse Finance
[[Inverse Plus tokenomics and value proposition | Inverse Plus]] integrates with three main products within Inverse Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>:

1.  **IMV Token**
    *   The platform's native token, which users can buy and stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
2.  **Anchor**
    *   A lending and borrowing platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. As of the recording, it had a total TVL (Total Value Locked) of approximately $65 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Users can deposit assets to earn base rewards and additional rewards in IMV tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
3.  **DOLA**
    *   Inverse Finance's stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. [[Yield farming and liquidity pools in Inverse Finance | Yield farming]] opportunities for DOLA are available on Ethereum and Fantom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. DOLA can be swapped on Curve or Stabilizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
    *   **Stabilizer** is Inverse Finance's own [[Yield farming and liquidity pools in Inverse Finance | liquidity pool]], consisting of a DAI and DOLA pair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. It features a 0.4% swap fee and guarantees a fixed rate of 0.996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, with approximately $4 million in liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Benefits of Staking IMV
When users supply IMV to Anchor, they receive xIMV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Holding xIMV provides several benefits, enhancing the value proposition of the governance token:

1.  **IMV Emission**: xIMV holders receive IMV emissions, distributed per Ethereum block, which occurs approximately 6,400 times per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The Annual Percentage Yield (APY) for staking IMV to get xIMV is capped at 500% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This cap can only be changed through a new governance vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. There is no maximum supply for the IMV token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, but the DAO can introduce a cap on emissions if they become too high, at which point minting would cease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
2.  **Protocol Revenue Share**: IMV stakers receive a portion of the protocol's revenue, which is generated from borrowing interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
3.  **[[Governance and voting rights within Inverse Finance | Voting Rights]]**: xIMV grants holders [[Governance and voting rights within Inverse Finance | voting rights]] within the Inverse Finance DAO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The governance page shows active polls, with 35 proposals made and 32 passed, including the recent [[Inverse Plus tokenomics and value proposition | Inverse Plus]] proposal, all conducted via on-chain voting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
4.  **Collateral for Borrowing DOLA**: xIMV can be used as collateral to borrow DOLA stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This feature allows users to continue earning IMV emissions (e.g., 122% APY as observed) and protocol revenue while using their staked IMV as collateral for loans, demonstrating capital efficiency where funds are not locked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Transparency
Inverse Finance features a transparency tab on its platform, which is uncommon for projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This section displays smart contract links and illustrates how these contracts interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. It also provides numerical data, akin to reading a company's balance sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

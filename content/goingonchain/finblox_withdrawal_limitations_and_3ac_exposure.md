From: [[goingonchain]] <br/> 

Finblox has recently implemented limitations on user withdrawals, leading to concerns among its user base. This decision was made due to the platform's cited exposure to Three Arrows Capital (3AC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. An in-depth [[onchain_analysis_of_finblox_wallets | on-chain analysis]] performed by a Reddit user revealed significant insights into Finblox's wallet activities and its potential liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Imposed Withdrawal Limits

As of June 16, Finblox reduced its withdrawal limits to a maximum of $500 per day and $1,500 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This change occurred shortly after rumors began circulating about Three Arrows Capital (3AC) becoming insolvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Users had been initiating withdrawals before the limitations were put in place, particularly for stablecoins like USDC due to their attractive interest rates (15% previously, then 12%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## Uncovering Finblox's Financial Flows

An individual with no prior experience in parallel analysis undertook a thorough [[onchain_analysis_of_finblox_wallets | on-chain analysis]] of Finblox's wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The analysis involved tracing transactions using publicly available blockchain explorers like Bitquery.io <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, Zapper.fi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, and Abound.finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

### Identifying Core Wallets
The process began by identifying personal deposit addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. When users deposit funds, Finblox creates a unique deposit address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Funds from these unique addresses are then automatically forwarded within minutes to a main "hot wallet" (e.g., an address ending in FA9E for Ethereum-based tokens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This main hot wallet serves as the central collection point for all incoming user deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

The withdrawal wallet (e.g., an address ending in D20 for Ethereum-based tokens) was identified by observing where user withdrawals originated from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Analysis of its outflow showed consistent daily withdrawals of $500, aligning with Finblox's daily cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. This confirmed it as the platform's primary withdrawal wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

For Bitcoin, Finblox appears to use a single wallet for both deposits and withdrawals, as confirmed by a user's Bitcoin withdrawal coming from the same address as their deposit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>.

### Tracing Funds to Other Platforms
Using a Sankey diagram feature on Bitquery.io <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>, the analyst traced large outflows from Finblox's main deposit wallet. This revealed significant fund movements to other platforms:

*   **Binance:** Over $5.2 million in USD value (primarily USDC) was observed flowing into a Binance "hold wallet" (Binance hold wallet #14) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. This indicates Finblox uses Binance as a deposit account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
*   **FTX:** Two FTX deposit wallets (ending in A6 and DD) received funds from Finblox's main deposit wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. These wallets then transferred funds to well-known FTX wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. Interestingly, these FTX wallets also received funds from BlockFi and Nexo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>, suggesting Finblox might have provided user funds to these competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. The fact that these FTX wallets also received funds directly from the Circle Treasury fund, which typically only deals with large institutional organizations, further indicated they were not just end-user accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

### The Three Arrows Capital (3AC) Connection
A crucial finding was an address (ending in 914) which received approximately $3.2 million USD value in USDC from Finblox's deposit wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. This 914 wallet was found to send a significant amount of funding (around $8 million USDC) to a main Three Arrows Capital (3AC) wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. While the 914 wallet also received funds from other sources like FTX and Compound, Finblox's specific contribution to it was $3.2 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.

Historically, Finblox had made small, fixed transfers to 3AC in late 2021 (e.g., 330k and 200k USDC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. However, a notable change occurred starting May 13, the week the UST stablecoin began its de-pegging event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. From this point, Finblox began sending considerable and random amounts of funds, including small amounts of USDC and Singapore Dollars, to 3AC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>. The last such transaction was on June 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>, coinciding with initial rumors of 3AC's insolvency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>. This suggests Finblox continued sending funds to 3AC during a critical period, potentially at 3AC's request for "anything they had" to cover their liquidity issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.

The estimated exposure to 3AC is around $3.1 to $3.2 million USD value, though it could be higher if 3AC also received Finblox funds via FTX or Binance accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>. Based on this analysis, it's believed that 10% to 30% of user deposits with Finblox might be lost if funds from 3AC are unrecoverable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>.

## Finblox's Role as an Intermediary

The analysis suggests Finblox may be acting primarily as an [[potential_intermediary_role_of_finblox_in_fund_management | intermediary]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>. While Finblox advertised "eight sophisticated different yielding strategies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>, the on-chain data indicates that most user funds were simply being transferred to other platforms like Binance, FTX, Nexo, and BlockFi, as well as their own vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>. These external platforms offer their own money-making strategies, such as lending and borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>. This raises the question of why users would deposit funds with Finblox if they could directly access these other platforms without an intermediary, especially when those platforms (like Nexo and Vault) currently have no withdrawal limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>.

## Bitcoin and Solana Wallet Observations

The analysis of Finblox's Bitcoin wallet showed only a small amount of Bitcoin (around 1.19 BTC, equivalent to $25k USD) remaining in the wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>. The maximum amount ever held was 4.8 BTC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>. The inflow and outflow of Bitcoin were observed to be consistently small amounts, leading to the conclusion that these funds were likely "idle" and being used for direct user withdrawals rather than being deployed in yielding strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>. Despite Finblox offering interest on Bitcoin (around 5.5% - 5.75% APY) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>, there was no indication of connection to larger platforms for yield generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>. A similar observation was made for Solana wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>.

## Key Takeaways for Users

This [[onchain_analysis_of_finblox_wallets | on-chain analysis]] serves as a crucial lesson for cryptocurrency investors. Before committing funds to new lending protocols or platforms, especially those with smaller names, users should conduct their own research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a>. Techniques like tracing wallet movements can help identify where funds are actually going and whether the platform is genuinely employing sophisticated yield strategies or merely acting as an intermediary to other platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>. Diversifying funds across numerous platforms is also highly recommended for risk management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

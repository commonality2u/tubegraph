## What is EIP1559?
EIP1559 is an Ethereum Improvement Proposal that fundamentally changed the fee mechanism on the Ethereum blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Previously, Ethereum used an auction-based system for gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. With EIP1559, fees are broken down into two parts: a "miner tip" and a "base fee" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

## Impact on Ethereum Supply
The critical aspect of EIP1559 is that the "base fee" portion of the transaction fees is burned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. This burning mechanism has a direct impact on Ethereum's supply:

*   **Deflationary Periods** At the peak of NFT activity and high network usage, the burning mechanism led to periods where Ethereum was deflationary, meaning more ETH was burned than was produced daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Historical Burn Data** Since EIP1559 was implemented, approximately 2 million ETH have been burned, resulting in a net issuance of only about 1.2 million ETH for that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## Deflationary Potential
When EIP1559's burning mechanism is combined with the significant reduction in daily Ethereum issuance following [[understanding_the_ethereum_merge|the Merge]], the overall supply of ETH in the market is expected to decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This means that in the long run, Ethereum has the potential to become deflationary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

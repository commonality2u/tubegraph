One trading strategy involves "scripting" trades around Ask Me Anything (AMA) sessions, particularly with tokens like Wmemo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Strategy Overview

This approach entails buying back a token, such as Wmemo, after an AMA session, even if it was previously sold. The speaker mentioned selling Wmemo three days prior and then buying it back the day after an AMA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Short-Term Approach

This is explicitly stated as "not a long-term trip" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, indicating it's a short-term, speculative strategy. The intention is to sell the accumulated tokens soon after the AMA-related activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## General Investment Advice

When engaging in any [[investment_strategies_in_a_volatile_market | investment strategies in a volatile market]] like crypto, it's crucial to only invest money you are prepared to lose, as cryptocurrencies are "super volatile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The speaker also shares a broader [[crypto_portfolio_strategy | Crypto portfolio strategy]] which includes continuing to [[dca_strategy_during_bear_market | DCA strategy during bear market]] on strong projects like BTC, FTM, and Merit Circle, noting that the best time to accumulate is during a bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

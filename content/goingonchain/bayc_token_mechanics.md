The Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT collection is associated with the APE coin token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. At one point, holding a BAYC NFT could yield approximately 10,000 APE coin tokens, valued around $130,000 when APE coin was priced at $13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## APE Coin Airdrop Mechanics

A unique aspect of the APE coin airdrop was the absence of a snapshot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This meant that as long as one owned a BAYC NFT, they were eligible to withdraw or claim the APE coin tokens once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This "no snapshot" rule led to an increase in the BAYC floor price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## The Flash Loan Strategy

An anonymous individual leveraged a technique called a flash loan to capitalize on the APE coin airdrop mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Understanding the Vault

The anon located a vault on NFTX that contained five BAYC NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This vault allowed the BAYC NFTs to be tokenized, similar to how REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) enable ownership of parts of underlying assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Crucially, these five BAYC NFTs in the vault had not yet claimed their APE coin tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### The Flash Loan Process

Knowing that there was no snapshot for the airdrop and claims could be made once per BAYC NFT, the anon executed the following steps:
1.  **Acquire a BAYC NFT**: The anon initially purchased a BAYC NFT from OpenSea, costing around $300,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
2.  **Initiate Flash Loan**: Using the purchased BAYC as collateral, the anon took a flash loan from the NFTX vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
3.  **Borrow and Claim**: In a single Ethereum transaction, the anon borrowed the five BAYC NFTs from the vault, used them to claim approximately 60,000 APE coin tokens, and immediately returned the borrowed BAYC NFTs back to the vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
4.  **Sell and Profit**: The anon then sold the originally purchased BAYC NFT back into the vault and sold the newly claimed APE coin tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

> [!NOTE] What is a Flash Loan?
> A flash loan is a unique DeFi primitive that allows users to borrow large amounts of cryptocurrency without collateral, provided the loan is repaid within the same blockchain transaction (block) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This mechanism enables complex arbitrage or exploitation strategies to be executed instantaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Platforms like Aave (formerly known as RV) provide documentation and tutorials on flash loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Outcome and Implications

Through this intricate series of transactions, the anon reportedly profited by approximately $800,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This event sparked discussion on whether such an action constitutes an attack or an arbitrage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

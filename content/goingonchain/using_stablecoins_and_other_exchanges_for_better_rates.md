Following Binance's service restrictions in Singapore, users were prompted to explore [[comparing_alternative_exchanges_based_on_liquidity_and_fees | alternative exchanges]] and strategies for managing their crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This article outlines a personal flow utilizing various platforms and stablecoins to achieve better rates and flexibility.

## Binance Restrictions in Singapore

On September 27, 2021, Binance announced that users in Singapore would no longer have access to several services, effective October 26, 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>:
*   Fiat deposit and withdrawal (DBS remit would cease to work) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   Spot trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   Liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
Users were advised to exit all assets by October 26, 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. While staking withdrawals after this date were reportedly possible, users concerned about their assets were advised to move them to personal wallets like Trust Wallet or MetaMask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Futures trading was noted as a different service and thus not affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Alternative Exchanges Comparison

A poll was conducted to identify popular [[comparing_alternative_exchanges_based_on_liquidity_and_fees | alternative exchanges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The comparison focused on three key components:
*   [[comparing_alternative_exchanges_based_on_liquidity_and_fees | Liquidity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
*   Number of coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>
*   [[comparing_alternative_exchanges_based_on_liquidity_and_fees | Fees]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>

Binance was used as the benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Key Findings:

*   **[[comparing_alternative_exchanges_based_on_liquidity_and_fees | Liquidity]]**: Huobi (4p) and FTX were identified as having decent [[comparing_alternative_exchanges_based_on_liquidity_and_fees | liquidity]], which allows for tighter spreads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Number of Coins**: For those interested in more unknown coins, KuCoin and Huobi (Obi) were top contenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **[[comparing_alternative_exchanges_based_on_liquidity_and_fees | Fees]]**: For frequent traders, FTX offers the lowest [[comparing_alternative_exchanges_based_on_liquidity_and_fees | fees]]. Holding FTX tokens provides an additional 3% discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Personal Investment Strategy

A personal flow involves a combination of Gemini and KuCoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>:

1.  **Funding Gemini**: DBS Remit is used to deposit funds into Gemini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
2.  **Stablecoin Conversion**: Funds are converted to UST, a [[types_of_stablecoins_and_their_distinctions | stablecoin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
3.  **Transfer to KuCoin**: Gemini offers 10 free withdrawals per month, which is utilized to send UST to KuCoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
4.  **Coin Purchase**: Desired coins are purchased on KuCoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
5.  **Off-Ramp Options**:
    *   Sell purchased coins and send to BSC (Binance Smart Chain) to cash out from an expert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
    *   Sell for UST and send the UST to Anchor Protocol to [[earning_interest_on_stablecoins | earn 19.44 APY]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This acts like a bank for [[earning_interest_on_stablecoins | earning interest on stablecoins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
6.  **Standby Account**: A Huobi account is kept as a standby option for peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions with Singapore dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

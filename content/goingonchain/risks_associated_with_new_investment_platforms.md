When considering new investment platforms, especially in the cryptocurrency space, it's crucial to understand the associated risks. These platforms often offer attractive yields but may come with less regulatory oversight compared to more established entities.

## Platform Risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>

The biggest concern with new investment platforms is the inherent platform risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This refers to the risks associated with the operational stability, security, and integrity of the platform itself.

> [!WARNING] New platforms, such as Finblox, are noted as being "quite new" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This newness can imply a lack of a long-standing track record or established security protocols compared to older, more vetted platforms.

## Regulatory Scrutiny and Know Your Customer (KYC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>

The level of regulatory approval and the implementation of KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures are significant indicators of a platform's legitimacy and security.

> [!NOTE] While platforms like Hodlnaut have received "in-principle approval" from MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore), indicating they have been "vetted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, newer platforms may lack this level of scrutiny.

For instance, upon signing up for Finblox, there was no KYC process required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. The absence of KYC can indicate a higher risk profile for a platform.

## Features and Yields Offered

New platforms like Finblox offer competitive yields on stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies:

*   **USDC and USDT:** 15% APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>
*   **SGD Coin (XSGD):** 6.5% APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
*   **Avalanche (AVAX):** 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>
*   **Polygon (MATIC):** 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>
*   **Axie Infinity Shards (AXS):** 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>

Interest is paid daily on Finblox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Platform Accessibility and Usability

Finblox currently operates primarily via a mobile application, with no web interface available at present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The app interface is described as "pretty similar" to Hodlnaut's, featuring a "saving board" and "crypto vault" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Supported Chains and Fees

Finblox integrates with various blockchain networks, including Solana, BNB, and Polygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, which generally results in cheaper transfer fees compared to platforms primarily using ERC20 chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

> [!NOTE] While depositing MATIC, users can choose the Polygon network for lower gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. However, minting XSGD and transferring it to Finblox might still incur ERC20 fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

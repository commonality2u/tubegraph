BendDAO is a lending and borrowing platform for NFTs that facilitates the [[instant_liquidity_for_nft_buyers_and_sellers | instant liquidity]] of digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The platform allows users to deposit their NFTs and borrow ETH against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## NFT Lending and Borrowing
Users can deposit select blue-chip NFTs to borrow ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. While the platform offers high APR for supplying ETH, the current interest for borrowing ETH against an NFT is extremely high (e.g., minus 92%) due to a lack of deposit supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

The platform also enables users to buy NFTs at a discount through a "down payment" system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. For instance, a Mayc NFT with a full price of 14.6 ETH could be acquired for 11.05 ETH, with the remaining amount considered a loan from the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This loan can be repaid at any time, subject to interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Liquidation State
A key feature of BendDAO is the process for [[liquidation_process_for_bluna | liquidating]] NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. When an NFT collateral falls below a certain threshold relative to the borrowed amount, it enters a [[liquidation_process_for_bluna | liquidating]] state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

> For example, if a Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT owner borrowed 10.82 ETH and the floor price of the NFT dropped to 12.32 ETH, the NFT would enter a liquidating state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

The owner of the NFT has a 48-hour window to redeem their NFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. If the NFT is not redeemed within this period, it will be awarded to the highest bidder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Bidding Process
Users can bid on these [[liquidation_process_for_bluna | liquidating]] NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. A crucial rule for bidding is that the new bid price must always be greater than the current highest bid price plus an additional one percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### Challenges for Bidders
Despite the potential to acquire NFTs at a discount, there are challenges associated with the bidding process:
1.  **High Utilization Rate**: A high utilization rate on the platform means that even if you land ETH, you might not be able to withdraw it readily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
2.  **ETH Lock-up**: When placing a bid, bidders are required to lock up their ETH for 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This poses a risk for the bidder, as their capital is tied up, which has led to a low number of participants in the bidding process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This can also mean that securing apes at these prices might not always be a good deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

BendDAO aims to provide [[instant_liquidity_for_nft_buyers_and_sellers | liquidity]] for NFT holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, but it needs to address these challenges to achieve its goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

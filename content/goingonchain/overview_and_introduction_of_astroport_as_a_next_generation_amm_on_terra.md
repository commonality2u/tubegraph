From: [[goingonchain]] <br/> 

Astroport is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) designed for the [[decentralized_finance_on_terra_luna | Terra]] blockchain. It functions similarly to Sushi Swap, allowing users to exchange one token for another in a decentralized manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While [[comparisons_between_astroport_and_other_amms_like_terraswap_and_uniswap | Terraswap]] already exists on Terra, Astroport aims to address its limitations and provide a more comprehensive and efficient trading experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Why Astroport is Needed

Despite the presence of [[comparisons_between_astroport_and_other_amms_like_terraswap_and_uniswap | Terraswap]], the [[decentralized_finance_on_terra_luna | Terra]] ecosystem requires a more advanced AMM for several reasons:

*   **Limited Functionality of Terraswap** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>: [[comparisons_between_astroport_and_other_amms_like_terraswap_and_uniswap | Terraswap]] was initially built to support the Mirror Protocol and is not designed as a full-featured AMM, offering only basic swap functionalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. More advanced AMMs, like Spirit Swap, offer additional [[features_and_advantages_of_astroport_including_user_interface_and_astro_generators | features]] such as charts and APY displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Inefficiencies of Traditional AMM Models** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>: Traditional AMMs, such as [[comparisons_between_astroport_and_other_amms_like_terraswap_and_uniswap | Uniswap]], primarily use a single "constant product" pool formula. While effective for highly volatile pairs like Bitcoin and Ethereum, this model leads to significant slippage for stablecoin pools or newly launched tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Loss of Native Protocol Benefits** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>: Providing liquidity on [[comparisons_between_astroport_and_other_amms_like_terraswap_and_uniswap | Terraswap]] can result in the loss of benefits from the native protocol. For example, providing ANC-UST liquidity on Terraswap means missing out on the staking benefits available directly on Anchor Protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Key Features and Advantages

Astroport is designed to address these challenges with several innovative [[features_and_advantages_of_astroport_including_user_interface_and_astro_generators | features]]:

*   **Enhanced User Interface and Experience (UI/UX)**: Astroport provides a superior UI/UX, including chart trends and a more user-friendly interface beyond just a simple swap screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Multiple Pool Types**: Instead of a single constant product pool, Astroport offers three different types of pools. This diversification aims to optimize exchange rates and significantly reduce slippage for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Astro Generators (Double Farming)**: This is one of Astroport's most powerful [[features_and_advantages_of_astroport_including_user_interface_and_astro_generators | features]]. When liquidity is provided to Astro generators (e.g., ANC-UST), a proxy smart contract ties the liquidity to the native protocol (e.g., Anchor Protocol). This allows users to earn not only Astroport tokens but also the benefits from the native protocol, a concept known as "double farming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Team and Launch Status

Astroport is developed by "Astropod Joint Ventures," a collaboration of individuals from notable groups such as Delphi Digital, IDEO, and TFL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

As of the recording, Astroport is undergoing auditing and is expected to [[launch_details_and_token_drop_phases_for_astroport | launch]] around mid-November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. It will not have a traditional Initial Dex Offering (IDO) but rather a [[launch_details_and_token_drop_phases_for_astroport | token drop]] structured into three phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Astroport also features [[tokenomics_of_astroport_including_token_distribution_and_subtokens | two subtokens]] in addition to its main token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

Initially, [[liquidity_providers_and_incentives | liquidity pool providers]] and stakers engaged in [[yield_farming_and_liquidity_pools_in_inverse_finance | farming]] for DEX tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Historically, [[liquidity_providers_and_incentives | liquidity providers]] were often willing to sell their DEX tokens at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, which could lead to significant selling pressure on the token, as seen with BITS tokens before January 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Transformation by Voting and Bribes

The landscape for [[role_of_traders_and_protocols_in_dex | DEX]] tokens changed with the introduction of voting incentives and [[impact_of_crypto_bribes_on_decentralized_exchange_dex_tokens | crypto bribes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. DEXs began allocating a portion of their token emissions (e.g., 30% for BITS) based on votes, where protocols with the highest votes received the largest share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This shift provided a compelling reason for [[liquidity_providers_and_incentives | liquidity providers]] and stakers to hold onto their DEX tokens.

## Role of Liquidity Providers (LPs)

[[liquidity_providers_and_incentives | Liquidity providers]] are now strongly incentivized not to sell their DEX tokens because these tokens are essential for voting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Typically, LPs will vote for their own pools to help them win a larger share of the DEX token emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

The introduction of [[impact_of_crypto_bribes_on_decentralized_exchange_dex_tokens | crypto bribes]] further enhances this incentive. Projects may offer significant rewards (e.g., up to $100K) to DEX token holders who vote for their protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This attracts not only LPs from the bribing protocol's specific pool but also other DEX token holders who want to earn a cut of the bribe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Role of Stakers

Stakers, who already hold and stake DEX tokens, also benefit significantly from this system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Since they possess the necessary DEX tokens, they have no reason to sell them; instead, they can use them to vote and earn additional yield through [[impact_of_crypto_bribes_on_decentralized_exchange_dex_tokens | crypto bribes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Impact on DEX Token Prices

The combined actions of [[liquidity_providers_and_incentives | liquidity providers]] and stakers, driven by voting and [[impact_of_crypto_bribes_on_decentralized_exchange_dex_tokens | crypto bribes]], lead to increased buying pressure on DEX tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. As holders seek to accumulate more tokens to participate in voting and receive bribes, demand for the DEX token rises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. While this doesn't eliminate all selling pressure, the buying pressure created by these incentives can be strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Aligned Incentives

This system aligns the incentives of [[liquidity_providers_and_incentives | liquidity providers]] and stakers with the overall health of the DEX token. They are incentivized to hold and vote, which in turn leads to:
*   **Reduced Selling Pressure**: LPs and stakers have no reason to sell their DEX tokens because they can use them to vote and earn more yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Increased Liquidity**: When LPs remain engaged due to aligned incentives, the liquidity in the pools is stable, leading to low slippage for [[role_of_traders_and_protocols_in_dex | traders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Buying Pressure**: The desire to participate in voting and receive bribes encourages buying of the DEX token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

This setup indicates a mature incentive structure for DEX tokens, where all stakeholders, including [[liquidity_providers_and_incentives | liquidity providers]] and stakers, are aligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Without such alignment, a DEX token risks being merely a farming token with little intrinsic value or sustained demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

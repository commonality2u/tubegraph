[[Bitcoins backing and value | Bitcoin]] is not backed by any physical assets or government body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This differs from traditional assets like US Treasury bonds or gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Due to this lack of backing, [[Bitcoins backing and value | Bitcoin]] "can go to zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

Transferring UST to the Avalanche (AVAX) blockchain allows users to access various [[farming_opportunities_on_avalanche_with_ust | farming opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. On Avalanche, it's possible to earn up to 56% yield with the UST-AVAX pool, or about 17% in a stablecoin pool if concerned about impermanent loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Bridging UST to Avalanche

To bridge UST from Terra to Avalanche, a software called Satellite bridge is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Satellite Bridge Process
1.  **Select Source Chain and Asset**: Choose "Terra" as the source chain and "UST" as the source asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
2.  **Set Destination**: Input "AVAX" as the destination chain and provide your AVAX address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
3.  **Initiate Transfer**: Click "connect wallet" and then "transfer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This will prompt a signature request on your Metamask wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
4.  **Generate Deposit**: Signing the Metamask transaction initiates a one-time deposit for the recipient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Transfer Requirements and Fees
*   **Transfer Fee**: A 0.1% transfer fee applies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Minimum Transfer Amount**: The minimum amount for a transfer is 15 UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## The Keplr Wallet Prerequisite

Before using the Satellite bridge, it is necessary to use the Keplr Wallet, which is designed for the Cosmos ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Transferring UST to Keplr
*   **Move UST from Terra Station**: Users must first move their UST from their Terra Station wallet to their Keplr Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Input Amount**: Once UST is in the Keplr Wallet, input the desired transfer amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Approving the Keplr Transaction
*   **Keplr Wallet Approval**: The transfer will trigger an approval request on your Keplr Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Transaction Cost**: Approving the transaction costs approximately 0.004 LUNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Processing Time**: After approval, the transaction typically takes three to five minutes to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Confirming the Transfer

Upon completion of the transaction, your UST will be visible in your Metamask wallet on the Avalanche (AVAX) chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Farming Opportunities on Avalanche

With UST now on the Avalanche chain, you can navigate to platforms like Pangolin, choose the deposit option, and participate in stablecoin farming opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

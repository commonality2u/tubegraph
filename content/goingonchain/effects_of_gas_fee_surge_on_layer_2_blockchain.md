From: [[goingonchain]] <br/> 

The Arbitrum Odyssey campaign experienced a pause due to a significant surge in gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This unexpected increase led to high transaction costs, which is particularly notable for [[ethereum_layer_2_protocols | Layer 2]] (L2) solutions that are designed to offer cheaper transaction fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Impact of the Surge

A primary impact was that users attempting a swap faced a [[transaction_fees_and_minimum_transfers_in_crypto | swap fee]] of approximately $21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This high cost contradicted the expected affordability of [[ethereum_layer_2_protocols | L2]] transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Response and Solutions

To address the heavy load on the chain and reduce [[transaction_fees_and_minimum_transfers_in_crypto | gas fees]], the Arbitrum Odyssey campaign was paused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The campaign is set to resume following the launch of "Nitro" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Nitro is described as an accelerated version of Arbitrum, designed to alleviate the heavy load on the chain and subsequently reduce [[transaction_fees_and_minimum_transfers_in_crypto | gas fees]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

This article provides an update on a personal "degen play" involving [[snowbank_project_updates | Snowbank]], focusing on staking performance and project developments.

## Initial Investment and Performance
An investment of approximately $500 was made in Snowbank, with participation lasting around 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The initial Annual Percentage Yield (APY) for Snowbank was noted as "super crazy," but it was anticipated that this high APY would not last, and indeed, both the price and APY dropped after the video was recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The price of Snowbank had dropped 45% recently, aligning with a general downtrend observed in most cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### Profit/Loss Summary
Despite the price drop, the investment in Snowbank showed a profit:
*   **Initial Cost**: Approximately $500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>
*   **Current Holding**: 0.183 SSP (Snowbank's token receipt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>
*   **Current Price**: Snowbank is approximately $3,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>
*   **Current Balance**: $3,500 multiplied by 0.183 equals $640 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
*   **Profit**: Approximately $28 for the 10-day period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>

## Project Outlook and Developments
Initially, there were concerns that Snowbank might be a "rug pull" project due to the anonymity of its development team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. However, the project has demonstrated activity and introduced new initiatives, suggesting it may not be a rug pull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

Key developments include:
*   **Snowbank Pro Max**: An upcoming feature similar to OlympusDAO Pro, designed to help other projects own liquidity, with Snowbank earning small fees from these operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Airdrop for Stakers and Minters**: An airdrop is planned for users who staked and minted during the project's most challenging period, when the price dropped to a low of $1,600 before slowly recovering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **Introduction of [[market_impact_and_asset_movement_from_snowbank_to_snowdog | Snowdog]]**: A new coin introduced by the Snowbank team, aiming to become the main coin of the Avalanche ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. [[market_impact_and_asset_movement_from_snowbank_to_snowdog | Snowdog]] features a rebase token method for the first five days, followed by a large buyback of the coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

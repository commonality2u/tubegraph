Snowbank (SBB) is a crypto project highlighted for its high Annual Percentage Yield (APY), though it's noted that this APY is not sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. After an initial video about the project, both its price and APY experienced a significant drop, with the price falling by 45% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This occurred during a general downward trend in the crypto market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Investment Performance

An investment in Snowbank was made for approximately 10 days with an initial capital of $500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The investor held 0.183 SBB tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

At the time of the update:
*   The price of Snowbank was about $3,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   The balance was calculated as $3,500 multiplied by 0.183, totaling $640 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   This resulted in a profit of about 28% over 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Project Developments

Despite initial concerns about a potential "rug pull" due to an anonymous development team, Snowbank has been releasing new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The price of Snowbank had previously dropped to a low of $1,600 but has since started to climb back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Key developments include:
*   **[[snowbank_pro_max_and_new_developments | Snowbank Pro Max]]**: This initiative is similar to OlympusDAO Pro, where Snowbank assists other projects in owning their liquidity and earns small fees in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Airdrops**: Snowbank plans to conduct an airdrop for stakers and minters who supported the project during its challenging period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Snowdog**: A related token, Snowdog (SNOW), was released with the aim of becoming the main coin on the Avalanche blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. [[snowdog_rebase_token_method | Snowdog has an interesting concept]], utilizing a rebase token method for its first five days, followed by a large buyback of the coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. More details on Snowdog's mechanics are available in a separate video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

As the Avalanche ecosystem experiences growth ("mooning"), the future of Snowdog is anticipated with excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Hundred Finance offers users two primary ways to interact with their crypto assets: supplying them to take loans or staking them to earn rewards. The choice between these options depends on the user's objective, as they are mutually exclusive for the same asset [01:07:00].

## Supplying Assets and Taking Loans

When users [[earning_interest_on_crypto_assets | supply a stable or crypto asset]] on Hundred Finance, they earn a [[supply_apy_vs_stake_apr | supply APY]] on that asset [00:00:19]. As a receipt for the supplied asset, users receive an "h token" (e.g., supplying MEME yields hMEME) [00:00:26].

The main purpose of supplying assets is to enable borrowing. If a user wishes to take a loan, they must supply their asset [01:11:00]. For instance, supplying 500 MEME allows a user to borrow another token like SPELL, up to 50% of their limit [01:21:00].

It is important to note that if an asset is staked, it cannot be used as collateral to take a loan [01:07:00]. If a user has an active loan, staking a portion of their supplied collateral will reduce their available supply value, consequently reducing the amount they can borrow [01:36:00].

## Staking Assets and Earning Rewards

To earn the [[supply_apy_vs_stake_apr | stake APR]], which comes in the form of HND tokens, users must actively stake their h tokens [00:00:48]. For example, after supplying MEME and receiving hMEME, a user needs to stake the hMEME to earn the HND token APR [00:51:00].

Users can view their HND rewards balance and collect them from the HND section of the platform [01:51:00]. The dashboard provides an overview of both the supply APR and the staking APR earned on the HND token [02:05:00].

### HND and veHND

Once HND tokens are earned, users have the option to lock them up to earn further rewards and gain voting power [02:14:00]. This locking process converts HND into veHND (Vote-Escrowed HND), with the amount of veHND received depending on the lock-up duration [02:29:00]:
*   Locking 100 HND for 4 years yields 100 veHND [02:33:00].
*   Locking 100 HND for 2 years yields 50 veHND [02:37:00].

With veHND, users can perform two main actions:
1.  **Vote on Pools**: Users can vote to direct more HND rewards to specific pools. Pools with more votes receive a higher average APR on HND rewards [02:58:00].
2.  **Boost Personal Rewards**: Users can boost their own staking rewards by up to 2.5 times [03:09:00]. For example, an 18.87% APR can be boosted to 45% [03:13:00]. Hundred Finance provides a calculator to determine the necessary veHND for maximum boost [03:23:00]. Applying the boost triggers a transaction [03:46:00]. Voting for boost can only be done every 10 days, coinciding with the end of an "epoch" [03:31:00]. The APR can change in subsequent epochs based on other users' votes [03:53:00].

## Summary of Options

| Objective         | Action                                | Outcome                                                                   | Consideration                                                       |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Take a loan**   | Supply stable or crypto asset [01:12:00] | Earns [[earning_interest_on_crypto_assets | supply APY]] [00:19:00] and allows borrowing [01:21:00] | Cannot stake the asset for HND rewards [01:07:00]                 |
| **Earn HND rewards** | Supply asset AND stake h token [01:03:00] | Earns [[supply_apy_vs_stake_apr | stake APR]] in HND tokens [00:48:00]        | Cannot use the staked asset as collateral for a loan [01:07:00] |

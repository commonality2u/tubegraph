CAP Finance is described as a "degen low cap" protocol, but still considered a "real yield protocol" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It operates as a decentralized exchange for synthetic assets, currently supporting trading pairs for ETH and BTC with leverage up to 50x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## CAP Token Utility

Holders of the CAP token can stake it to earn a yield of approximately 11.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Investment Considerations for the CAP Token

Investing in the CAP token implies a bullish outlook on the protocol, with the idea that it could potentially become the "next GMX" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The protocol aims to build a "flywheel" by having no trading fees, which is intended to attract more traders, increase volume, and subsequently deepen liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

As of the recording, CAP Finance has a market capitalization of approximately $12.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. When comparing financial metrics, GMX has a Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of roughly 14.5, while CAP, based on current numbers and considering total revenue shares to holders, has a P/E ratio of about 9.87 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Users can verify these numbers on Token Terminal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Tokenomics and Governance

As of the current information, there is no governance mechanism for the CAP token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Therefore, acquiring the token is primarily for exposure to the protocol's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

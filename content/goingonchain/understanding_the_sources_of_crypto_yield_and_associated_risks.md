During volatile market periods and with rising interest rates, individuals may seek ways for their crypto assets to generate income to offset other expenses, such as mortgage interest [00:00:11]. However, navigating the landscape of crypto yield requires understanding its sources and inherent risks.

## Challenges with Centralized Finance (CeFi) Platforms

Recently, many centralized finance (CeFi) platforms have faced significant issues, including exposure to events like Terra's collapse or the struggles of Three Arrows Capital (3AC) [00:00:25]. These issues have led to withdrawal halts or even bankruptcy for some services [00:00:31]. As a result, some users have withdrawn their assets from platforms like Hodlnaut and Finblox [00:00:36]. While this mitigates risk, it also means the assets are no longer earning yield [00:00:44].

## Strategies for Earning Yield on Crypto Assets

Several methods exist to earn yield on crypto assets, each with varying levels of risk and potential return.

### Earning Yield through Crypto Exchanges

Many crypto exchanges offer services that allow users to earn interest on their holdings.

*   **KuCoin:**
    *   **Lending:** Users can lend out their crypto assets for a specified term (e.g., seven or fourteen days) to earn interest [00:00:59].
    *   **KuCoin Earn:** This feature allows users to park stablecoins or Bitcoin to earn a stated APR. Tenures can be flexible or fixed [00:01:10].
*   **FTX App:**
    *   The FTX App provides a simplified interface for buying, selling, depositing, and withdrawing crypto [00:02:17]. Transfers of ERC-20 tokens from FTX Pro to the FTX App are free [00:02:32].
    *   **Interest Rates:** FTX offers a tiered interest rate structure. The first $10,000 held earns 8% APY, while subsequent amounts earn 5%, leading to an effective rate of 6.1% for balances exceeding $10,000 [00:02:59]. This yield applies to various assets, including USDC and Ethereum [00:03:15].
    *   **Withdrawals:** Users can withdraw up to $2,000 if they have not completed KYC verification [00:03:25]. Withdrawals can be made via international wire transfer to a foreign currency (USD) bank account or as USDC to a crypto wallet like MetaMask, with both options being free [00:03:34].

### Earning Yield through Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

Decentralized finance (DeFi) offers ways to earn yield directly on the blockchain.

*   **Liquid Staking:** Platforms like Lido and Rocket Pool allow users to stake Ethereum (ETH) and receive rewards, typically around 4% [00:01:33]. Running one's own node for staking can result in higher ETH rewards [00:01:42].

### Storing Assets in a Personal Wallet

The safest approach, though it yields no direct return, is to store crypto assets in a personal wallet, retaining full control of the private keys ("your keys, your coin") [00:01:47]. In this scenario, any gains come solely from asset price appreciation [00:01:52].

## Understanding the Sources of Yield

The exact sources of yield on platforms like FTX are not always transparent, with no fixed answers readily available [00:04:11]. However, potential explanations include:

*   **Lending to the Platform:** The platform may use deposited assets for its own margin trading and lending operations [00:04:32].
*   **Liquidity for Lending/Borrowing Pools:** Assets could serve as liquidity for lending and borrowing services offered on related platforms, such as FTX Pro [00:04:41].
*   **Marketing Strategy:** The attractive yield rates could be a marketing tool to incentivize users to use the FTX App [00:04:53].

## Associated Risks and Risk Management

Earning yield on crypto assets is **not risk-free** [00:03:59].

*   **Platform Risk:** A primary concern is "platform risk." If a centralized platform like FTX experiences a failure or halts withdrawals, assets stored on the platform could be lost [00:04:03].
*   **Prudent Risk Management:** To mitigate these risks, it is advisable to practice prudent risk management, which includes diversifying assets across different platforms and yield-earning strategies [00:05:11]. This approach aims to ensure that at least some assets continue to earn yield while managing overall exposure [00:05:14].

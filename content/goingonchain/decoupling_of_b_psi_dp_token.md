From: [[goingonchain]] <br/> 

The B PSI DP token serves as a receipt token for deposits made into the Nexus protocol's liquid Pylon pool on Terra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. When users deposit [[ust_and_b_psi_dp_tokens | UST]] into this 24-month locked pool, they receive Nexus tokens as rewards, with a stated APR of approximately 15.73% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Unlike regular Pylon pools, the liquid Pylon pool issues B PSI DP tokens as a tradable receipt for the deposited [[ust_and_b_psi_dp_tokens | UST]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This token can be exchanged for [[ust_and_b_psi_dp_tokens | UST]] on platforms like TerraSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Observed De-peg

The B PSI DP token has experienced a de-peg from its intended 1:1 value with deposited [[ust_and_b_psi_dp_tokens | UST]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. While the underlying deposit behaves like a bond, guaranteeing the return of the initial [[ust_and_b_psi_dp_tokens | UST]] after 24 months, the market value of B PSI DP has diverged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

An example illustrates this discrepancy: a user deposited 100 [[ust_and_b_psi_dp_tokens | UST]] and received B PSI DP tokens representing 128.82 [[ust_and_b_psi_dp_tokens | UST]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The Pylon protocol recorded the deposited amount as 128.973 [[ust_and_b_psi_dp_tokens | UST]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This indicates an ongoing de-peg of approximately 28% to 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Arbitrage Opportunity

This de-peg presents a potential arbitrage opportunity, though it requires a long-term bullish outlook on the Nexus token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

Two main approaches can be considered:
1.  **Waiting for Re-peg:** One strategy involves purchasing the de-pegged B PSI DP tokens and waiting for their value to return closer to par with [[ust_and_b_psi_dp_tokens | UST]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This relies on the market correcting the current discrepancy.
2.  **Long-Term Hold:** If the de-peg persists or worsens, the holder can wait the full 24-month lock-up period. At the end of this period, the initial [[ust_and_b_psi_dp_tokens | UST]] deposited will be returned, along with accumulated Nexus token rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. For example, a purchase of B PSI DP representing 128 [[ust_and_b_psi_dp_tokens | UST]] for only 100 [[ust_and_b_psi_dp_tokens | UST]] would yield 128 [[ust_and_b_psi_dp_tokens | UST]] back after 24 months, in addition to Nexus token rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

However, a 24-month waiting period is considered a very long time in the crypto market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Potential Causes for De-peg

The current bearish market conditions are hypothesized to be a reason for this discrepancy, as participants may be selling their B PSI DP tokens, creating the observed de-peg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

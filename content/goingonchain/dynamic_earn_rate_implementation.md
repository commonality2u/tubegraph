The previously stable 19.5% interest rate offered by Anchor is expected to decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This change follows the recent passing of a new vote, which will make the earn rate dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The primary goal of this adjustment is to ensure the long-term sustainability of Anchor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## How the Dynamic Rate Works

The adjustment to the interest rate will depend on a specific formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>:
*   If the yield reserve increases by 5%, the interest rate will increase by 1.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   If the yield reserve drops by 5%, the interest rate will decrease by 1.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

These interest rate adjustments will occur on a monthly basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Current Trends and Future Outlook

Over the past 30 days, Anchor's yield reserve has shown a downward trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This decline is attributed to a higher number of users depositing funds compared to those borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

To address this imbalance and improve the yield reserve, Anchor plans to integrate more collateral options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Recently, Avax was added as collateral, enabling Avax users to borrow UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. However, the process of adding new collateral is time-consuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

Given the current situation, it is anticipated that Anchor's interest rate will start to decline in the coming months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## User Strategy

Despite the expected decrease, one strategy is to continue using Anchor for the time being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Even if the interest rate drops to 1.5% per month, it is still likely to be significantly higher than rates offered by traditional local banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Additionally, adopting a "wait and see" approach and exploring other options for [[earning_interest_on_stablecoins | earning interest on stablecoins]] is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

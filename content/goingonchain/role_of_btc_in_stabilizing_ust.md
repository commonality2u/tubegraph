The downfall of Luna was attributed to several factors, including a [[coordinated_attack_on_stablecoins | coordinated attack]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Attackers acquired 1 billion UST and loaned it for 3 billion BTC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Their subsequent sale of this BTC triggered a bank run on Anchor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, causing UST to de-peg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Initial Strategy

The Terra [[USDB Stablecoin Mechanism | UST mechanism]] dictates that selling UST results in the minting of Luna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This means increased UST selling leads to a higher supply of Luna, creating a "dead loop" or "vicious cycle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

The Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) held a reserve of BTC specifically to stabilize UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Their strategy involved continuously selling this BTC to maintain UST's peg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Challenges and Consequences

Despite these efforts, the stabilization strategy did not work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The continuous sale of BTC by LFG contributed to a broader market panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This was exacerbated by negative macroeconomic data, high inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, and calls for regulation on stablecoins from the Treasury Secretary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

The de-pegging of UST led to Luna's price dropping to less than 10 cents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Terra's ongoing response prioritized restoring the UST peg over Luna's price, continuing to burn UST (which mints more Luna) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This action further depressed Luna's price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The large sell-off also impacted Bitcoin, causing its price to continue to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, and even led to [[USDT Tron scam explanation | USDT]] briefly losing its peg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

Investing in NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) can extend beyond simple trading to generating passive income through various mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Key considerations include the utility of associated tokens, project mechanics, and inherent market [[risks_and_considerations_in_defi_investments | risks]].

## Passive Income Generating NFTs

Several NFT projects are designed to provide ongoing returns to their holders:

### CyberKongz
Considered an "OG" for passive income in the NFT space, CyberKongz launched with 1,000 NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.
*   **Floor Price**: As of the recording, the floor price was 155 ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   **Income Mechanism**: Owning a CyberKong allows holders to earn 10 "Bananas" per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. One Banana was valued at $75, equating to $750 daily passive income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Banana Utility**: The market for Bananas exists due to their utility within the CyberKongz ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Bananas are required to:
    *   Set a biography for a CyberKong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
    *   Rename a CyberKong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
    *   Breed "Baby Kongz" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Bear Deluxe
Bear Deluxe NFTs are another example of passive income generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Floor Price**: The floor price was 2.55 ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Supply**: There is a total supply of 6,900 Bear Deluxe NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Income Mechanism**: Each Bear earns one "Jug of Honey" per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Honey Utility**: While the price of Honey was not yet established, it offers "crazy stuff" utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, such as:
    *   Combining with a beehive to transform into a "B Lightning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
    *   B Lightning NFTs can mint 0.13 Honey per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Trend**: This project exemplifies how NFTs are increasingly evolving into game-like assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Anonymice
Anonymice NFTs feature a unique breeding and staking mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Floor Price**: The floor price was approximately 9 ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Supply & Breeding**: Out of 10,000 initially minted mice, 6,450 have been "burned," leaving 3,550 "breedable" mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. These remaining mice are the only ones capable of breeding new mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Income Mechanism (Staking)**: To earn "Cheese," users must stake their mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. One staked mouse yields one Cheese, with a maximum of 10 mice stakeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Cheese Acquisition**: Cheese can also be purchased via UniSwap or private sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Cheese Utility (Breeding)**: Cheese is used to breed new mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Breeding requires two mice and Cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Breeding Limitations**: Key considerations for breeding include:
    *   The two parent mice are "burned" in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
    *   The newly produced mouse cannot be bred further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Key Considerations and [[risks_and_considerations_in_defi_investments | Risks]]

When considering [[investing_in_cryptocurrency | NFT investments]] for passive income, it's crucial to understand the underlying mechanics and potential pitfalls:

*   **Token Utility**: The viability of the passive income stream is dependent on the utility and demand for the associated tokens (e.g., Bananas, Honey, Cheese) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Market Dynamics**: There is a risk that these "farming tokens" could be subject to price dumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **[[cryptocurrency_investment_approach | Due Diligence]]**: It is paramount to conduct your own [[key_takeaways_and_lessons_learned_in_crypto_investing | research]] before investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

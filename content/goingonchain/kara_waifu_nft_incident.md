The Kara Waifu project launched on "Nowhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. One day, the project performed a [[rug_pulls_in_nft_space | rug pull]], and all of their social media accounts were subsequently deleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. It was also highlighted that their drawings were copied from other projects on different chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. As of the time of the discussion, the Kara Waifu project is no longer active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Cidadao is a platform that integrates [[how_blockchain_works_in_cryptocurrency | blockchain]] technology with real estate, uniquely backed by physical assets unlike many other DeFi projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## The [[iro_introducing_real_estate_on_chain_process | Introducing Real Estate On Chain (IRO)]] Process

The platform seeks commercial building owners interested in bringing their properties on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This is done through a process called [[iro_introducing_real_estate_on_chain_process | Introducing Real Estate On Chain (IRO)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

### How an IRO Works
An [[iro_introducing_real_estate_on_chain_process | IRO]] requires participants to commit a minimum sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. If the minimum sum is met and the [[iro_introducing_real_estate_on_chain_process | IRO]] is successful, tokens and rewards are distributed to participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. If the sum is not met, funds are refunded to participants, and the property is not brought on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

The [[iro_introducing_real_estate_on_chain_process | IRO]] duration is typically 10 days, during which participants can commit USDC into a pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Detailed property information, including fair value, stable income, and rental income, is provided on a dedicated page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### IRO Values and Rewards
For a property like the Cardiff Building, the [[iro_introducing_real_estate_on_chain_process | IRO]] value that needs to be met is approximately $21 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, with an [[iro_introducing_real_estate_on_chain_process | IRO]] reward of about $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

Rewards are calculated based on the daily reward and individual contribution. For example, if the daily reward is $1000 and a participant commits $1000 on day one without other commitments, they receive 100% of that day's reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. However, if another participant commits $9000 on day two, the original participant's share of the reward reduces to 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

The project offers [[iro_introducing_real_estate_on_chain_process | IRO]] rewards to participants and supporters instead of paying third-party agent fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Once committed, funds cannot be withdrawn until the [[iro_introducing_real_estate_on_chain_process | IRO]] is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Tokenization and Governance

If an [[iro_introducing_real_estate_on_chain_process | IRO]] passes, committed USDC is swapped for [[real_estate_token_ret_and_governance_token_knight | Real Estate Token (RET)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### [[real_estate_token_ret_and_governance_token_knight | Real Estate Token (RET)]]
The [[real_estate_token_ret_and_governance_token_knight | RET]] can be sold on decentralized exchanges like UniSwap or used to earn [[real_estate_token_ret_and_governance_token_knight | Knight]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### [[real_estate_token_ret_and_governance_token_knight | Knight]] Governance Token
[[real_estate_token_ret_and_governance_token_knight | Knight]] is Cidadao's governance token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The platform collects 2% of all properties listed on it, so owning [[real_estate_token_ret_and_governance_token_knight | Knight]] provides exposure to other properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Workflow Summary
The full workflow of the [[iro_introducing_real_estate_on_chain_process | IRO]] process involves a 10-day commitment period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. If successful, participants receive their [[real_estate_token_ret_and_governance_token_knight | RET]] tokens and rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. If unsuccessful, the committed funds are refunded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. The project is considered interesting due to its physical asset backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

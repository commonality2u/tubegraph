Traditional bribes are often "under the table" and involve incentives for actions not meant to be caught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, **crypto bribes** are distinct because they are open and transparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. In the context of [[Decentralized finance options and liquid staking | decentralized finance]], a protocol might openly offer a share of a "bribe" (e.g., 100k of FBEATS) to a token holder in exchange for their vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## How Crypto Bribes Change Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)

Historically, [[Stakeholders in decentralized exchanges | liquidity pool providers]] (LPs) and stakers would "farm" for DEX tokens, and LPs were often ready to dump these tokens at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The introduction of crypto bribes has fundamentally shifted this dynamic for DEXs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

Instead of merely distributing tokens, DEXs now announce that a portion of their emissions (e.g., 30% of BEATS emission) will be distributed based on votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The protocol that receives the highest number of votes gets the largest share of these emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Impact on Protocols
Protocols actively compete for votes to increase their DEX token rewards for their specific pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This, in turn, attracts more [[Stakeholders in decentralized exchanges | liquidity providers]] to their pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Participants might also buy a protocol's tokens to chase high Annual Percentage Rates (APRs), which can help push up the price of that protocol's token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

Originally, protocols might buy DEX tokens to add buying pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. However, this isn't sustainable as it pushes the DEX token price up too much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This is where crypto bribes become crucial: protocols offer incentives (e.g., 100k VIS) to DEX token holders to vote for their protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This attracts votes even from those not directly in the protocol's liquidity pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Impact on Liquidity Providers (LPs) and Stakers
With crypto bribes, [[Stakeholders in decentralized exchanges | liquidity providers]] are less willing to sell their DEX tokens because they need them to vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. LPs typically vote for their own pools to help them secure a larger share of emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Similarly, stakers, who already hold DEX tokens, now have an incentive to use them for voting to earn more yield rather than selling them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Aligned Incentives and Benefits
[[Impact of Crypto Bribes on DEX Token Value | Crypto bribes]] help align the incentives for all [[Stakeholders in decentralized exchanges | stakeholders]] in the DeFi ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>:
*   **LPs and Stakers**: Have a reason to hold DEX tokens and vote for their pools, increasing [[Yield optimization and decentralized finance DeFi | yield]] and earning from bribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Traders**: Benefit from low slippage and high liquidity in DEXs, leading to more trading fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Protocols**: Benefit from high liquidity in their pools and encourage participants to buy their native tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **DEX Tokens**: Experience increased buying pressure as holders seek to acquire more tokens for voting and participating in bribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

This system creates a positive feedback loop, moving DEX tokens beyond being mere "farming tokens" that are immediately dumped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Case Study: BEATS
Before January of a specific year, BEATS tokens were frequently subject to selling pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. However, from January 6th, BEATS began offering bribes, allocating 30% of their emissions based on votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This led to increased voting activity and demand for BEATS tokens, creating sustained buying pressure as holders recognized the benefits of the bribe system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. While selling pressure isn't entirely eliminated, the buying pressure becomes strong enough to counteract it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Investment Considerations
Beyond BEATS, another DEX employing crypto bribes is SpiritSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. For example, Greater DAO has engaged in bribe offerings with SpiritSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

When considering investments in DEX tokens, it's advisable to look for incentive structures like crypto bribes where all [[Stakeholders in decentralized exchanges | stakeholders]]' interests are aligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This indicates a robust and sustainable model for the DEX token's [[Impact of Crypto Bribes on DEX Token Value | value]] and its ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

The trend of increasing options trading volume observed in the stock market is now being witnessed in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Stock Market Precedent
In the stock market, there has been a noticeable trend towards options trading, with a significant increase in volume, particularly among retail investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. A major factor contributing to this growth is the availability of platforms like [[platforms_offering_crypto_options | Robinhood]], which enable easy access to these financial products for a broad audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Parallel in Crypto
This shift is now coming to the crypto market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Projects such as Ribbon Finance (offering Ethereum and AVAX options) and Dopex (offering FTM and MATIC options) are beginning to attract significant Total Value Locked (TVL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Ribbon Finance, for instance, leads the crypto options sector with a TVL close to $300 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. While this figure is currently small compared to the broader DeFi market, platforms like Ribbon Finance and Lyra are showing [[crypto_options_growth | significant growth potential]] in their TVL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

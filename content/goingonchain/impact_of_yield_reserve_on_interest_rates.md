Previously, a high 19.5% interest rate was offered on Anchor Protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06"></a>. This "good time" is not expected to last, as the interest rate is projected to start coming down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03"></a>. Users of Anchor should take note of these upcoming changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10"></a>.

## Dynamic Earn Rate Implementation

A new vote has passed, making the earn rate (interest) on Anchor dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13"></a>. The primary reason for this change is to make Anchor [[yield_optimization_and_decentralized_finance_defi | sustainable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20"></a>.

The adjustment in interest rates depends on a specific formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26"></a>:
*   If the [[decentralized_finance_and_yield_reserves | yield reserve]] increases by 5%, the interest rate will increase by 1.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30"></a>.
*   If the [[decentralized_finance_and_yield_reserves | yield reserve]] drops by 5%, the interest rate will drop by 1.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35"></a>.
These adjustments are set to occur monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42"></a>.

## Current Yield Reserve Trend and Implications

Over the past 30 days, the [[decentralized_finance_and_yield_reserves | yield reserve]] has been on a downward trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46"></a>. This decline is attributed to more people [[supplying_assets_for_yield | depositing]] assets than borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52"></a>. This imbalance suggests that the interest rate for Anchor will likely start decreasing in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26"></a>.

## Strategies to Improve the Gap

To address the imbalance between deposits and borrows, Anchor is planning to add more collateral options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02"></a>. This would allow more people to borrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05"></a>. Recently, Avalanche (AVAX) was added as collateral, enabling AVAX users to borrow UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10"></a>. However, adding new collateral types is a gradual process and takes time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17"></a>.

## Future Outlook

Due to the time required to add more collateral, it is anticipated that Anchor's interest rate will likely start coming down in the next few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31"></a>. Despite the expected decrease, the interest rate, even at 1.5% per month, is still projected to be higher than what traditional local banks offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39"></a>.

The speaker's personal strategy is to continue using Anchor while also adopting a "wait and see" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50"></a>, and to start exploring other [[comparison_of_yield_farming_on_stablecoin_platforms | stablecoin]] yield opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52"></a>. This reflects [[lessons_from_high_apy_yield_farming | lessons from high APY yield farming]] where initial high rates often normalize.

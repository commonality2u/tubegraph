Do Kwon introduced a new plan for Terra, featuring a hard fork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This plan involves renaming the existing Luna to [[luna_classic_and_new_luna_token_airdrop | Luna Classic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, while the new Terra chain will be called [[luna_classic_and_new_luna_token_airdrop | Luna]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> and will operate without a stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## New Luna Airdrop

The [[luna_classic_and_new_luna_token_airdrop | new Luna]] tokens are planned to be [[luna_classic_and_new_luna_token_airdrop | airdropped]] to several groups:
*   [[luna_classic_and_new_luna_token_airdrop | Luna Classic]] holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   Stakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>
*   [[ust_mechanism_and_its_impact_on_luna | UST]] holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>
*   App developers, who are considered crucial for the new chain's viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

For instance, 25% of the new Luna tokens are allocated to [[ust_mechanism_and_its_impact_on_luna | UST]] holders at launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The launch date and time provided were May 27th, around 4 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. However, most of these [[luna_classic_and_new_luna_token_airdrop | airdrops]] are vested; for example, [[ust_mechanism_and_its_impact_on_luna | UST]] holders initially receive only 10% at unlock, with the remaining 90% vested over two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Luna Guard Foundation (LFG) Reserves

The Luna Guard Foundation (LFG) released details of their remaining reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, which total approximately $300 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. These remaining assets are intended to compensate remaining [[ust_mechanism_and_its_impact_on_luna | UST]] users, starting with the smallest holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Concerns have been raised about how the LFG handled their Bitcoin reserves, suggesting that the Bitcoin could have been used to compensate [[ust_mechanism_and_its_impact_on_luna | UST]] holders directly rather than attempting to support the [[ust_mechanism_and_its_impact_on_luna | UST]] market, which might have allowed large holders to exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Criticisms and Challenges

The hard fork essentially creates another chain, but without the stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. A major concern is the potential lack of developers building on the new chain, which could render it worthless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Several blockchain projects, including Polygon, Juno, and Phantom, are actively attempting to attract Terra's former project developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Another challenge is the eroded trust in Do Kwon and his team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Terra's UI/UX Strength

Despite these challenges, Terra's user interface and user experience (UI/UX) are highlighted as a significant strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The experience of using the [[using_terra_wallet_for_staking_operations | Terra wallet]] is considered superior to that of MetaMask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. If this user experience can be replicated on another chain, it could be a major advantage for that platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

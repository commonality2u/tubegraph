## Understanding Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)
A [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | Decentralized Exchange]] (DEX) is a platform like PancakeSwap or SushiSwap where users can trade their tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Beyond trading, users can also become [[role_of_liquidity_providers_and_stakers_in_dex_token_systems | liquidity providers]] to earn a portion of the trading fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

### Utility of DEX Tokens
The typical [[utility_of_dex_tokens | utilities of DEX tokens]] include:
*   **Governance Power** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   **Staking for Yield** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>
*   **Participation in Launchpads** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>

## Stakeholders in a DEX
Several key participants interact within a DEX ecosystem:

### Traders
[[role_of_traders_and_protocols_in_dex | Traders]] utilize DEXs to trade a variety of protocol tokens, seeking low slippage and good liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The DEX earns a cut of the trading fees from these transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### Protocols
[[role_of_traders_and_protocols_in_dex | Protocols]] look for DEXs with high liquidity to set up their pools, similar to how companies choose exchanges with more liquidity for listings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### Liquidity Providers (LPs)
[[role_of_liquidity_providers_and_stakers_in_dex_token_systems | Liquidity providers]] contribute to the high liquidity that protocols seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. By providing liquidity, LPs earn a cut of the fees and often receive additional incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. For a protocol, this can be a win as it might require users to buy their token to participate in security pools, thereby improving liquidity for the DEX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Stakers
[[role_of_liquidity_providers_and_stakers_in_dex_token_systems | Stakers]] acquire DEX tokens either from the open market or by farming them, and then stake these tokens to earn more yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. For example, holding CAKE tokens allows participation in Initial Farm Offerings (IFOs) or staking for additional yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Stakers also have the potential to earn more DEX tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Why Holding DEX Tokens Can Be Risky

The primary challenge with holding DEX tokens arises from the incentives provided to [[role_of_liquidity_providers_and_stakers_in_dex_token_systems | liquidity providers]] and [[role_of_liquidity_providers_and_stakers_in_dex_token_systems | stakers]]. Both parties are often farming DEX tokens as a form of "extrinsic incentives," especially if they are not buying the tokens from the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

This misalignment of incentives leads to a critical vulnerability:
> When the market enters a state of fear, these participants are likely to be the first to dump their DEX tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

This behavior can result in significant price drops for DEX tokens like CAKE and SUSHI during market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Therefore, some investors choose to farm DEX tokens rather than buy them outright because the incentives are not aligned for long-term holding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

However, the landscape for DEX tokens is evolving, with more individuals becoming willing to hold them due to emerging factors such as [[impact_of_crypto_bribes_on_decentralized_exchange_dex_tokens | crypto bribes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

Investing in [[types_of_stablecoins | stablecoins]] often involves seeking attractive interest rates, such as the 19.5% offered by Anchor Protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, these rates are not always static and can prompt investors to consider diversification.

## Reasons for Diversification

The interest rate on Anchor Protocol, a platform for [[using_stablecoins_in_yield_farming | using stablecoins in yield farming]], is becoming dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This change was implemented following a vote to ensure the platform's sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The interest rate adjusts based on a formula: if the yield reserve increases by 5%, the interest rate goes up by 1.5%, and if it drops by 5%, the interest rate decreases by 1.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. These adjustments occur monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

The yield reserve has shown a downward trend, indicating more deposits than borrowings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. While Anchor plans to add more collateral, such as AVAX, to encourage borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, this process takes time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Consequently, the interest rate for Anchor is expected to decline in the coming months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Strategy for Diversification

Given the anticipated reduction in Anchor Protocol's interest rates, even if they remain higher than traditional bank offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, it is advisable to:
*   Continue monitoring the situation ("wait and see approach") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   Start exploring other [[types_of_stablecoins | stablecoin]] use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

[[introduction_to_cryptocurrency_lending_platforms | Crypto lending platforms]] operate similarly to peer-to-peer (P2P) lending models, where users can act as either lenders or borrowers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. As a lender, you deposit cryptocurrency and earn interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. As a borrower, you can deposit crypto as collateral to obtain a loan, and your crypto is returned upon repayment of the loan and interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

This article examines the interest rates and fees associated with three prominent [[using_centralized_exchanges_for_crypto_lending | centralized crypto lending platforms]]: BlockFi, Celsius Network, and Hodlnaut.

## BlockFi

BlockFi is a well-known platform that is regulated in the U.S <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

*   **Interest Payouts**: Interest is paid out every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Earning Interest with Stablecoins

If you have cryptocurrency on hand, you might consider lending it out to [[earning_interest_on_crypto_assets | earn interest]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:04">[02:47:04]</a>. For those without existing crypto, purchasing stablecoins like USDT or USDC is an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to and backed by the U.S. dollar, functioning similarly to buying U.S. dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. The interest rates offered on these stablecoins are considerably more attractive than those provided by traditional banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

## Risks

It is important to consider the risks involved with [[advantages_and_disadvantages_of_using_crypto_lending_platforms | crypto lending platforms]]. For example, if a platform like Celsius Network were to fail, any funds held on it would also be at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

BenDAO, a lending and borrowing platform for NFTs, faces significant challenges due to its high utilization rate, which currently stands at approximately 95% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. This high rate indicates that most of the deposited assets are currently being borrowed, leading to various issues for both lenders and potential bidders on liquidated NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

## Impact on Lenders
One primary problem stemming from the high utilization rate is that lenders may be unable to withdraw their deposited ETH when they need it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. This illiquidity can create a significant risk for those who provide ETH to the platform.

## Impact on Bidders
The high utilization rate also affects the bidding process for liquidating NFTs. When users place a bid on a liquidating NFT, they are required to lock up their ETH for 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. This lock-up period, combined with the general illiquidity caused by high utilization, deters potential bidders, leading to fewer people participating in bids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

BenDAO aims to provide liquidity for NFT holders but must address these challenges to ensure the platform's smooth operation and attract more participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

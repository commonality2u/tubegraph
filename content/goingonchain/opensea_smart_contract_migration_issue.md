[[opensea_phishing_attack_on_nft_users | Opensea]] users have been impacted by a [[opensea_phishing_attack_on_nft_users | phishing attack]] related to a new [[smart_contract_wallets_and_their_features | smart contract]] migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This incident has led to a number of users losing their NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## The Phishing Attack
A [[opensea_phishing_attack_on_nft_users | phishing attack]] on [[opensea_phishing_attack_on_nft_users | Opensea]] has resulted in 17 users accidentally falling victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Trackers of the hacker's wallet indicate that the stolen ETH has already been sent to Tornado Cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Tornado Cash functions as a "washing machine" where crypto deposits become untraceable upon withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The situation is currently under investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Reason for Smart Contract Migration
The issue originated when [[opensea_phishing_attack_on_nft_users | Opensea]] released a new [[smart_contract_wallets_and_their_features | smart contract]] and requested users to migrate their listings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The purpose of this contract is to upgrade and delete inactive NFTs on Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This upgrade was deemed necessary because users had previously lost NFTs due to inactive listings being exploited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Opensea's Communication
[[opensea_phishing_attack_on_nft_users | Opensea]] shared the link to the new contract on their Twitter channel and also sent out an email about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. It is speculated that the hacker exploited this migration process to phish users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Some users have also raised concerns, sharing that the [[opensea_phishing_attack_on_nft_users | Opensea]] contract itself might contain a flaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## User Recommendations
To enhance security, users may consider revoking their approvals to [[opensea_phishing_attack_on_nft_users | Opensea]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This can be done by navigating to Dbank and selecting "approval" to view and [[how_to_revoke_opensea_contract_approvals | revoke Opensea's access]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Important Considerations:
*   Revoking a contract approval incurs [[network_fees_associated_with_smart_contract_wallets | gas fees]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   Users should be aware of the current [[network_fees_associated_with_smart_contract_wallets | gas price]] on Ethereum when performing this action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

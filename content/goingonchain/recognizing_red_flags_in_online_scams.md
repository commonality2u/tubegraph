Understanding common [[crypto_scam_awareness | crypto scam awareness]] and recognizing [[psychological_tricks_used_in_scams | psychological tricks used in scams]] can help individuals avoid falling victim to online scams, particularly those involving [[BNB cryptocurrency scams | BNB cryptocurrency scams]] and other digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Common Red Flags

Several indicators can signal a fraudulent scheme:

### Unrealistic Promises
Scams often promise significant returns with minimal effort, such as a bot that can "front run" transactions in PancakeSwap to yield substantial BNB profits (e.g., 10 BNB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

### Requests for Additional Funds
A common tactic involves asking for a small initial investment, then, after the promised outcome fails to materialize, making "lame excuses" and demanding more funds to "trigger" the desired result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This exploits a victim's desire to recover their initial capital and achieve the promised gains, making them willing to invest more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### [[social_media_tactics_in_scams | Social Media Tactics in Scams]]
Suspicious social media presence is a major red flag:
*   **Disproportionate Content:** A channel with a large follower count (e.g., 12,000) that has very little content (e.g., only one video) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **Uniformly Positive Comments:** Comments that are "all too good to be true," entirely positive, and lack any negative feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Technical Red Flags
When dealing with code or software, consider the following:
*   **Unverified Wallet Calls:** If provided code triggers a call to an unknown or unverified wallet, this is a significant risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Blind Copy-Pasting:** Avoid blindly copying and pasting code, especially if you do not understand its function or where it sends funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

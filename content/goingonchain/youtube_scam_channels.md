YouTube channels can be used by scammers to promote fraudulent schemes, often leveraging promises of high returns in cryptocurrency. One common example involves promoting fake bots for front-running transactions on decentralized exchanges like PancakeSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## How the Scam Works

A scam YouTube channel may promise that by following a specific script, users can create a bot capable of "front-running" transactions on PancakeSwap, guaranteeing profits, such as 10 BNB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

1.  **Initial Deception**: The channel might appear legitimate, potentially boasting a significant follower count (e.g., 12,000 followers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a> and an abundance of positive comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
2.  **Engagement**: Interested individuals may reach out to the scammers, often via platforms like Discord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
3.  **Initial Investment**: Victims are persuaded to test the bot with a small amount of cryptocurrency, such as BNB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
4.  **Bot Failure and Excuse**: The bot inevitably fails to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The scammer then provides a lame excuse, such as claiming insufficient capital was invested to trigger the front-running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
5.  **Request for More Funds**: The scammer then pressures the victim to deposit more funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## [[common_cryptocurrency_scam_tactics | Recognizing Red Flags]]

Several red flags can indicate a scam, helping users with [[crypto_scam_awareness | crypto scam awareness]]:

*   **Channel Inconsistencies**: A channel with a large follower count (e.g., 2,000 followers) but only one video is highly suspicious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Unnaturally Positive Comments**: Comments that are "too good to be true," exclusively positive, and lack any negative feedback are a major warning sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Malicious Code**: The provided code for the bot often includes a hidden function that directs funds to a scammer's wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. It is crucial never to blindly copy and paste code without understanding where it sends money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

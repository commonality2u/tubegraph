On 27 September 2001 (likely 2021), Binance announced that all users in Singapore would no longer have service for fiat deposits and withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This announcement gave users approximately one month to [[withdrawal_of_assets_deadline | withdraw assets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Affected Services

Following the announcement, several key services became unavailable for Singaporean users:
*   **Fiat Deposits and Withdrawals** DBS Remit will no longer function for these transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   **Spot Trading** This service is no longer available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Liquid Swap** This feature is also no longer supported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Users were instructed to exit all their assets by 26 October 1921 (likely 2021) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Clarifications and Recommendations

Despite the general announcement, some specific scenarios required clarification:

*   **Staked Assets** There was initial confusion regarding whether staked assets, such as Cake, could still be withdrawn after the 26 October 2021 deadline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Customer Service indicated that withdrawals for staked assets would still be possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. However, for those concerned, it was advised to move coins to Trust Wallet or Metamask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Futures Trading** Futures trading was clarified as a different service and was not affected by these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

These insights and clarifications largely stemmed from community group discussions and questions posed to Binance Customer Service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

[[SnowdogDAO and its structure | SnowdogDAO]] emerged as a "very degen" play in the cryptocurrency space, quickly gaining attention due to its extremely high Annual Percentage Yield (APY), reminiscent of how [[staking_on_snowbank | Snowbank]] initially launched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. While the team behind SnowdogDAO utilizes elements of the [[olympus_dao_forks | OlympusDAO fork]] method to raise capital, it introduces significant differences, primarily designed to transition into a meme coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Key Differences from Typical OlympusDAO Forks

Unlike a standard [[olympus_dao_forks | OlympusDAO fork]], SnowdogDAO operates on a distinct, time-limited mechanism leading to a different outcome for its token, S-Dog.

### Vesting Period
*   **SnowdogDAO**: The vesting period for minted S-Dog tokens is 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Typical OlympusDAO Forks (e.g., Wonderland)**: Vesting typically takes 5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Project Duration and Phases
SnowdogDAO is structured to last for a specific 8-day period, after which its functionality and tokenomics significantly change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

*   **Days 1 to 5 (Minting Phase)**:
    *   Users can mint S-Dog tokens, similar to an [[olympus_dao_forks | Olympus DAO]] model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
    *   The total supply of S-Dog increases during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Days 5 to 8 (Transition Phase)**:
    *   Minting of S-Dog tokens ceases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
    *   Users can still redeem previously minted tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Day 8 (Conversion and Meme Coin Launch)**:
    *   The price of S-Dog is expected to become extremely volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
    *   All assets held by the DAO (excluding the liquidity pool) are converted into MIM (Magic Internet Money), a stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
    *   This MIM is then used to buy S-Dog from the S-Dog/MIM liquidity pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
    *   The S-Dog tokens acquired are subsequently burned, leading to a reduction in supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
    *   Staking rewards for S-Dog are paused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
    *   After Day 8, S-Dog transitions into a meme token with a fixed supply, intended to become the main currency for "Avec" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Project Outcome
*   **SnowdogDAO**: Designed to culminate in a meme token with a fixed supply after an 8-day event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Typical OlympusDAO Forks**: Aim to establish a decentralized reserve currency with continuous bonding and staking mechanisms.

## Project Risks

[[SnowdogDAO and its structure | SnowdogDAO]] carries significant risks, similar to other high-APY, anonymous projects:
*   **Anonymous Team**: The team behind SnowdogDAO is the same as [[staking_on_snowbank | Snowbank]] and remains anonymous, raising concerns about potential rug pulls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Unsustainable APY**: The initial very high APY is not sustainable long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **Time-Sensitive Nature**: As an 8-day event culminating in a meme coin, it requires a "fast in, fast out" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **New and Untypical Model**: It deviates from the established [[olympus_dao_forks | OlympusDAO fork]] model, making its long-term trajectory less predictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

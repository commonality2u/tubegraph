[[Anchor Protocol and bLuna Loans | Anchor Protocol]] is a decentralized finance platform designed for peer-to-peer lending and borrowing [00:00:15]. It aims to provide a high, stable yield for lenders and offers borrowing against crypto collateral [00:00:19].

## How it Works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>

*   **Lenders (Alice)**: Users can deposit money and earn an interest rate, which has been observed to be around 19% to 20% APR [00:00:05]. The initial interest rate for depositors was about 19.53% [00:00:05].
*   **Borrowers (Bob)**: Users can borrow money by staking their crypto as collateral [00:00:23]. Borrowers pay a floating interest rate and also receive ANC tokens as a reward for borrowing [000:00:27].

## Maintaining High Yield for Lenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>

The high yield offered to lenders by [[Anchor Protocol and bLuna Loans | Anchor Protocol]] is primarily sustained by two mechanisms:

1.  **Borrower Interest (Borrow APR)**: Borrowers pay an interest rate on the funds they borrow [00:00:38]. For instance, a borrower might pay approximately 21.55% APR [00:00:41]. If a borrower takes out $1,000, they would pay around $210 in interest over a year [00:00:43].
2.  **Staking Rewards from Collateral**: When borrowers stake their crypto as collateral (e.g., bLuna), these assets generate staking rewards [00:00:48]. The current staking reward return for collateral like bLuna is about 5.83% [00:00:53].

### Example Scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>

Consider a scenario where:
*   Bob wants to borrow $1,000 [00:00:56].
*   Bob uses $3,000 worth of bLuna as collateral [00:00:58].
*   Alice lends $1,000, expecting a 20% APR [00:01:01].

The revenue generated for [[Anchor Protocol and bLuna Loans | Anchor Protocol]] is calculated as follows:
*   **Borrower's Interest**: Bob pays 22% on the $1,000 borrowed, totaling $220 [00:01:06].
*   **Staking Reward**: The $3,000 collateral earns a 5% staking reward, totaling $150 ($3,000 * 0.05) [00:01:10].
*   **Total Collected**: The platform collects a total of $370 ($220 from interest + $150 from staking rewards) [00:01:13].

### Fund Distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>

From the $370 collected in the example:
*   $200 goes to Alice (the lender), fulfilling her 20% APR expectation on her $1,000 deposit [00:01:15].
*   The remaining $170 goes to the Anchor Yield Reserve [00:01:17].

This system demonstrates the power of decentralized finance [00:01:20].

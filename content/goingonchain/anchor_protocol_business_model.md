[[overview_of_cap_finance_protocol | Anchor Protocol]] is a platform that facilitates peer-to-peer lending and borrowing [00:00:15]. It aims to provide a high, stable yield on deposits, making it an attractive option for lenders [00:00:31].

## Core Mechanics

The protocol operates with two main parties: lenders (Alice) and borrowers (Bob) [00:00:18].

### For Lenders (Alice)
Lenders can deposit money and earn a high [[interest_rates_on_anchor_protocol | interest rate]], typically around 19% to 20% Annual Percentage Rate (APR) [00:00:19]. The perceived stability and high yield of these deposits often lead to initial skepticism from external observers, who might assume it's a scam [00:00:08].

### For Borrowers (Bob)
Borrowers use their crypto assets as [[role_of_collateral_in_anchor_protocol | collateral]] to borrow money [00:00:23]. They pay a floating [[interest_rates_on_anchor_protocol | interest rate]] on the borrowed amount [00:00:25]. Additionally, borrowers receive ANC tokens as a reward for borrowing [00:00:29].

## Maintaining the High Yield

The high yield for lenders on [[interest_rates_on_anchor_protocol | Anchor Protocol]] is maintained through two primary mechanisms:

1.  **Borrower Interest Payments**: Borrowers pay an interest rate on the money they borrow. For example, a borrow APR might be 21.55%, meaning a $1,000 loan would incur a $210 interest payment annually [00:00:37].
2.  **Staking Rewards from Collateral**: When borrowers put up their crypto as [[role_of_collateral_in_anchor_protocol | collateral]], that collateral is staked [00:00:48]. The protocol earns [[avax_collateral_and_borrowing_on_anchor | staking rewards]] from this collateral, which can be around 5.83% [00:00:52].

### Financial Flow Example

Consider an example where Alice lends $1,000, expecting a 20% APR, and Bob borrows $1,000 using $3,000 in bLuna as [[role_of_collateral_in_anchor_protocol | collateral]] [00:00:56]:

*   **Bob's Borrowing Cost**: Bob pays 22% interest on his $1,000 loan, totaling $220 [00:01:06].
*   **Collateral Staking Reward**: Bob's $3,000 [[role_of_collateral_in_anchor_protocol | collateral]] earns a 5% [[avax_collateral_and_borrowing_on_anchor | staking reward]], which is $150 [00:01:10].
*   **Total Collected Funds**: The total amount collected by the protocol from Bob's activities is $220 (borrow interest) + $150 (staking reward) = $370 [00:01:13].
*   **Distribution of Funds**:
    *   $200 goes to Alice (the lender's 20% APR on $1,000) [00:01:15].
    *   The remaining $170 is directed to the [[sustainability_of_anchor_platform | Anchor yield reserve]] [00:01:17].

This mechanism demonstrates the "power of decentralized finance," where multiple revenue streams contribute to a platform's operations and user returns [00:01:20].

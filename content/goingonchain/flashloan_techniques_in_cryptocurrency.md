Flash loans are a unique and powerful [[borrowing_against_crypto_assets | borrowing mechanism]] within the [[introduction_to_cryptocurrency | cryptocurrency]] space, allowing users to borrow large amounts of assets without providing any collateral, provided the loan is repaid within the same blockchain transaction [00:01:14]. This "atomic" nature means the entire process, from borrowing to repayment, must occur instantaneously within a single block [00:01:18].

## Mechanics of a Flash Loan
A flash loan enables users to borrow significant amounts of [[introduction_to_cryptocurrency | cryptocurrency]] with minimal cost [00:01:16]. The core principle is that the borrowed funds must be returned to the lender within the same transaction block [00:01:18]. If the repayment fails for any reason, the entire transaction is automatically reversed, as if it never happened, ensuring the lender's funds are safe. This mechanism opens up possibilities for [[leverage_strategies_on_defi_platforms | leverage strategies]] and arbitrage opportunities without requiring upfront capital.

## Case Study: Leveraging a Flash Loan for Acoin Token Claim
An anonymous user successfully leveraged a flash loan to claim Acoin tokens associated with Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFTs [00:00:26]. This strategy capitalized on the Acoin airdrop rules, which did not require a snapshot, meaning that as long as one owned a BAYC NFT, they could claim Acoin tokens once [00:00:16].

### The Acoin Airdrop Context
*   The BAYC token price was approximately $13 [00:00:04].
*   Holding a BAYC NFT entitled the holder to receive about 10,000 Acoin tokens [00:00:07].
*   At the time, 10,000 Acoin tokens were valued at roughly $130,000 [00:00:11].
*   The absence of a snapshot meant that ownership at the time of claiming, not at a specific past moment, determined eligibility [00:00:16]. This rule caused the BAYC floor price to increase [00:00:23].

### The Anonymous User's Strategy
The anonymous user identified a vault on NFTX containing five BAYC NFTs that had not yet claimed their Acoin tokens [00:00:31]. This NFTX vault operates similarly to Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), where buying a token representing the vault means owning parts of the underlying assets (in this case, the five BAYC NFTs) [00:00:37].

The steps taken by the user were as follows:
1.  **Acquire a BAYC NFT:** The user purchased a BAYC NFT from OpenSea for approximately $300,000 [00:01:06].
2.  **Initiate a Flash Loan:** This purchased BAYC was used as a "collector" to take a flash loan from the NFTX vault [00:01:10].
3.  **Borrow and Claim:** Within a single Ethereum transaction, the user:
    *   Borrowed the five BAYC NFTs from the vault [00:01:21].
    *   Used these borrowed NFTs to claim approximately 60,000 Acoin tokens (10,000 Acoin per BAYC x 5 BAYCs) [00:01:23].
    *   Immediately returned the borrowed five BAYC NFTs back to the vault [00:01:29].
    *   Sold the Acoin tokens that were claimed [00:01:40].
    *   Sold the original BAYC NFT that was purchased [00:01:37].

### Outcome
Through this sophisticated flash loan maneuver, the anonymous user profited by approximately $800,000 [00:01:44]. The action raised questions within the [[introduction_to_cryptocurrency | crypto]] community as to whether it constituted an "attack" or a clever "arbitrage" [00:01:47].

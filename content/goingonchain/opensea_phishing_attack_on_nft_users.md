A phishing attack targeting Opensea users has been identified, resulting in 17 individuals accidentally falling victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Trackers of the hacker's wallet reported that the stolen Ethereum (ETH) has been transferred to Tornado Cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

> [!INFO] Tornado Cash
> Tornado Cash is described as a "washing machine" for cryptocurrency, allowing users to deposit crypto that then comes out at an untraceable destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

The situation is currently under investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Origin of the Attack

This phishing incident began in the context of Opensea's smart contract migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Opensea required users to migrate their listings to a new contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The purpose of this contract upgrade was to delete inactive NFTs on Ethereum, as previous hacks had led to users losing NFTs due to these inactive listings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

Opensea shared the link to the new contract on its Twitter channel and also sent out an email about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. It is believed that the hacker exploited this situation, using it as an opportunity to phish users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Some users have also suggested that the [[opensea_smart_contract_migration_issue | Opensea contract]] itself may have a flaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

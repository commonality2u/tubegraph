Freelancers and independent contractors often face the challenge of ensuring fair payment for their services, a common pain point where they can be at the losing end due to client disagreements over standards or non-payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. While Web2 platforms like Upwork or Fiverr offer solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>, the Web3 space is exploring new approaches for managing freelance agreements and resolving disputes.

## Trust Treaty: A Web3 Solution

Trust Treaty is a Web3 [[escrow_services_in_web_3_for_freelancers | escrow service]] that functions as a refundable [[smart_contracts_in_freelance_agreements | smart contract]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>. It aims to address the challenges of remote work in the Web3 creator economy by providing a structured way to manage contracts between clients and service providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:06">[03:45:06]</a>.

### How Trust Treaty Contracts Work

A client, such as an NFT client, can create a contract on Trust Treaty, specifying the contract title, critical information on expectations from both sides, deadlines, and the agreed price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>. The price can be locked in USD, USDT, or USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:16">[01:30:16]</a>. Funds committed by the client are moved to a new wallet address secured by the platform, to which neither the client nor the service provider has direct access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:33">[01:54:33]</a>. Users are represented by wallet addresses, allowing for anonymity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:48">[02:06:48]</a>. Once the client signs the contract, a specific link is generated to be shared with the service provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. The service provider reviews the details and signs to make the contract effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

Upon completion of work, the service provider can request payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:07">[02:53:07]</a>. If the client finds everything in order, they can finalize the agreement, releasing the funds to the service provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:24">[02:58:24]</a>.

## Dispute Resolution Process

If issues arise, the client has the option to open a dispute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:44">[03:07:44]</a>. The dispute resolution process on Trust Treaty involves several steps:

*   **Evidence Submission**: Both the client and the service provider are given an opportunity to submit their evidence regarding the dispute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:48">[03:10:48]</a>.
*   **Dispute Agents**: Two independent dispute agents are assigned to analyze the situation and provide their assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:24">[03:18:24]</a>.
*   **Decision**:
    *   If both dispute agents agree on a resolution, their decision is final, and the funds are either sent to the service provider or refunded to the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:43">[03:29:43]</a>.
    *   If the dispute agents disagree, a manager intervenes to make the final decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:25">[03:36:25]</a>.

## Risks and Considerations

While Web3 platforms like Trust Treaty offer interesting solutions for freelance contracts, there are [[risks_and_considerations_in_using_web_3_platforms_for_freelancers | risks and considerations in using Web 3 platforms for freelancers]]:

*   **Platform Risk**: If the platform ceases to exist, the funding wallet, which is secured by the platform and not directly accessible to either party, may also become inaccessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:50">[03:52:50]</a>.
*   **Human Bias in Disputes**: Although dispute agents are intended to make independent decisions, the human element can still introduce bias into the dispute resolution process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:47">[04:04:47]</a>.

The use cases for Trust Treaty are seen as very interesting, especially with the growing amount of remote work in the Web3 space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:40">[03:41:40]</a>.

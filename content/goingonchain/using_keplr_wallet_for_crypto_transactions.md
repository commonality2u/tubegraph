The Keplr wallet is a tool within the Cosmos ecosystem designed for managing and transferring crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. It is particularly useful for bridging assets like UST across different chains.

## Transferring Assets with Keplr

To use Keplr for transfers, assets like UST (Terra USD) typically need to be moved from a Terra Wallet Station to the Keplr wallet itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Once the assets are in the Keplr wallet, users can specify the amount they wish to transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The wallet will then prompt the user to approve the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Transaction Costs and Speed

Sending a transaction via Keplr typically incurs a small fee, for instance, approximately 0.004 LUNA for a UST transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. After approving the transaction, it usually takes three to five minutes for the transaction to be completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Once complete, the transferred assets, such as UST, will appear in the designated destination wallet, like MetaMask on Avalanche (AVAX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

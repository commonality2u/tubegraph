The process of [[crypto_portfolio_strategy | building a cryptocurrency investment portfolio]] involves understanding risk, managing assets, and securing holdings. The speaker intends to share their personal [[cryptocurrency_investment_approach | portfolio]] and journey, including different risk profiles, to assist those looking to get [[investing_in_cryptocurrency | started]] in the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## Getting Started

To help individuals begin [[investing_in_cryptocurrency | investing in cryptocurrency]], the speaker has developed multiple [[cryptocurrency_investment_approach | portfolios]] each tailored to a different risk profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>. They plan to openly share their personal experience and [[cryptocurrency_investment_approach | investment journey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.

## Risk Management and Insurance

A critical principle for cryptocurrency holders is "not your keys, not your coins," emphasizing the importance of direct control over one's digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.

For individuals with a substantial [[investing_in_cryptocurrencies_like_bitcoin_ethereum_and_dogecoin | position]] in decentralized finance (DeFi), acquiring [[managing_risk_with_crypto_investments | insurance]] is advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. Services like Insure, while not covering all protocols (e.g., Grim Finance), do provide coverage for other Phantom ecosystem protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. For example, if holding a large [[investing_in_cryptocurrencies_like_bitcoin_ethereum_and_dogecoin | position]] in Abracadabra, [[managing_risk_with_crypto_investments | insurance]] can be purchased to allow for claims in the event of a hack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. The speaker personally uses Anchor Protocol [[managing_risk_with_crypto_investments | insurance]], though it often becomes unavailable quickly, requiring frequent checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. A referral code is available for discounts on [[managing_risk_with_crypto_investments | insurance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

## Lessons Learned

One significant [[key_takeaways_and_lessons_learned_in_crypto_investing | lesson learned]] from personal experience, following a loss due to a hack, is the importance of "not your keys, not your coins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

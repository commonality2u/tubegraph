From: [[goingonchain]] <br/> 

While [[metamask_connection_for_anchor_deposits | Metamask]] has been a prominent wallet in the crypto space, new alternatives have emerged as the industry advances, offering different features and security benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Below are three notable alternatives.

## Brave Wallet

Brave Wallet is integrated directly into the Brave browser, eliminating the need for extra Chrome extensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This built-in functionality reduces the risk to the browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Features
*   **Integrated Design** The wallet boasts a user-friendly interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Multi-chain Connectivity** It connects to various blockchain networks, similar to [[metamask_connection_for_anchor_deposits | Metamask]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Tracking** A dedicated portfolio page pulls price data from CoinGecko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Weaknesses
*   **Limited Coin Tracker** The coin tracker is not highly effective, often failing to track LP tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Manual Token Addition** Users frequently need to manually add new or unrecognized tokens, unlike [[metamask_connection_for_anchor_deposits | Metamask]] which might automatically display them upon purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For example, a "cre8r" token required manual addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Rabby Wallet

Developed by Debank, Rabby Wallet is available as a Chrome extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. While it claims to provide a smooth multi-chain experience, some users have reported occasional issues, such as misidentifying the active blockchain network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### Key Feature: Security Tab
Rabby Wallet features a powerful "Security" tab that provides enhanced control over token approvals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Approval List** It displays a list of all approvals a user has granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Risk Management** This feature allows users to see if they have given unlimited access to their tokens (e.g., USDC) to various protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This highlights the risk if a project becomes compromised, potentially affecting all approved funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Revocation** Rabby Wallet enables users to decline or revoke approvals for unknown or questionable projects, a functionality not available in [[metamask_connection_for_anchor_deposits | Metamask]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Argent Wallet

Argent is a "smart wallet" built on a smart contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Currently, it supports Ethereum (ETH) and Layer 2 ZKsync <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. It is often used for storing NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Activating the wallet requires a one-time gas fee due to its smart contract foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Unique Features
*   **Seed Phrase-less Login** Argent does not require users to remember a seed phrase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Instead, it uses email and phone for login <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The seed phrase is encrypted and split between Argent and iCloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Guardian Feature** The "Guardian" feature allows users to designate a trusted contact (e.g., a spouse) as a guardian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. If a user loses their phone, the guardian can remotely lock the wallet, enhancing security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This security setup is a primary reason some users prefer Argent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

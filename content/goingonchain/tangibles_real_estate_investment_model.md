Tangible is a marketplace that [[converting_real_world_assets_into_nfts | converts real-world assets into NFTs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. While the platform allows for purchasing items like [[using_tangible_to_purchase_gold_bars_and_watches | gold bars and watches]] using USDC, its model also extends to real estate investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. When a purchase is made on Tangible, an NFT (tNFT) is minted, and the physical item is stored in a vault, incurring a storage fee primarily for [[storing_and_managing_highvalue_nfts with tangible | high-value items]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Users have the option to take physical delivery anytime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. A 2.5% platform fee is charged for items acquired from other sellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This fee is distributed, with 33% used to buy and burn Tangible tokens and 66.66% going to Tangible stakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Real Estate Investment on Tangible

Tangible offers a pathway for investors to engage with [[real_estate_and_blockchain_integration | real estate]] as a tokenized asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### Fractional and Full Ownership
Investors can acquire either a fraction of a real estate property or purchase all available fractions to own the entire property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The primary focus of this investment model is on capital appreciation and rental yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. For instance, a property might generate a rent of $494 per month, with a net yield of approximately 15.17%, which includes both capital appreciation and rental yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Yield and Fees
When calculating yield, investors must account for [[impact_of_supply_and_expenses_on_valuation_models | management and other fees]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This is because Tangible undertakes the responsibility for legal processes, maintenance, and related administrative work for the property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Investment Activation
There is a minimum fraction requirement for purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Importantly, simply buying a fraction does not immediately initiate yield generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The yield commences only after all fractions of a specific property have been sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## USDR Stablecoin Backing

Given that Tangible deals with real estate and other physically available assets, these holdings are leveraged to back the [[usdr_stablecoin_backed_by_tangible_assets | USDR stablecoin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. USDR is an over-collateralized stablecoin, backed by a diversified mix of real estate assets, Tangible tokens, DAI, and protocol-owned liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

Learning from past incidents (like the UST incident), Tangible has implemented measures to prevent USDR from entering a "death spiral" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. To mint USDR using their native token, at least 88% of other assets must be in place as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. Currently, USDR offers a yield of 4.25%, which Tangible aims to subsidize and increase to between 6% and 9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Tangible Tokens

Tangible tokens play a crucial role within the ecosystem. They are used for minting USDR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a> and receive revenue from product sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The platform applies a "ve-concept" for Tangible tokens: staking and locking tokens converts them into an NFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The longer the tokens are locked, the higher the rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Should a user wish to exit their position, they can sell their NFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

It is crucial to be aware of the many scams circulating in the cryptocurrency space to ensure [[importance_of_cryptocurrency_security | personal security]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. One prevalent scam involves USDT (Tether) and targets the gas fees required for transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## The USDT Gas Fee Scam Explained

This scam typically begins with contact on social media platforms like Telegram or Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

### Initial Approach
A scammer will DM you, providing a wallet address and seed phrase, claiming they are unable to withdraw assets themselves due to difficulty, such as being sick, and ask for your help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

### The Lure
Upon loading the provided wallet, you will see a significant amount of USDT, for example, 1135 USDT, but no gas (TRX on the Tron network) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### The Trap
The scam hinges on the victim attempting to "help" by loading gas into the wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The moment gas (e.g., TRX) is deposited, it is immediately sent to another wallet, effectively stolen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This is a common way [[how_cryptocurrency_wallets_are_manipulated_in_scams | cryptocurrency wallets are manipulated in scams]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Technical Details of the Scam Wallet

Understanding how the scam wallet is configured is key to recognizing this type of fraud.

### Discrepancy in Wallet Permissions
When examining a scam wallet, such as one with the address 'gt9h', on a blockchain explorer like Tronscan:
*   The 'Owner Permission' is not the same as the wallet address provided (e.g., it might be 'w19c') <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   Similarly, the 'Active Permission' (which grants access) also belongs to a different address (e.g., 'w19c') <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Failed Attempts to Edit Permissions
If you try to "help" by editing the access and putting your own address to facilitate the withdrawal, clicking 'save' will cost you TRX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This TRX is immediately sent to another wallet, just like the initial gas deposit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Comparison with a Normal Wallet
In a legitimate wallet, the 'Owner Permission' and 'Active Permission' keys will match the wallet's public address (e.g., 'knifi au' for both the address and permissions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This consistency is a vital aspect of [[security_measures_for_cryptocurrency_wallets | security measures for cryptocurrency wallets]].

## The Scammer's Accumulation Wallet

The gas fees stolen from victims are continuously sent to a central scammer's wallet (e.g., '2qpe') <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This wallet quickly accumulates significant amounts; for instance, it accumulated about $2,000 in just 16 minutes through multiple transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Why People Fall For It

Despite how sophisticated the scam might seem, people do fall victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Some individuals, out of a desire to help or even believing they are tricking scammers themselves, end up sending TRX to these wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. However, innocent people are also affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This highlights the ongoing need for [[crypto_scam_awareness | crypto scam awareness]].

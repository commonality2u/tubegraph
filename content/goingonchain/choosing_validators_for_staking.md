Staking Luna allows holders to earn more Luna and receive airdrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This process involves [[Proof of work vs proof of stake | staking]] Luna through a validator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## How to [[Proof of work vs proof of stake | Stake]] Luna

To [[Proof of work vs proof of stake | stake]] Luna, navigate to your Terra wallet and click on "staking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Here, you will find a list of 105 validators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Understanding Validator Metrics

Validators can be sorted by uptime, commission, or voting power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. When choosing a validator, consider the following metrics:

*   **Voting Power:** This indicates the validator's influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
    > [!WARNING] Decentralization
    > It is typically not recommended to [[Proof of work vs proof of stake | stake]] with the top 5 validators to avoid centralizing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Self-delegation:** This is the amount a validator delegates to themselves, demonstrating their commitment ("skin in the game") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. A higher self-delegation is generally preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Commission:** This is the percentage the validator takes from your rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Validators with zero percent commission are ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. For more information, see [[understanding_validator_commission_and_uptime | Understanding validator commission and uptime]].
*   **Uptime:** Validators should have 100% uptime, as you will not earn rewards if they are not working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. For more information, see [[understanding_validator_commission_and_uptime | Understanding validator commission and uptime]].

## Delegating Luna

Once you have chosen a validator, click "delegate," input the desired amount of Luna, and proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. After completion, you can view a summary of your delegated amount and earned rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Earning Rewards and Airdrops

Beyond Luna rewards, [[Proof of work vs proof of stake | staking]] also grants eligibility for special airdrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
